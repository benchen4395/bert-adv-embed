I am a 11th grader at my high school In my Current World Affairs class a kid in my class had this video and suggested we watch So we did I am firm believer that we went to the moon being that my father works for NASA Even though I think this movie is the biggest piece of crap I have ever watched the guy who created it has some serious balls First of all did he have to show JFK getting shot And how dare he use all those biblical quotes The only good thing about this movie is it sparks debates which is good b c in my class we have weekly debates This movie did nothing to change my mind I think he and Michael Moore should be working together and make another movie Michael Moore next movie could be called A Funny Thing Happened on Spetember 11th or A Funny thing happened on the way to the white house
this documentary is founded on sponge cake as soon as you put any REAL evidence on it the integrity slowly sinks into a big pile of crap for example Bart Sibrel claims they must have had multiple lighting sources because the shadows appear to be crossing if this were the case wouldn t there be two or more shadows for each object when Apollo 11 went through the van Allan radiation belts they spent 30 Min s there not the 90 Min s claimed in the documentary and they received a dose of radiation more equivalent to that of an an x ray br br seriously do some research learn what really happened don t let this pile of crap of a documentary mold your opinion of what really happened
I notice that most of the people who think this film speaks the truth were either not born before the moon landings 1969 1972 or not old enough to appreciate them I think it is much easier to question an historic event if you did not live through it br br I was a youngster at the time of Apollo but I was old enough to understand what was going on The entire world followed the moon landings Our families gathered around the TV to watch the launch Newspaper headlines screamed the latest goings on each day from launch to landing from moonwalks to moon liftoff all the way to splashdown in a multitude of languages In school some classes were cancelled so we could watch the main events on TV During Apollo 13 the world prayed and held its collective breath as the men limped home to an uncertain fate You couldn t go anywhere without someone asking what the latest was The world was truly one community br br Now with a buffer of 30 odd years after the fact it is easy to claim fraud because worldwide enthusiasm and interest has died down We are left with our history books and anybody can claim that history is wrong and attempt to prove it with a bunch of lies and made up facts while completely ignoring the preponderance of evidence showing otherwise not to mention the proof that dwells in the souls and memories of those who lived through these wonderfully heady and fantastic days
This so called documentary tries to tell that USA faked the moon landing Year right br br All those who have actually studied the case knows different br br First of all there is definitely proof When the astronauts was on the moon they brought back MANY pounds of rock from the moon for geological studies These where spread around the world to hundreds of labs who tested them And they all concluded that they came from the same planet not earth because the inner isotopes of the basic elements are different from those found on earth but similar to those calculated to be on the moon I E the conspiracy theorists never studies anything they only take the thing that fit into their theory and ignores the rest br br Another wrongful claim from them is that their was wind in the hangar where they shot the moon landing I E the flag moves There is a logical explanation the astronaut moved it with his hand so it moved And what proves this well if the conspiracy theorists even studied the footage they would see that the flag NEVER moves after the astronaut have let it be I E the conspiracy theorists are bad scientists they cant study a subject properly or only studies it until they have what they came for so that they can make a lie from that and make a profit I E this so called documentary br br A claim says that it cant possible have been filmed on the moon because all the shadows come from different places because there are different light sources the artificial lighting from the studio Once again the conspiracy theorists are wrong as usual the same would happen in an earth desert at night with no light sources But i doubt that any Conspiracy theorists have ever been outside their grandmothers basement for more than how many days a Star Treck convention is held over br br The Conspiracy theorists are in denial BIG TIME They only see what they want to see So they make up all these lies to seem important that is a fact
The only reason I didn t score this a one is that Sibrel does show that he is adept at the technical aspects of making a film It is a technically adept film br br That having been said this is a film based on lies and distortions that are quite easily disproven Most of the documentary is spent using propaganda techniques to bash the space program rather than actual fact And Sibrel s irrefutable proof that the landings were faked is easily refuted if you know anything about orbital mechanics br br I do not recommend watching this but if you do see it at google video for free Don t let Bart Sibrel profit from your curiosity
When I was 16 I saw the documentary A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon I actually liked and believed in it for a couple of years But then I grew up and began to think and when I had sought more information This is more info from reel sources and non biased sources When I started at university not so long ago i asked an assistant professor in astronomy about these conspiracy theories What he said shocked me He said that all those theories where lies That baffled me I did not believe it first but then he presented evidence for his claims He quickly debunked most of the theories about the subject humans did not go to the moon The most outrages claim was that the Apollo craft could not travel through the Van Allen radiation Belt without the crew perishing from radiation The truth is that the Americans use a secret aluminum anti radiation alloy It is not that well known And the exact specifications are a secret And why is it a secret Well why should they reveal it back then If they where in a space race with the Russians then it would be VERY dumb to reveal that they had new technology that could shield crew against radiation br br And then there is the biggest evidence of all The Moon Stones When the Apollo missions DID go to the moon they brought back many rocks from the moon to give to geologists and similar scientists who are documenting all things about the moon These rocks and stones are IN FACT FROM THE MOON Because the internal basic elements which all matter consist of are also made of special isotopes that are different from quarry to quarry land to land and especially planet from planet The isotopes of these rocks and stones have been Proved that they do not come from earth The astronauts brought home HUNDREDS of Kilogram s of these rocks all of them have been proved to have come from outside earth and from the same planet Ergo The moon landings where not fake NASA did go to another planet the moon though it is not a planet but a satellite to a planet a moon duuh These rocks have been distributed to laboratories and universities all around the world It has been proved Humans did go to the moon it is a fact pronto br br But I do not worry most conspiracy theorists are generally unemployed and uneducated that is mostly why they do not know or lie about these facts The fact remains Humans did walk on the moon
The views of Earth that are claimed in this film to have been faked by NASA have recently been compared with the historical weather data for the time of Apollo 11 and show a good match between the cloud patterns in the video sequence and the actual rainfall records on the day br br This would seem to undermine the entire argument put forward in the film that the whole Earth picture is actually a small part of the planet framed by the spacecraft window br br I am waiting for Bart Sibrel to now claim that the historical weather data has been faked by NASA though that would no doubt involve them in also replacing every archived newspaper copy with a weather map and the ones in private hands would still be a problem br br Ah a response Trying to discredit this movie by referring to NASA weather data I d say is a charming but weak and gullible argument What about the rest of the footage and proofs in the movie A certain wise man once said something about sifting mosquitoes and swallowing camels Do you in any way feel that maybe this could apply to what you are trying to do here This movie is just packed with irrefutable evidence against the claim once made by U S government that the moon missions were a success and that man now are true masters of the universe Things are nearly never quite what they seem Just watch the movie and I dear say you ll see things a bit different than before br br First off weather data doesn t come from NASA it comes for met agencies around the world Second the weather data undermines a major claim in the film Third far from being packed with irrefutable evidence the remaining claims in the film have been thoroughly debunked Sibrel thought he had a previously secret piece of film so he edited it and added his own interpretation Unfortunately for him his source film is public domain and the bits Sibrel edited out contradict his claims
There are so many incorrect statements in this so called documentary that I found myself shouting at the television br br Bart Sibrel might be able to produce a flashy looking DVD but he is sadly lacking at looking at the science behind his claims br br He relies on either being inaccurate not telling the full story or the old favourite government always lies to us innuendos and people believing what is told to them and not checking on the accuracy or details behind the claims br br What s more his exclusive or unreleased footage is freely available over the internet from various sites br br Further reading about the circumstances regarding the filming of this production shows that he used false pretenses to gain interviews and has used creative editing of the responses in order to promote his own opinions br br All of the claims made by Mr Sibrel about inaccuracies mistakes or whistleblowing in the Apollo programme have been thoroughly disproven br br How do I get that 40 odd minutes of my life back
I watched this video at a friend s house I m glad I did not waste money buying this one The video cover has a scene from the 1975 movie Capricorn One The movie starts out with several clips of rocket blow ups most not related to manned flight Sibrel s smoking gun is a short video clip of the astronauts preparing a video broadcast He edits in his own voice over instead of letting us listen to what the crew had to say The video curiously ends with a showing of the Zapruder film His claims about radiation shielding star photography and others lead me to believe is he extremely ignorant or has some sort of ax to grind against NASA the astronauts or American in general His science is bad and so is this video
Writer Director Bart Sibrel bases his work here around a can of film that he says was mistakenly sent to him by NASA He says it shows the astronauts faking the television footage of their trip to the moon by employing camera tricks The astronauts were in low Earth orbit all the time and editors on the ground composed this raw footage into just a few seconds of finished film br br Unfortunately Sibrel s research is so slipshod that he doesn t realize his backstage footage is really taken in large part from the 30 minute live telecast also on that reel that was seen by millions not hidden away in NASA vaults as he implies And we have to wonder why Sibrel puts his own conspiratorial narration over the astronauts audio in the footage because hearing the astronauts in their own words clearly spells out that the astronauts were just testing the camera not faking footage br br Finally anyone can see the raw footage for themselves without having to buy Sibrel s hacked up version of it He shows you more of the Zapruder film of JFK s assassination than of his smoking gun Sibrel thinks he s the only one who s seen it What s more revealing is the clips from that raw footage that Sibrel chose NOT to use such as those clearly showing the appropriately distant Earth being eclipsed by the window frames and so forth destroying his claim that mattes and transparencies were placed in the spacecraft windows to create the illusion of a faraway Earth br br As with most films of this type Sibrel relies on innuendo inexpert assumption misleading commentary and selective quotation to manipulate the viewer into accepting a conclusion for which there is not a shred of actual evidence
There is a remark that one of heroines was raped on drunken rampage by Russian soldiers which is completely untrue This movie should not be shown only because of this br br Also there is a statement by someone that KGB prosecuted Jews Gypsies etc which is worse than Nazis KGB was looking for so called zionist agents who were KGB believed imperialist agents This is totally different from targeting Jewry as a whole nation as Nazis did Gypsies were never prosecuted KGB was political tool and used politically but from internationalist standpoint Communists really did not distinguish between nationalities br br Whole movie stinks like fake Main hero does not speak Russian signs in Berlin contains typographical errors KGB general looks totally phony Some so called russian proverbs are totally made up and list goes on and on br br Not recommended to watch this movie is full of lies and phony stuff Go to Good shepherd instead
I was really looking forward to this show given the quality of the actors and the fact that The Scott brothers were involved Unfortunately my hopes were dashed Yet again we are led to believe that the KGB are a group of inept morons who don t have a clue what they are doing At one point there is a laughable scene where 4 KGB agents couldn t handle one CIA agent I grow weary of these biased one sided and completely inaccurate portrayals of the Spy game that went on during the cold war I find it laughable that the US is incapable of making objective movies about their involvement in WW2 and beyond Just like the pathetic U 571 where we are led to believe that the US obtained the Enigma machine again utterly false br br To its credit The Company is very well filmed and acted The locales are also exceptionally well realised Alfred Molina puts in a great performance as does Keaton The conflict between them is very well done I really wanted to like this show and no doubt I will end up watching the other 2 episodes but I really wish that US productions would stop trying to portray their Spies servicemen etc as supermen who are vastly intellectually and physically superior to anyone else on the planet It gets old fast and seriously detracts from the plausibility of what could have been a 10 10 br br S
I do regret that I have bought this series I expected more action more objective picture and more consistency This is just a pure propaganda series very dark without any charm or romanticism it is just boredom itself I find the actors work quite weak as well O Donnell might seem charming as Robin with Batman but in this picture he lacks any charm Probably while he becomes older he is loosing his childish charm but does not gain any charm of a grown up It comes as no surprise that it was not shown in a lot of countries and is being sold in the UK for 40 of the recommended price and was not even released in the Netherlands
Proof that not everything Tarantino touches turns to gold This is most definitely plastic all the way Its easy to see that without Quentin s involvement this would have probably sat on the shelf for years that s assuming it would have ever got produced in the first place It is about a woman with a fascination of death who gets a job cleaning up after crime scenes Angela Jones is unconvincing in this role William Baldwin is better as the Serial Killer who keeps Jones in employment All in all pretty poor
Thoughtless ignorant ill conceived career killing where is the talented Angela Jones now deeply unfunny garbage It s no wonder Reb Braddock hasn t directed anything else since anyone who has a chance to make his first film on his own rules based on his own script with the help of Quentin Tarantino himself and creates something like THIS anyone who feels that THIS was a story worth telling to the world doesn t deserve a second break Under the circumstances the performances are good the actors do what they re told to do and they do it well It s just that they shouldn t have done it in the first place br br 0 out of 4
From it s uninspiring title to the flat acting performances Curdled is very much an unremarkable film throughout The film has gained some fans by way of the fact that Quentin Tarantino s name is attached to it and the silly and out of place nod to the Rodriguez Tarantino flick From Dusk till Dawn These things do not make a great movie however and this is more than evident all the way through Curdled The film suffers from an all too obvious lack of ideas and it tries to mask this with murders that are meant to be stylish and events that are supposed to be disturbing The Mexican music score that accompanies many of the sequences in the film is obviously meant to be cool but it s becomes annoying very quickly especially as aside from the fact that the lead character is Mexican it doesn t fit with the tone of the movie The film s plot is typically offbeat and it follows a gorehound who because of her obsession with grisly murders takes a job with a firm that cleans up murder scenes It sounds boring and it is br br William Baldwin is the only name on the cast list and even he doesn t make an impression He hasn t been given anything to do in the movie and aside from talking to his victims and standing around trying to look menacing he s pretty much wasted Angela Jones or rather the taxi driver from Pulp Fiction takes the lead role as the murder obsessed young woman and it is always clear that it s her involvement with Pulp Fiction that won her this role not her acting ability She may have been good enough in her small role in Tarantino s masterpiece but she doesn t have the talent to lead a film by herself She looks lost and out of place for the majority of the film and if it weren t for her Latino accent she wouldn t convince the audience that she s a weirdo on any level Curdled is a one hundred percent proof piece of forgettable trash Films like this often win themselves praise for invention or black comedic antics but this one fails on all levels Whether you re a Tarantino fan William Baldwin fan horror fan or just a movie buff this is one to miss
Excruciatingly slow paced over scripted black comedy with a too clever premise and bad acting br br Maybe this would have worked as a Twilight Zone or Tales from the Crypt episode but by the last half you just want it to get to its predictable ending and be done with it already
Geordies salt of the earth characters bricklayers beer Geordies happy go lucky adventures working abroad salt of the earth characters warm wonderful people Tyne Bridge tear in the eye brown ale salt of the earth characters cute little Red Indians children in Newcastle United tops emetic Geordies salt of the earth characters br br etc etc etc br br Please This is so poor And you should know better Timothy Spall They can t have paid you that much br br As for Jimmy Nail Well the kindest thing that can be said is that he is every bit as good an actor as he is a singer and writer Come on Jimmy the joke s over Crocodile Shoes and Spender were very funny unfortunately I don t think they were supposed to be With Auf Wiedersehen Pet the opposite applies
Usually I m a bit of a fan of the bad eighties early nineties film featuring now has beens but this film is so incredibly terrible that it was a real endurance test to sit through Guys dressing up as girls has been done to death but never so pathetically Corey Haim s performance was abysmal as usual Nicole Eggert was not much better This has no redeeming qualities even if you are a number 1 fan of an actor actress in this piece of trash stay away
Well here we have yet another role reversal movie There were many worth watching despite the tired plot of gender reversal However this one is not In previous reviews I think I ve made my point about the general decline of enjoyment for Haim movies that followed the late 80s This is one of them br br Just One of the Girls is about a high school kid Corey Haim who tries to avoid his bullies by dressing up as a girl and attending another school He joins the cheerleading squad and makes friends with fellow cheerleader Marie Nicole Eggert Obviously he can t keep up the charade for too much longer br br I thought this movie was utter crap and it wasn t even funny But judging by a majority of reviews it looks like fans of Alanis Morrisette or teen sex queen Nicole Eggert are the only ones who d want to watch this If you re looking for a good Haim feature or role switching comedy look no further than 1989 This is about the point that Haim s career tanked
I d never seen a Tarzan movie before so when I saw it on the tele I thought I d give it a shot Unfortunately I have to say I was disappointed Tarzan was over 40 years old and somewhat overweight Not how I d imagined Tarzan would look And unless I missed it while making myself a cup of tea Tarzan never gave his traditional warbling yell Also missing was Tarzan swinging through the trees leaping from vine to vine br br Oh well so much for expectations Anyway Jane was there The monkey Cheeta was there There was some guy with a guitar there There were villains and good guys and a romance all very harmless and predictable Nothing bad you understand but equally nothing good br br Probably not the best movie to introduce Tarzan 4 10
Last of the Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan films and a good thing too as this is easily the worst of the 12 films he made over a period of 16 years No mermaids are featured here either as a beautiful island woman tries to escape the clutches of her people who worship a god and try to force her to be its bride She finds Tarzan and Jane who try to protect her George Zucco is present as a potentially villainous High Priest but isn t used to his full advantage Also on hand and worthy of mention is a hugely annoying guitar player singer who goes into song every so often Even the great Robert Florey can t aid this one br br 1 2 of four
The last Tarzan film starring Johnny Weissmuller looking surprisingly aged a year after Tarzan and the Huntress is bad in spite of all the trivia one can add to make it look better It is obvious that RKO tried to make a great farewell for Weissmuller shooting in beautiful scenery in México with a top star of that country Andrea Palma and multiple award winning cinematographer Gabriel Figueroa and bringing in prestigious composer Dimitri Tiomkin to do the score Although it may have cost less for filming abroad it looks more expensive than any other RKO film in the series taking advantage of Acapulco beaches and real pyramids as Aquatania and with impressive décors for all the scenes related to the temple of god Balu especially the exterior built on steep rocks Kurt Neumann should have stayed as director instead of Robert Florey who gives it a very slow pace Neumann had done a fine work with Tarzan and the Amazons Tarzan and the Leopard Woman and Tarzan and the Huntress and finished his career directing the classic The Fly the year before his death while Florey became a television director after a career of few remarkable films If Weissmuller looks tired the chimp playing Cheeta is not as good as the others but the worst character is Benji an obnoxious mailman who sings horrendous songs that have a Caribbean air in a location supposed to be Africa and shot in México Boring and decidedly of dubious taste it was a sad farewell to Weissmuller s Tarzan
The finale of the Weissmuller Tarzan movies is a rather weak one There are a few things that derail this film br br First Tarzan spends much of the film wearing floppy sandals In my opinion any footwear on Tarzan whether it be sandals or boots as sometimes portrayed takes away from the character which is supposed to be anti civilization and pro jungle br br Second the character of Benji as mentioned in a previous post totally derails the movie as the comic foil To me his character is unnecessary to the film s plot br br Also while Weissmuller still cuts a commanding figure as Tarzan it s apparent that he was not in his best shape Although in his later Jungle Jim movies his physique had improved somewhat from this film br br The octopus battle is a terrific idea but I think it should have been done in an earlier Weissmuller film when he was at his physical peak Likewise the battle which takes only 30 seconds tops would be much more thrilling if it was drawn out to 90 seconds to 2 minutes like the classic giant crocodile battle in Tarzan and His Mate br br And while Brenda Joyce as Jane and Linda Christian as Mara are overwhelmingly pleasing to the eye it doesn t manage to salvage this last Weissmuller film a disappointing ending to a great character run
Johnny Weissmuller s final film as King of the Jungle after 16 years in the role TARZAN AND THE MERMAIDS is bound to disappoint all but the most ardent of his fans At 44 the ex Olympian one of Hollywood s most active party animals was long past the slim athleticism of his youth and looked tired although he was in marginally better condition than in his previous entry TARZAN AND THE HUNTRESS br br Not only had Weissmuller gotten too old for his role Johnny Sheffield the quintessential Boy had grown to manhood he was a strapping 17 year old so he was written out of the script under the pretext of being away at school Brenda Joyce at 35 was appearing in her fourth of five films as Jane she would provide the transition when Lex Barker became the new Tarzan in 1949 s TARZAN S MAGIC FOUNTAIN and was still as wholesomely sexy as ever br br Produced by Sol Lesser at RKO on a minuscule budget the cast and crew took advantage of cheaper labor by filming in Mexico While the location gave a decidedly Hispanic air to what was supposedly darkest Africa veteran director Robert Florey utilized the country extensively incorporating cliff diving and an Aztec temple into the story br br When a young island girl Tyrone Power s future bride Linda Christian is rescued in a jungle river by Tarzan he learns that a local high priest George Zucco one of filmdom s most enduring villains had virtually enslaved the local population threatening retribution from a living God if they don t do his bidding The girl had been chosen to become the God s bride so she fled Faster than you can say Is this a dumb plot or WHAT the girl is kidnapped by the priest s henchmen and returned to the island and Tarzan followed by Jane colorful Spanish character Benjy charmingly played by John Laurenz who sings several tunes and a government commissioner are off to take on the Deity and his priest poor Cheeta is left behind After a series of discoveries the God is simply a con man in an Aztec mask working with the priest in milking the island s rich pearl beds a bit of brawling action and comic relief and songs by Benjy everything reaches the expected happy conclusion br br Remarkably TARZAN AND THE MERMAIDS features a musical score by the brilliant film composer Dimitri Tiomkin and is far better than what you d expect from this B movie br br While the film would provide a less than auspicious end to Weissmuller s time in Tarzan s loincloth he would immediately go on to play Jungle Jim a more eloquent variation of the Ape Man in khakis the talent involved lifted the overall product at least a little above the total mess it could have been br br Tarzan was about to get a make over and become much sexier
This movie is without a doubt the worst horror movie I ve ever seen And that s saying a lot considering I ve seen such stinkers like Demon of Paradise Lovers Lane and Bloody Murder which is a close second However I love bad horror movies and as you can tell from my username this one really sticks out At times there s nothing more entertaining than a poorly made slasher flick As for this film the opening scene in which a woman gets fried in a tanning booth appears to have no bearing on the film whatsoever especially since the movie fails to tell you that the event happened 2 years prior to the rest of the film The acting is nonexistent and most of the camera shot are of women s areas shrink wrapped in spandex The policeman was the most stone faced monotone actor I ve ever seen The best worst part of this movie however has to be the murder weapon A giant safety pin What were they thinking Who s the killer A disgruntled Huggies employee I d have to give this movie an overall zero but darned if I didn t have a blast watching it
Want to know the secret to making a slasher film set at a fitness center work Just pad the film out with lovely ladies in super tight workout outfits and have them bump and grind the floor like they are at a gentleman s club That s what the makers of this horrid slasher film did and that little gimmick kept me watching till the bitter end This is the worst slasher film I have ever seen but every time I was ready to switch the channel they d add another scene with the workout girls and I d stay put As a slasher film Killer Workout fails in every category I can think of As a showcase for beautiful girls working out it is a success Strong recommendation to avoid unless the thought of half the film being a big T A show appeals to you
You know Jason you know Freddy and you know Leatherface Now get ready for The Safety Pin Killer That s right in Killer Workout a dumb slasher movie if I ve ever seen one the unseen murderer dispatches his or her victims with an oversized novelty safety pin It is an odd choice to be sure the kind of thing that deserves an explanation Naturally the movie never even attempts to clarify where the killer acquired such a thing br br As the title suggests an aerobics gym is under siege by a mad killer and everyone is a suspect In fact the movie gives so few clues as to the identity of the killer just about everyone in the movie is a potential murderer until they get killed And since just about everyone but the killer winds up dead it s really just process of elimination br br Oddly while the entire name cast is killed off the aerobics classes continue in earnest In fact nothing is capable of stopping the dancing While three men are murdered in the next room the workout goes on Death isn t even a factor one character dies but is still seen prominently in the later workout sessions Director David Prior knew what he was doing when named the movie Killer Workout and not Logical Workout br br Cop chases explosive tanning beds and hundreds of shots of women s exposed flesh are thrown in for good measure Much like the woman caught in the tanning bed I felt very uncomfortable by the end of Killer Workout Finally thankfully THE END flashed on the screen What happened next You got it shots of the women working out Not even the end of the movie can stop them br br
One two three four five six seven eight and back haha This is a must see first of all to see the work out There are a lot of work out shown see those close ups man you will enjoy it A few years ago a video clip was surely based on this movie It s a slasher but without suspense The ending is funny too and the clothes she s wearing in the wood confronting the copper Jesus looks like a clown The killings are mostly done off screen the blood flows but never too gory There are a lot of fight scene s too and hey no one got hurt And what about the weapon to kill never seen a big one like that won t spoil it you must see it And being a slasher there s a lot of T A too To guess who s the killer you will be trapped a few times and that s the best part but what about the story of the copper in the woods huh But still due his cheesiness this one is still one that many would like to have I m glad that I have my copy one of those slasher failures But man those clothes and not to mention the hairstyles If you are in your 40 s then this is one is back to memory lane
Big hair big boobs bad music and a giant safety pin these are the words to best describe this terrible movie I love cheesy horror movies and i ve seen hundreds but this had got to be on of the worst ever made The plot is paper thin and ridiculous the acting is an abomination the script is completely laughable the best is the end showdown with the cop and how he worked out who the killer is it s just so damn terribly written the clothes are sickening and funny in equal measures the hair is big lots of boobs bounce men wear those cut tee shirts that show off their stomachs sickening that men actually wore them and the music is just synthesiser trash that plays over and over again in almost every scene there is trashy music boobs and paramedics taking away bodies and the gym still doesn t close for bereavement All joking aside this is a truly bad film whose only charm is to look back on the disaster that was the 80 s and have a good old laugh at how bad everything was back then
This is quite possibly the most retarded 80 s slasher ever realized but how can you be harsh on a film that features non stop images of dozens of gorgeous ladies with exhilarating bodies doing aerobic exercises taking showers and wandering about in tight gym outfits Prior to being a horror film Aerobicide is a 90 minutes promo video to encourage the use of steroids silicons and other body stimulating fitness products If you d leave out all the footage of hunky boys lifting weights and yummy girls wiggling their butts and racks to insufferable 80 s tunes there probably only have about 15 minutes of story left Plenty of time to improvise a plot about a sadist killer slaughtering young health freaks with a big safety pin yeah The film opens with an unintentionally hilarious scene of a girl getting fried between an electric sun bathing device Several years later people turn up dead in the same spa You don t really need to be an experienced horror fanatic or a rocket scientist to figure out there s a link between the murders and the burning incident now do you Investigating the case are a seemingly braindead police officer and Charles Napier look alike and a beefcake private detective who gets lucky with the bustiest 80 s beauty I ve ever seen Looking through the credits her name s Dianne Copeland apparently and she didn t do anything else apart from this turkey and an imbecile Troma movie called Surf Nazis Must Die What a wasted opportunity She may not have been a great actress but she sure had two other BIG advantages that would help her move upwards in show business The amount of gore and the quality of the make up effects are nothing special neither We re treated to a couple of bizarre stabbings with a pin and some barbecued human flesh The plot twists near the end are ridiculous and predictable but by that time nobody is taking the film seriously anymore anyway Aerobicide a k a Killer Workout is recommended in case you want to switch of all your brain functions off for one night but nevertheless feel like watching a film It actually would make a terrific double feature with Death Spa Both films have a lot of sexy and scarcely dressed babes and both films are pretty dumb
What can I say A Kamal Hassan movie being horrible He acts very well but it is a horrible story along with horrible direction In my kind opinion the director Gautham Menon must give up directing There is a lot of tragedy throughout the movie Apart from that one can just not believe how true were those horrendous crimes There was no practicality in the movie Gautham is just running out of stories But both Kamal Hassan and Jyothika act really well The villains look too ugly though their performance was not bad I do not think this is a Sunday afternoon movie like Padayappa which you can see with the family You will not get sleep seeing this movie However Harris Jayaraj again did a great job and that is why I have given this movie 4 out of 10 His song Partha Modail Nallae is soulful and soothing Apart from that great cinematography On the whole this is just a bad bad movie Kamal Hassan I think should have rejected this movie
I had a lot of hopes for this movie and so watched it with a lot of expectations basically because of Kamal Hassan He is an amazing actor who has marked his foot steps in the sands of time forever But this movie proved to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen After watching this the movie the brutality and violence in tenebra and clockwork orange looks far better br br The Protagonist Raghavan is a very daring police officer Who is assigned to a investigate brutal serial murders Raghavan efficiently finds the connecting thread in this case and is close to solve the murders and put the psycho killers two psychologically disturbed but brilliant medical students behind bars but they escape and again get into a killing spree Finally Raghavan kills them both after sparing many innocent lives br br THese two psycho killers are the ones who are going to keep the audiences from going to the theaters The murders and sexual harassments and rapes are shown very explicitly which the movie could have survived without br br To even imagine that teenagers and kids are going to be watching this movie in the theater and kind of picture it is bound to paint in their minds are certainly not pretty The director Gautham should realize that he also has some obligation to the society and his audience Certainly i am never going to the movies looking like Gautham s name on the production list
On the way back from IMC6 San Jose California all five mind you three of us hardcore Kamal fans of us had reached a unanimous verdict VV was solid crap and thanks to the movie we were going to have a pretty screwed up Monday Not to mention we swore to stay off the theatres for the next year br br I won t blame Kamal here because he sort of dropped a hint in a recent interview with cartoonist Madan on Vijay TV He said something like Tamizh Cinema la Photography Editing la namba munnera na maadri Screenplay Direction Acting la innum namba munnera la Tamil Cinema has grown in terms of Photography and Editing but we have hardly improved when it comes to Screenplay Direction and Acting While you re watching VV those words ring very true br br Now here are the 10 Reasons to hate this movie br br 1 Harris Jeyaraj br br 2 Harris Jeyaraj br br 3 Harris Jeyaraj I m barely holding myself from using expletives here but fact is HJ has mastered the fine knack of screwing up every recent movie of his remember Anniyan Ghajini with the jarring cacophony he bills as background music The next time I have an eardrum transplant he s paying for it br br 4 Songs Neither do the songs help move the movie s narration spatially temporally nor do they make you sit up and take notice The film feels like it s made of four VERY long songs with a few scenes thrown in between them br br 5 A Short gone too far VV at best is fit to be a short story not a 2 hour plus thriller To use a cliché here like the Energizer bunny it goes on and on and on only in this case you don t want it to The later part of a movie feels like a big drag br br 6 Kamal Jothika pairing Two ice cubes rubbed together could ve produced more sparks than this lead pairing There s no reason you would root for them to make it together In fact every time they get together in the second half of the movie they make a good irritant to the narration Hate to say this but Kamalini Mukerjhee s 10 minute romancing does more than what Kamal and Jothika achieve in this movie plus Thenali br br 7 Kamal Haasan s accent Kamal has this pretentious accent that nobody speaks either in India or in the US and it isn t new either He s been doing it since Thoongadae Thambi Thoongadae It s simply gets on the nerve Imagine what havoc it can cause when his flair for using this strange accent meets shooting on location in the US He doesn t leave it at the Immigration either he offers doses of advice to his men bewildered TN Cops from Keeranor Sathoor and beyond in chaste Kamanglish Wha we hav here is plain bad police wok of course with nauseating effect br br 8 Logic There are a few directors whom you expect to stand up to a certain scale Gautam fails us badly with some crappy performance in the Department of common sense Which D C P in his senses would meet his love interest on the streets to discuss such matters as committing himself and life after The scene inside the theatre was so bad towards the climax we could hear people behind us loudly challenge the Hero s IQ Is he stupid can t he just use his Siren or Lights On a busy Madras road Kamal the cop on a police Jeep chases a guy on a bike just like any ordinary dude Can t he just use his gun The guy on a bike starts on foot and we have a fully geared Kamal in hot pursuit for a considerable amount of time I m not voting in favour of the later but I m just trying to explain the mood inside br br 9 Gore Violence If I wanted to watch women being raped their throats getting slashed more women getting raped and thrown into the bushes with excruciating authenticity I would sit at home and rather watch a Police Report or Kuttram The use of excessive violence should go in a way to extend the story not overwhelm it Somewhere down the line Gautum seems confused about what the extensions rapes murders are and what the mainstay story is br br 10 Even a double shot Espresso couldn t get the pain out of the head
Filmatography Excellent nice camera angles I don t remember seeing a movie of late with good close ups until this one Could have avoided gruesome scenes with a soft camera NY is pictured good I liked the upside down angles in particular a different touch br br Music Not impressive Songs don t stick around in your mind even after watching the movie May be I expected same quality like Anniyan A disappointment br br Actors Kamal needs to slowly pull away from hard core action sequences His age and belly really show up Also he should avoid close romantic sequences going forward It was a very awkward to see a mature aged star still trying to play like a 20 heroes scenes Love can be expressed at any age as we get older you still can express love nicely from a distance without touching a woman too much For example the love expressed by Rajinikanth in chandrmukhi br br Jyotika just appears for the namesake in the movie Not sure why she accepted this Well that is not my problem I guess br br Others just have a small presence br br Direction I expected Gautham to excel or measure up to his other movie Kakka Kakka He disappointmented me It took a long time to release the movie due to various issues He slips in few scenes Even abvious things got slipped from a famous director br br Overall Just a okay movie Too much graphics DEFINITELY not for kids and adults who expect some kind of Entertainment br br Thx

It s The F B I starring Reed Hadley with an all star guest cast The film begins with an accidental convenient kidnapping which leads to one thing and another which doesn t really indicate the main story which is a Big House U S A prison break story The story is very improbable to say the least It s like a TV show only more violent for the times br br BUT the cast is a trip Picture this Ralph Meeker is sent to prison his cell mates are the following criminals Broderick Crawford Lon Chaney Jr Charles Bronson reading a Muscle magazine and William Talman reading a Detective magazine Honest You should know that an early scene reveals what happens to the missing boy answering the ending voiceover If you don t want to have that hanging don t miss the opening scenes between the Iceman and the boy Peter Votrian doing well as a runaway asthmatic br br Big House U S A 1955 Howard W Koch Broderick Crawford Ralph Meeker Reed Hadley
I am definitely a Burt Reynolds fan but sorry this one really stinks Most of the dialogue is laughable and the only interesting plot twist is in the last five minutes of the movie I can t believe he even made this one Is he actually that hard up for money
The movie was not a waste except for some boring scenes in between But the women cast gave a pretty good show than the males who were laughable br br But Krista Allen really rocked in the movie Her voice was so seducing and sexy The scenes in the bed involving Krista should have shortened but she made it so watchable and sexier than any one could do Krista really is one of the best in such roles She also enacted quiet well as the baddie in the last 5 minutes which is the interesting part of the movie br br Burt Reynolds was not that good and this was not his best as an action star He could have chosen a better script than this Ireally think he did for money
A very tired looking Burt Reynolds plays a mercenary battling his former employers for some gizmo these non heroes plan to sell to the Iranians Low rent video nonsense by the producers of Silk Stalkings offers some decent action footage and a lot of ineptly staged drama a lack of logic and truly dreadful dialogue are the defining aspects although the final twists and allegiance shifts could ve been a nifty end to a better movie Burt still has presence although it also means you notice more when he mouths insultingly half baked one liners
About three minutes into this thing I started fast forwarding pausing only during the nudity why is it that bad movies always include such good looking women In ten minutes I was done and wishing I could get my money back from the rental store The people who write these movies should be sanctioned by the MPAA Come on writers the bad guys ALWAYS get into the car with the bomb activated by the good guy s remote control That s the way its been done since the days of the Ottoman Empire Also to add insult to injury the twist at the end was so formulaic that it could have come from any action movie written in the past 25 years Burt Reynolds was fine but he should concentrate on real movies br br This movie is just a waste of time Run away Run away
I am a big 1930 s movie fan and will watch most anything that I see on Turner Classic Movies thats new for me So I gave this a shot after all it s the great Harold Lloyd who rivaled Chaplin as a great silent film comedian I have watched much less of Lloyd s silent films then of Chaplins but I have to say I m a much bigger Chaplin fan Anyway this film fell so flat for me that I didn t finish it I can understand why his sound career was so limited he didn t get very good material to work with After you ve seen Chaplin Abbott and Costello The Three Stooges Martin and Lewis The Marx Brothers and Laurel and Hardy do boxing spoofs or violence in general this one is very forgettable I was also interested in watching Adolphe Menjou as I really enjoyed him in Paths Of Glory but his role here also did nothing special for me Maybe they should have gotten into the boxing sooner because at least half the film at least it seemed that way is before he gets in a ring I can tell there are a lot of Lloyd fans here and this wont be a popular review but I must rate this as compared to what else was out there at the time 4 out of 10 Don t watch this with anyone your trying to get to like old movies as they may not watch another one with you again very flat For an alternative to anyone who really liked this or is looking for more little known comedies in general I recommend Kelly The Second made a few years earlier another nobody becomes a boxer comedy with Patsy Kelly and in a supporting role Charles Chase These have both been shown on the Turner Classic Movies channel
Don t get fooled with all the big names like Burt Reynolds James Woods and Anne Archer They are just glorified extra s Their scenes were probably filmed in one day or so Whatever their motives for being in this movie if you have an actor like James Woods you better make good use of him To me this is a sign of bad direction through and through The plot itself wasn t that bad And the acting from most of the actors was above average Cuba Gooding Jr however was terrible He was so unbelievable that I almost laughed at his dramatic scenes And since this was meant as a serious movie that can t be a good thing The action scenes were not bad but they lacked that special punch to make it more exciting Again better direction was needed Also the pacing was wrong for a movie like this It took the main character almost half an hour to get in action For an action thriller of only 90 minutes that is far too slow The only redeeming factor is Angie Harmon She does her best to make it all work Too bad the director left her hanging Yes this movie could have been much better with a great director Andy Cheng is far too inexperienced as a director to pull it off And for an action stunt coordinator of his caliber you d expect at least more exciting action scenes Don t waste your time with this one Avoid
This Movie had some great actors in it Unfortunately they had forgotten how to act I was hoping the movie would get better as it went along but the acting was so robotic it was doomed from the very start It actually appeared that maybe the actors were reading from a script the whole time Maybe it was the Musical score or the Director himself but one thing is for sure the Make up artist needs to get another job The Facial Powder was so thick you could see it caked on the actors faces Would not recommend this movie to anyone no wonder it never hit the Theaters Cuba Gooding Jr James Woods shame on you guys for not giving it your all The Plot was great just needed a whole lot more
An ensemble of uninteresting and unlikeable characters twist and turn their way through a flimsy plot that might be interesting if only you could bring yourself to care This twisting and turning I speak of refers not to the story which contains all the suspense of a recipe for tuna casserole but to the director s inability to keep the characters faces even remotely centered in the frame On the other hand Angie Harmon has very nice nostrils and left ear br br The only real surprise in the movie is the big names they convinced to do it When you consider this movie was never released in theaters despite having an all star cast you might be inclined to think something stinks br br And indeed it does
Flat characters that you do not and never will care about Cringe inducing dialogue at places No twists they think they have one but if you didn t figure it out after about 40mins you re not too bright Lots of well know actors in roles and performances that fortunately for everyone involved will be forgotten as soon as the end credits roll br br I don t mind slow movies but they ve got to be going _somewhere_ This one doesn t br br The plot wasn t what made this a direct to DVD movie that s just a rather convenient excuse to try and drum up some fake controversy br br The as of writing 37 ten 10 ratings must be from people involved with the production
MST 3000 should do this movie It is the worst acted movie I have ever seen First of all you find out that the shooter has no bank account and no history since leaving the army in 1993 and pays his rent in cash There is no way in hell that a person like that would ever be allowed to be that close to a president not to mention a high profile job Also the head of security for the POTHUS would not be so emotional that he would start drinking into a haze if the president was shot This movie sucked I cannot express the extremite that this movie was Every single actor was terrible Even the chick at the trailer park I crap on this garbage What a waste of time
It had all the clichés of movies of this type and no substance The plot went nowhere and at the end of the movie I felt like a sucker for watching it The production was good however the script and acting were B movie quality The casting was poor because there were good actors mixed in with crumby actors The good actors didn t hold their own nor did they lift up the others br br This movie is not worthy of more words but I will say more to meet the minimum requirement of ten lines James Wood and Cuba Gooding Jr play caricatures of themselves in other movies br br If you are looking for mindless entertainment I still wouldn t recommend this movie
This movie was like a bad indie with A list talent The plot was silly all the way to the end It reminded me very much of something churned out for the home video market in the 1980 s I would have given it a one but there were brief moments when you could see the actors really really straining to make this worthwhile I think the worst thing was the underwater scene s held off of the dock The underwater lighting seemed to come from no were and whenever someone we were supposed to care about was close to running out of air this air tank would kind of appear I would avoid this unless there is nothing else on the shelf Good Day
This ranks as one of the worst movies I ve seen in years Besides Cuba and Angie the acting is actually embarrassing Wasn t Archer once a decent actress What happened to her The action is decent but completely implausible The make up is so bad it s worth mentioning I mean who ever even thinks about the makeup in a contemporary feature film Someone should tell the make up artist and the DOP that you re not supposed to actually see it The ending is a massive disappointment along the lines of and then they realized it was all a dream br br Don t waste your time or your money You re better off just staring into space for 2 hours
You have to figure that when the star s name is listed wrong in the opening credits you are not in for a good time the credit reads Cuba Gooding J R Some nice car chase shoot em up blow em up action if ALL you want is action because the relationship to what plot exists is tenuous at best and completely unbelievable The motivations of the characters especially that of Gooding s at the end are worse then unbelievable they are irrational when they are not hopelessly muddled All I can think is that Andy Cheng must be a really nice guy to get this many good actors into this foul a project he can t have something on all of them can he
Camera work Why is the camera work in this movie so jumpy This is annoying and distracting Editing the Flashes of the still pictures were way too short Many of the other scenes were too short also Just flashes Sound the background music was way too loud and covered up the voices One should not have to rewind and replay to catch what was said Doesn t anybody check these things and make them do it over again Please reduce the volume of the background music in future Is adjustment of the relative sound levels the job of the editor Julia Wong The plot had way too many loose ends The basic story line had potential I think the film needed more work Was it rushed Perhaps they ran out of money Like a lot of movies it started out great but just petered out toward the end I really don t understand this you know you have the story board before it goes into production so why doesn t all the loose ends get taken care of in the storyboard br br Sorry to be so critical
I rented End Game having never heard of it but I m fond of political thrillers so I thought I d give it a shot After doing some research on the movie I found that it had initially been intended for theatrical release but instead had gone strait to DVD After seeing it I m thinking no wonder The movie is shocking in its unoriginality The plot and the characters are perfunctory I figured out whodunnit by the half way mark but the ending was a curve ball I have to say I didn t expect it to end quite the way it did but that s not a point in its favor The more predictable ending would have been preferable to one that is so bad Perhaps the film makers saw how predictable the film was and so they decided to throw in a twist even one that made the movie even worse br br Stay away I want the 5 98 and my 107 minutes back
This movie looked good good cast evergreen topic and an explosive opening It went downhill from there Why was it filmed by hand held camera It shakes judders part captures scenes and simply confuses the viewer A poor choice indeed As if this was not enough the worst edit in memory assumes a drugged viewer mandatory if you want to get any enjoyment from it at all And then it commits the worst sin of all After leading the viewer down all sorts of unlikely and implausible scenarios to the point of exhaustion they roll credits without revealing the denouement the ending the payoff like what the heck was the motive How can you expect to succeed by making thrillers without an ending Doh This movie had great promise and ending up doing a face plant in the mud What a waste of effort Poor effort by writer and director
I didn t expect a movie as good as In The Line of Fire or an episode of 24 but it looked like this movie was made for TV and did a mediocre job at best The good cast couldn t disguise the fact that the plot was all too predictable and actors had to struggle they really try their best I think through their lines of bad script giving their rather flat characters any extras When I watched the movie I got the feeling that I had seen most of this in other better movies In it you had car chases big shootouts romance plot twists etc etc This movie has none br br Spoiler As soon as you see another woman talking into the phone to Cuba s character you know who s behind all this and all the hints you re being given you stand too close to the president see it from my perspective sound silly br br If it were up to me and maybe it s a good thing that it isn t I would rewrite the plot like this br br First lady orders the murder of her husband because she is sick and tired of writing checks to Cuba all the time
SPOILERS AHEAD br br This is one of the worst movies ever made it s that simple There is not one redeeming quality about this movie The first 10 minutes are quite tricky they actually lead you to believe that this film will be shocking and will have you on the edge of your seat Instead you will spend 83 minutes punching yourself while watching stolen and poorly made scenes run without any organization The lake was ridiculous looked like an aquarium and had the same plant in different parts of the lake bed Characters show their advanced teleportation powers for example Alex Thomas who falls into the lake drunk and then ends up on his boat in an impossible position Angie Harmon put up a pitiful performance as Kate made worse by the space time continuum rupturing dialog that appears to have been written at the last minute by a fifth grader An example of this would be when she said Flashlight in such a stupid manner that it shows the threshold of how much a human body can cringe before it snaps in half Finally the editing of this movie was by far the most bizarre and horrific that I have ever seen It was like the cameramen were a bunch of chimps who had been given camcorders by scientists An example of this would be when we suddenly get a closeup of the headlight on Alex s car I would bet that there was little to no time spent editing this movie The ending was absolutely pathetic The writers were obviously trying to create some sort of mysterious plot line that made the viewer say oh yeah Instead we re left to view some dumb painting of a spider that somehow fits into the story line Unfortunately there is not one perspective in the millions out there that could save this movie from being a festering piece of crap br br I give this a 5 out of 10 the 5 being from the fact that this movie was recorded on film instead of becoming a picture book
How unfortunate to have so many of my a list and good b list actors agree to do this movie but they did and that is what sucked me into watching it I had never heard of this movie but there was Cuba Gooding Jr right on the DVD cover and James Woods in the background how bad can it be In a word Very This movie starts o k has some twists and turns then just lays an egg The ending was so weak it was as if the writer got called away and his 4 year old son sat down at the type writer and hacked out the ending How ironic a for a movie titled The end game to have such a poor one These are the types of movies that can move a list actors to the b list in hurry I hope Cuba Gooding JR and James Woods don t make a habit of this
So I m looking to rent a DVD and I come across this movie called End Game It stars James Woods and Cuba Gooding JR and has the synopsis of a taught political thriller Well worth a look then Or so I thought br br Boy was I wrong br br End Game has just about the most ridiculous plot I have ever had the displeasure of enduring Now being something of a whodunnit I can t really tear into it as I would like without ruining it for those who have yet to experience this monstrosity But questions such as Why has he she they done this and Where on earth did they get the resources to pull this off are all too abundant following the film s unintentionally hilarious conclusion br br As for the acting you know those films where you can almost feel that an actor s realised that they ve made a terrible mistake in signing on for a movie and this then shows in their performance This is one of those Accompany this with a laughable script and seriously flawed irritating direction and you have the recipe for cinematic poison br br Of course this didn t make it to the cinema and for the same reason you should not allow it into your living room it is appalling
Some guy gets whacked Right out in plain sight this other guy shoots him He s got some bodyguards and they whack the killer but a reporter gets interested She goes to the hospital where they took the guy who got whacked She walks in and corners one bodyguard but he doesn t feel like talking I can t figure out why It s not like anyone else is interested She s the only reporter there Anyway her editor discourages her from working on this lame story But hey she does anyway She goes to see the killer s sister mom A few minutes after she leaves they get whacked big time somebody blows up their trailer huge ball of fire Then she searches out the bodyguard from the hospital She finds him hungover on his boat but a minute later they re both underwater sucking on a scuba tank cause three guys are trying to whack them and have blown up the boat big time huge ball of fire The reporter and the bodyguard whack two of the guys who are trying to whack them br br In the course of the next hour another guy gets whacked crossing the street there s a shootout with several stiffs in a warehouse some car chases with wreckage death a fake suicide etc etc Lotsa stiffs all kindsa carnage br br Great stuff but what the reporter and the bodyguard can t figure is why in hell the original guy got whacked What s the motivation Of course it might help us to figure out why the reporter s even interested Through almost all of this she s the only reporter on the story Nobody else in the media cares Not even with all the big fireballs and dead bodies True the original guy who got whacked wasn t exactly a celebrity His job was a little bit dull He was just the President Yeah the one who lives in the White House Oh and the bodyguard is a Secret Service agent br br Is that the spoiler br br It should be After all there are no TV cameras no other print reporters no bloggers just another one of those police blotter crimes br br So what s the spoiler br br Lemme think br br No Wait The spoiler is that his wife did it Yeah the First Lady She was p ed because the President was fooling around And she gets away with it She s really sharp huh But how the hell could anybody ever figure that out Why would anyone bother After all only one reporter is even interested br br I give this move a 1 It was so dumb I just had to keep watching And it only got dumber That s the real spoiler But even though I ve told you you ve got to see it to believe it
This movie was craptacular I was so emotionally uninvolved in every single character that the movies biggest antagonist was in fact myself I played it beautifully throughout promising myself I would walk away but only drinking another beer hoping it would auto magically transform into something engrossing along the way Even in this state I couldn t help but notice that Cuba s acting was as flimsy as tracing paper His obsessive dedication to his job was unconvincingly done as well as his one night binge after the failure of his own idiot standards Burt came on the screen as a General that s right a General who wears too much makeup I fell into a frighteningly fast binge to rival Cuba s except mine was real and I stubbed my toe Recompense Recompense my stubbed toe
Predictable hackneyed poorly written Foolishly I reasoned such a prominent cast would not be involved unless it had merit I guess competition amongst actors is so intense these days and will only get worse that one cannot pick and choose much any more Early on we were given an inkling who was was instrumental in the assassination and we had it rammed down our throats ever since The movie lacked intrigue giving us little insight into the victim and only one possible motive for the murder Some of the discourse was frankly embarrassing It s hard to believe anyone would even consider let alone commit to the spending of tens of millions of dollars to make this tripe
Please help the economy spend your money elsewhere The synopsis of the movie is the First Lady has her husband assassinated because he was cheating on her That s it Undetected by anyone except Cuba and Angie she designs and implements a vast assassination conspiracy which no one knows about and gets away completely free br br Some specific points are particularly hilarious While standing in front of the president Cuba a deflects the assassin s bullet which then enters the back of the president s head br br Cuba and Angie watch film from a news camera and they see a clue They go to great lengths to protect the film believing that they are the only people that have a copy of this very public film br br Cuba speaks with a presidential staff member The PSM comments that there was no conspiracy Cuba claims there was more than one person involved The PSM then rants that the conspiracy includes the FBI the CIA and the NSA Gosh I wonder is the PSM is involved br br Ms Archer the First Lady is a craptacular artist Cuba can t make out a painting and she says You re too close stand back look from a different perspective look from my perspective Can anyone miss THAT clue
End Game started well the least said about the end the better it seemed like things we re happening just to keep the plot going for example the reporter who at first is a very inquisitive intelligent person half way through does something really stupid and totally out of character we are given no reason for this apart from the next scene wouldn t make sense without it The whole story could have been told in about 30 minutes it would have made an average TV political drama The brilliant Cuba Gooding Jr is very watchable however and James Woods does an admirable job considering br br The end game was honestly one of the worst films I ve ever seen and that s saying something I ve seen Gigli
I spent almost two hours watching a movie that I thought with all the good actors in it would be worth watching I couldn t believe it when the movie ended and I had absolutely no idea what had happened I was mad because I could have used that time doing something else I tried to figure it all out but really had no clue Thanks to those who figured it out and have explained it right or wrong it s better than not knowing anything Who was the lady in the movie with dark hair that we saw a couple of times driving away How did First Lady know that her husband was cheating on her At the end of the movie Kate said she would eventually find out the truth Does this mean that we re going to be subjected to End Game 2
Cuba Gooding Jr is a secret service agent who blames himself over the assassination of the U S President i ll point out straight away that this is not the type of role that this very talented actor is noted for and this film shows us why He teams up with a persistent news reporter Angie Harmon to uncover the conspiracy surrounding the president s death and so on blah blah blah br br Even with a cast of James Woods Cuba Gooding Jr Anne Archer and Angie Harmon End Game fails to grab your attention plain and simple some of the action is good the acting isn t all bad and the story although clichéd and done before could have lead to an entertaining and enjoyable movie WELL IT DOESN T The writing of the script and the direction makes absolutely sure of that at no point does it suck you into the story or make you give the slightest thought to any of the characters br br 4 10 It s Boring Predictable and Dull
i guess its possible that I ve seen worse movies but this one is a real stinker the plot is unremarkable but thats not the worst of it the directing is no where close to what you would expect from andy ching he s capable of good work but failed to pull this movie together br br angie harmon playing the female lead as a reporter dogging into who s behind the assassination of the president truly butchered the role there was no chemistry with gooding her demeanor was flat and wooden and the 5 inch spike heels she wore throughout the movie were absurd this outing for harmon places her solidly at the bottom of the b list br br and what was cuba gooding thinking he has to his credit a number of outstanding performances but this was far beneath what we ve come to expect from him br br poor james woods and burt reynolds poor poor poor poor poor
I argued with myself whether to rent this or not I m always afraid of renting something I ve never heard of don t remember this being in theaters Great cast that s what tipped the scales 30 minutes in I almost stopped watching it The first few minutes are fun to watch but unbelievable It only gets worse after that The writers of this movie could do a little research on future projects if they want to make their movies even a little better Or they could just try writing something just a little bit believable I give it a 3 a 1 for the writing only because there are words and a 2 for being able to get so many good actors to agree to do this movie despite having to read the script Oh my god this movie sucks
Poor Ingrid suffered and suffered once she went off to Italy tired of the Hollywood glamor treatment First it was suffering the torments of a volcanic island in STROMBOLI an arty failure that would have killed the career of a less resilient actress And now it s EUROPA 51 another tedious exercise in soggy sentiment br br Nor does the story do much for Alexander KNOX in another thankless role as her long suffering husband who tries to comfort her after the suicidal death of their young son At least this one has better production values and a more coherent script than STROMBOLI br br Bergman is still attractive here but moving toward a more matronly appearance as a rich society woman She s never able to cope over the sudden loss of her son despite attempts by a kindly male friend Sometimes I think I m going out of my mind she tells her husband A portentous statement in a film that is totally without humor or grace but it does give us a sense of where the story is going br br Bergman is soon motivated to help the poor in post war Rome but being a social worker with poor children doesn t improve her emotional health and from thereon the plot takes a turn for the worse br br The film s overall effect is that it s not sufficiently interesting to make into a project for a major star like Bergman The film loses pace midway through the story as Bergman becomes more and more distraught and her husband suspects that she s two timing him The story goes downhill from there after she nurses a street walker through her terminal illness The final thread of plot has her husband needing to place her for observation in a mental asylum br br Ingrid suffers nobly through it all over compensating for the loss of her son but it s no use Not one of her best flicks to put it mildly br br Trivia note If she wanted neo realism with mental illness she might have been better off accepting the lead in THE SNAKE PIT when it was offered to her by director Anatole Litvak It would have done more for her career than EUROPA 51 br br Summing up Another bleak indiscretion of Rossellini and Bergman
Maybe it s the dubbing or maybe it s the endless scenes of people crying moaning or otherwise carrying on but I found Europa 51 to be one of the most overwrought and therefore annoying films I ve ever seen The film starts out promisingly if familiarly as mom Ingrid Bergman is too busy to spend time with her spoiled brat of a son Sandro Franchina Whilst mummy and daddy bland Alexander Knox entertain their guests at a dinner party the youngster tries to kill himself setting in motion a life changing series of events that find Bergman spending time showering compassion on the poor and needy Spurred on by Communist newspaper editor Andrea Ettore Giannini she soon spends more time with the downtrodden than she does with her husband who soon locks her up in an insane asylum for her troubles Bergman plays the saint role to the hilt echoing her 1948 role as Joan of Arc and Rossellini does a fantastic job of lighting and filming her to best effect Unfortunately the script pounds its point home with ham fisted subtlety as Andrea and Mom take turns declaiming Marxist and Christian platitudes By the final tear soaked scene I had had more than my fill of these tiresome characters A real step down for Rossellini as he stepped away from neo realism and further embraced the mythical and mystical themes of 1950 s Flowers of St Francis
I checked this movie out based on a favorable review on this page It is slow moving and the payoff is a four star dud The only mystery here is how Oscar winner F Murray Abraham got involved with such a lousy script
Ok I have read about this film somewhere in the internet and many criticized on how bad and sucks this film was And I couldn t have been more agree about it Then after that I saw this film on DVD I was thinking twice about this and then came commercial of this film on TV Luckily I spared my money for this pieces of crap I was sacrificed my sleeps for this film and soon it turned out that this film couldn t make me satisfy So I can t be judging on how the film was made but anyway it still sucks As for those who liked this film I would apologize for flaming this film and telling on how sucks this film is I don t know what do YOU think about this film
On the surface this movie would appear to deal with the psychological process called individuation that is how to become a true self by embracing the so called dark side of human nature Thus we have the Darkling a classic shadowy devilish creature desperately seeking the company that is recognition of men and the story revolves around the various ways in which this need is handled more or less successfully br br However if we dig a little deeper we find that what this movie is actually about is how you should relate to your car like you would to any other person in the opening scene the main character male car mechanic fallen from grace is collecting bits and pieces from car wrecks with his daughter when a car wreck nearly smashes the little girl Lesson 1 Cars are persons embodied with immortal souls and stealing from car wrecks is identical with grave robbery The wicked have disturbed the dead and must be punished just after that another character Rubin buys a car wreck intending to repair it and sell it as a once lost now found famous race car and is warned by the salesman Lesson 2 Just like any other person a car has a unique identity that cannot be altered nor replaced In addition there is the twist that Rubin actually sees a hidden quality in what most people would just think of as junk but eventually that quality turns out to be a projection of Rubin s own personal greed for more profit Lesson 3 Thou shalt never treat thy car as a means only but always as an end in itself then we have the scene where the main character is introduced to Rubin and more importantly Rubin s car The main character s assessment of the car s qualities is not just based on its outer appearance but also by a thorough look inside the engine room Lesson 4 A car is not just to be judged by its looks it is what is inside that really counts There is punishment in store for those who do not keep this lesson in mind as we see in the scene where another man tries to sell Rubin a fake collector s car This scene by the way also underlines the importance of lesson 3 br br There are numerous other examples in the movie of the car person theme and I am too tired now to bother citing all of them but the point remains and I guess this is what I m really trying to say that this movie is fun to watch if you have absolutely nothing else to do or if you re a car devotee
First of all I thought it was naughty of them to say in the credits that the story and screenplay were by Preston Sturges Sturges was one of the better Hollywood screenwriters until his talent faded and he retired However it wasn t the Preston Sturges it was Preston Sturges Jr The story was essentially based on Robert Louis Stevenson s short story The Bottle Imp A good man comes into possession of an evil object that will grant him any wish but which will ultimately doom him to hell That s fine Nobody said screenwriters had to be original The actors are generally pretty competent given the mediocre writing that they had to translate onto the screen My biggest complaint comes with the ending The hero thinks he has discovered a way out of his dilemma but tries to solve the problem in a somewhat different way in an attempt to save an innocent person At first this seems to have worked but true to the code of the modern horror film they feel they have to provide one last dollop of horror at the very end of the film This is a stupid convention The older horror films got along just fine with allowing the hero to win out at the end There is nothing wrong with good triumphing over evil no matter what the current crop of film makers seems to think You can give the audience a good healthy scare and still make them feel happy at the end In fact I think it s preferable
The Darkling was a very interesting and entertaining film while F Murray Abraham was in it Spoilers About halfway through F Murray gets zapped because The Darkling is some kind of demon like creature who enjoys living vicariously He takes bums and losers and perverts them further while giving them all they want in terms of success He feeds from their enjoyment of the Seven Deadly Sins However part of it is that he needs to get people who may be flawed but not completely evil Otherwise he cannot pervert their natural goodness That s what the little guy said in his Barry White voice which I found both charming and amusing Mostly amusing Like imagine Barry White if he were a little dwarf and he was telling Aiden Gillen Dee Plane Dee Plane Bos Here eet come Dee Plane All through the movie Dee Dwarf actually a robotronic cherub talks to Aiden Gillen in the Barry White voice saying things like It s OK to be bad you know you want it Now you ve committed murder you re really moving up in the world and other remarks that sound like commercials for Being Evil Stores or something It really is hilarious in a sick way br br Anyhow Aiden Gillen is no F Murray Abraham and the movie tanks as soon as Murray gets the axe or knifed F Murray brings a certain happy malevolence to his role in this film He is a good actor Aiden Gillen on the other hand has a permanent happy smirk on his face and he looks like maybe his remedial English Comp class had never hit the Mythological Characters and he could not imagine what the movie was about The ENDING is really creepy and yet almost comical If this movie were a parody the ending was perfect If it was not a parody then it was creepy but a cheap use of a little girl to deliver a gross out that the movie itself could not deliver The people who made this movie lost whatever it was that they wanted to do with it somewhere before the ending It just ends like they just realized that they had run out of money and had to film a quickie ending
Yes I sat through the whole thing God knows why br br It was a long afternoon I had nothing to do it was bitterly cold outside okay those are all lame excuses but they re the only ones I have br br I gave The Darkling 4 stars out of a possible 10 I have seen worse films but this one definitely is right there in the old trash bin of bad filmdom poor script poor acting bad lighting and cheesy special effects br br The storyline which never completely makes sense revolves around this simple little family Daddy Mommy and little girl that I assume the viewer is supposed to be identifying with all three of them were tedious and annoying You just want the dark side to get every one of them br br Daddy is a cook whose hobby is cars Daddy meets a rich man named Rubin who collects cars and who is also in possession of a being he purchased in the mysterious Orient Rubin keeps it in a birdcage and refers to it as The Darkling br br During the course of the film the Darkling is explained as being about 3 or 4 different things a shadow without a person the inner darkness that exists in all of us and the Devil So take your pick of whichever one of those explanations suits your fancy because trust me it doesn t really matter br br The Darkling s main problem seems to be that it craves having a companion it gets a human companion and then eventually is dissatisfied with the human being This of course leads to immense wealth followed by disaster for the human who hooks up with The Darkling br br And for the rest of us it just leads to a very long tedious movie br br
The film is about Sir Christopher Strong MP member of Parliament played by Colin Clive and his affair with the Amelia Earhart like character played by Katherine Hepburn Up until they met he had been a very devoted husband but when he met the odd but fascinating Hepburn he couldn t help himself and they fell in love You can tell because they stare off into space a lot and talk ENDLESSLY about how painful their unrequited love is Frankly this is a terribly dated and practically impossible film to watch Part of the problem is that in the Pre Code days films glamorizing adultery were very common Plus even if you accept this morally suspect subject the utter sappiness of the dialog make it sound like a 19th century romance novel and a really bad one at that Sticky and with difficult to like characters after all Clive s wife is a nice lady and did no one any harm make this one a big waste of time About the only interesting aspect of this film is the costume Hepburn wears in an early scene where she is dressed in a moth costume You ve gotta see it to believe it and she looks like one of the Bugaloos an obscure but fitting reference
Merry madcaps in London stage a treasure hunt with one young woman inadvertently fixing up her married politician father with a strong independent lady flier who s never been in love Intriguing early vehicle for Katharine Hepburn playing an Amelia Earhart like aviatrix who s been too self involved to give herself over to any man The director Dorothy Arzner and the screenwriter Zoe Akins who adapted Gilbert Frankau s book were obviously assigned to this project to get the female point of view but why are all the old clichés kept intact like frozen artifacts Billie Burke plays the type of simpering weepy wife who takes to her bed when thing go wrong and Hepburn s final scene is another bummer A curious artifact but not a classic for Kate watchers from
Dialogue stilted clichéd Acting hammy clichéd Plot predictable clichéd br br Just what are Christopher Plummer Nastassia Kinski doing in this B rubbish Plummer was well established decades before this movie was made Kinski had masterpieces like Tess and Cat People behind her Must have been desperate br br The bad guys all have bad guy accents bad bad guy accents Plummer especially Where did he learn to do German and most of them have bad guy sneers as well The innocent bystanders all overdo their panicking enough to make you laugh The good guy survives amongst other things a 5 throwing knife buried hilt deep in his shoulder just pulls it out and seconds later is using the arm with no difficulty at all marines machine gun fire I think someone referred to a 50 in the leg which he sorts out by tying a bandage around his pants leg and thereafter he barely has a limp several fist fights in which he sustains multiple punches to the face as well as being run cranium first into a door frame a fall backwards from what looks like the third floor onto paving without the slightest sign of a twisted ankle or any other such trifling inconvenience The script has exactly 3 clever lines the rest of the time it s all so dull and boring br br OK it s not all bad Plummer does bring a certain class to his part and is undoubtedly the best actor in this flick Of course that doesn t say much but he can do the callous villain without resorting to the ham techniques most of the villains use here He delivers his Ve haff vays and meance type lines with some menace but you are always aware you are watching Christopher Plummer acting the villain br br This movie is truly an awful waste of time The acting such as it is is sort of 70 s 007 movies wooden line delivery meets Bruce Lee s very obviously faked fight scenes but it s not even anywhere near as good as either a Roger Moore 007 or a Bruce Lee film Don t bother
but Thomas Ian Griffith just doesn t have the polish that a big bucks actor has granted this was made 5 years ago Some of the humorous lines could have been timed to make this not only action but comedy And how do you get KC out of Katia Koslovska anyhow Plummer s character was so corny he would have fit better in a Bullwinkle toon Personally if action flicks are going to show skin I d have liked to have seen equal time between female male otherwise don t show any
It s Die Hard meets Cliffhanger when a ski resort is besieged by terrorists and it s up to one cop Jack Crackerjack to stop this br br A B action movie that borrows from other films and is quite good with pretty good action a ridiculous plot as always in these movies and three fine stars Thomas Ian Griffith as the cop and Nastasja Kinski and Christopher Plummer as terrorists If you don t like stupid B action movies this is not for you
Maverick cop with family problems and fondness of using his gun Check Isolated location with valuable object which is begging to be stolen Check Tasty looking love interest Check Assorted band of dumb cardboard cannon fodder villains with dodgy European accents Check German sounding bad guy played by an English actor with a piece of corny dialogue for every occasion Check Corny one liners Check br br Deary me does this film take the wee wee or what The clichés come as thick and fast as an avalanche and most of the cast just stand around gawping at just how bad the script is br br In a blatantly cheap and cheerful straight to video rip off of Die Hard only set on a mountain complete with some nicked lines from the aforesaid we have all the usual action move cliché s ticked off progressively as we go along with some good old fashioned violence and nudity thrown in to wake up anyone in the audience who may just have nodded off br br Jack Wild is the cop in full on John McClane mode here who even manages time for the ye ancient bad guy with gun has used all his bullets gag at one point br br In amidst this mess there are a few well known recognisable faces who I can only assume needed the cash and or were simply playing it for laughs right from the pointless opening scene that had nothing to do with the plot whatsoever through to the final implausible conclusion complete with ropey dialogue and even ropier effects br br Looking up this three quid from the Supermarket bargain bin effort on IMDb I am astonished to find that this dud spawned not one but two sequels I have got to find these gems on DVD It looks like the first sequel is a rip off of Under Siege 2 and the second sequel well goodness knows One thing that is always a bad sign is that the actor playing Jack changes with each film and even the character s name seems to change for the third instalment br br Still blind purchases of cheap DVD s just would not be the same if studios didn t keep trotting out material of this awful quality
Wow and I thought that any Steven Segal movie was bad Every time I thought that the movie couldn t get worse it proved me wrong The story was good but the actors couldn t carry it off Also they made a lot of mistakes on how proper archiological digs are done For instance you don t handle artifacts untill they are catologed and accounted for The biggest crime in casting was the archiologist girl She is a weak actress and I felt that her acting really made the movie less realistic then it already was The whole concept of the knights templar being underground all these years seemed pretty stupid to me I like the idea of how they disappeared and stuff so that almost seemed depressing I thought that the characters wern t explained well enough You didn t find out much background and that made it harder to relate to them
Where to start This is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen The editing is the worst ever the sound effects were awful and the sound editing was whacked Most of the movie all one could here is the crappy kicking effects with muddled talking in the background I had to turn my volume on full blast just to her what was going on and what was I supposed to hear exactly Probably one of the worst scripts ever made I can t believe people actually put up some green for this film It makes me think I could take a crap in a box send it to producers and then have them finance a movie for me br br Dolph was a usual Dolph Nothing else needs to be said The villains were bad the protagonists were bad and the movie was a stinker If you really want to know what NOT to do when either writing directing or editing a movie watch this
This movie had the potential to be really good considering some of the plot elements are borrowed from the sci fi actioner THE HIDDEN And Dolph always lends some cheesy appeal to his roles But someone somewhere really dropped the ball on this one br br Dolph plays a butt kicking monk who travels to New York to retrieve a key that unlocks a door beneath his monastery that has imprisoned the antichrist for 2000 years He must battle the minion who is a spirit that jumps from body to body much like THE HIDDEN and JASON GOES TO HELL The minion naturally wants the key so it can let the antichrist out Along for the ride is an annoying female archaeologist and together she and Dolph are chased by the minion possessed bodies br br If I m making this sound entertaining forget it The pacing is very awkward and sluggish the acting subpar at best and the fight scenes staged poorly Dolph sleepwalks through his role and spouts some of the worst dialogue of his career br br The cheese factor really picks up at the end when the minion battles an army of machine gun wielding monks at the monastery but the rest of this flick is a snoozefest br br Too bad I really wanted to like this
I can t think of much to say about this film br br This was an awful movie I can t even tell you what made me decide to view it It had SO few redeeming qualities that I don t even know where to begin br br The plot moved from implausible to downright absurd My entire body was tense throughout the duration of the movie because I could not wait for the awful thing to be over and done By the end of the movie I found myself feeling beyond relieved br br The editing was poor the acting was sub par and the storyline was weak Francoise Robinson was cast as a Native American even though she does not even closely resemble someone of Native American heritage br br If a movie is going to be this idiotic it should be laughably stupid at the very least It wasn t It was just pathetic
Dolph Lundgren stars as a templar who comes to New York when a key that unlocks the anti Christ is found by an archaeologist of course the demon is only a couple miles behind Dolph and isn t killed so easily as he transfers from body to body Like Fallen without the suspense Of course Lundgren is out of his element and the movie is completely unwatchable I admit to being a fan of Dolph Lundgren like Steven Seagal and Jean Claude Van Damme I try to watch his movies whenever they re on TV I caught The Minion and boy was I ever disappointed This movie is utterly terrible With action sequences so poorly staged and badly edited you can barely make coherent sense in the fight arena Worst of all is Lundgren s woefully unconvincing perf as a tough guy priest all of this made worse that the movie is such a rip off of Fallen Which was good and End Of Days Which was bad but better than this overall this movie is the worst movie I ve seen from Dolph Lundgren It literally has nothing to recommend it It s awful and it s the lowest point in Lundgren s career And I saw Cover Up The Last Warrior and Masters Of The Universe br br 1 2 Out Of 4 Awful
The Minion is about well a minion A servant of Satan and whose goal is to get the key that will unlock the door where his master is trapped He is some sort of demon who possess human beings and when the body dies will possess another Anyone who happens to be possessed will go on some berserker rage Dolph Lundgren plays Lukas a member of a secret order of Templars who is tasked to keep the key away from the minion The movie begins a thousand years ago in the Middle East where a couple of knight templars flee from the minion Then flash forward to 1999 where the key winds up somewhere underground in New York An archeologist is assigned to study dig the place where the key was found Needless to say the minion is after the key and the movie becomes a long winded chase scene between the minion and Lukas and archeologist br br The movie is just that a low budget B movie flick The movie lacks energy and just trods along You ll follow the chase but you won t ever feel involved in the story which willfully takes ideas from previous movies especially The Terminator films The fight scenes with the minion is troublesome in that you never get the sense of how good or how bad a warrior this demon is It skillfully becomes a one man army when fighting a squad of templars but sucks when it comes to one on one And it s supposed to be around for a long time All this goes to show that any sense of logic is just thrown down the drain for convenience The whole idea of a secret order of Templars a door to hell and the key isn t well explained We are merely to accept that they just exist The movie seems to have been made with the feeling there s not much potential to the story but only enough to make a few bucks Dolph Lundgren sure looks like he wish he were somewhere else br br The verdict 2 of 5 stars
This is without a doubt one of the worst movies EVER I emphasize EVER made What s worse my old hero Dolph is in it and he s starring it Jesus The story is actually quite good but the way it s carried out made even my body hurt The fighting scenes for starters are about as well choreographed as a fight between two drunks slugging it out in the gutter The actors except for Dolph who kinda sucks also perform so badly you can t help but wonder if their reason for being there is that they re all friends of the director who by the way must have been absent most if not all of the time This is 12 million spent in an unimaginable way because by the look of the effects and scenery the cost can t be a cent above 1000
Come on let s get real The Knights of Christ Ordo Templi or the Knights Templar as they are more commonly called did not even exist until the early 12th century The story is so laughable that it s pathetic Dolph Lundgren just looked positively bored And besides if you wanted to have a real life Templar why not just use the Knights of Christ who are still in existence in Portugal At least they should have taken history into account The only redeeming quality I could find in this movie was that the artifacts looked authentic enough to pass for medieval or Gothic period pieces The acting was bad the storyline appalling the action horrible and the props were okay
For two of the funniest comedians the movie was awful Fast forwarded it and never got any better Waste of time and waste of money Tina Fey is such a great writer I thought that she would be so great in the comedy The previews were so great but they only showed the best parts of the movie My husband even thought that for a chick flick it sucked What is up with that Movie was very slow ans boring I will not recommend it to anyone at this time I would like my money back for this one BOO from us here in Arizona Thanks but no thanks Who does this kind of stupid stuff to make people think that you are pregnant I thought that it was going to be so funny I have had my own children and I have helped others have children It could have been more along the lines of reality
What happened What we have here is basically a solid and plausible premise and with a decent and talented cast but somewhere the movie loses it Actually it never really got going There was a little excitement when we find out that Angie is not really pregnant then find out that she is after all but that was it Steve Martin who is a very talented person and usually brings a lot to a movie was dreadful and his entire character was not even close to being important to this movie other than to make it longer I really would have liked to see more interactions between the main characters Kate and Angie and maybe try not for a pure comedy which unfortunately it was not but maybe a drama with comedic elements I think if the movie did this it could have been very funny since both actresses are quite funny in their own ways and sitting here I can think of numerous scenarios that would have been a riot
Near the closing stages of Baby Mama one of the central characters goes on to describe the basic outline of everything that came before and summarises that it was all just a mess I really couldn t say it any better than that And while the feature does have its odd ray of hope every now and again the vast majority of what is present is too neutered to be considered relevant and too unremarkable to be worth anyone s time A lacklustre cast mundane script and vague caricature characters ensure that Baby Mama certainly isn t taxing on the ol noggin but it never makes up for this through its proposed sense of humour Consisting mainly of very routine cliché jokes based around an odd couple rich and poor trying to live with each other as they prepare to bring a baby into the world the film is far too esoteric to deliver laughs outside its very thin demographic br br As a story on finding love it s not that bad but playing this plot line as a side story of sorts to work alongside the comedy orientated odd couple tangent characterisation is notably weak resulting in a lukewarm romance that never bubbles As characters themselves both central figures are mildly amusing when put together in small spaces but when left alone quickly unravel and bare their emptiness so while we may eventually come to find the character s interactions with each other amusing at times the comedy never branches beyond distant chuckles we don t feel for the characters and don t find them inherently interesting but rather their dynamic Unfortunately however although this dynamic works best or at least better than the individual personas as mentioned above it rarely stems outside of the typical confines of the odd couple formula br br Kate Tina Fey is a successful business woman who has hired working class dumb blonde Angie Amy Poehler to be her unlikely surrogate and after Angie decides to leave hopeless husband Carl Dax Shepard both eventually have to learn to live together despite their obvious differences Yes it s the typical odd couple premise and one that we have already seen in this year s What Happens in Vegas yet what Baby Mama lacks that the aforementioned movie had is both chemistry between performers and semi layered characters Kate and Angie both fail to ever show much of a personality outside of their two dimensional outline and as such both performers are neglected to play out roles that demand chemistry to produce out of thin air In fact the movie s only real engaging performance and character comes from the underused talents of Romany Malco who gets lumbered with playing a door man Of the few times that I laughed during Baby Mama most of those moments were because of this man and the remainder usually fell to Shepard br br It s a rare thing of course to find a movie which embodies its script s themes in the way which its world is shot and presented to us through the camera and yet director Michael McCullers goes from page to screen effectively enough Yet for a film about babies multi million dollar business and cultural stereotyping this isn t necessarily a good thing Baby Mama is grade A hammy plastic tinsel town with capital bore topped with sugar So not only did I feel emotionally distant to the characters because of their two dimensional nature but I simply didn t care for the world they inhabited The dialogue along with sets costumes and the script s general themes are painted in pastel blues and pinks so much that all shades of humanity are lost in the director s incessant need to make his movie feel like a neutered fantasy these aren t characters and that isn t our world in any way so why should I care At the end of the day however a romantic comedy s ultimate gauge of success or failure comes down purely to its chemistry between its love interests and the frequency of its laughs Baby Mama has little going on in any of these departments Of course to say that the film is without any value at all would be unfair I m sure female audiences in a similar boat as lead character Kate may get a slight kick out of the proceedings but anyone else will probably just feel numb and probably bored In this respect Baby Mama avoids being unbearable but never convinces in being anything remarkable or worthy of a look to anyone outside of its immediate audience a comedic dud and a romantic mismatch Baby Mama is too light headed to be interesting and too shallow to be entertaining br br A review by Jamie Robert Ward http www invocus net
I give this a generous four out of ten stars or dots or markers or something br br There were a grand total of two really really funny scenes in this movie All the scenes with Amy P and Tina Fey and Greg Kinnear Greg Kinnear moved along agreeably enough br br Otherwise the usual trafficking in stereotypes blazing speed rudely pushed along by a stupid soundtrack and soundtrack is generous br br Anyway the two really really funny scenes involved Amy P She s just really hilarious in an animal kind of way She s a mixture of that ape man skit that they do on SNL and Lucille Ball br br I hope they Amy P and Tina Fey just flat out admitted they did this for the money because if by doing it it gave birth to the Sarah Palin parodies then I guess we can say yeah it was worth it to put the black guy back into the servant man role who s really there to help you be more human br br Blah 4 outta 10 like I said is generous br br But no more girls OK Oh I almost forgot The mom from Two and a Half Men is in this movie and she s had some kind of plastic surgery so that her mouth now looks like the mouth of a 30 year old so every scene she s in I m like trying to rearrange her face or put it together in my mind or just answer the question No Wait Wait HAS she had plastic surgery Because as a viewer you really don t want her to have had plastic surgery
Come on Tina Fey you can do better then this As soon as the movie started i knew how it would end Sure it was funny at times Even laugh out loud funny But there isn t enough laughs to save this movie I don t recommend buying this At the most i recommend renting it but thats all Baby Mama has some funny scenes but is predictable and fails to have the heartwarming ending it strives for br br Tina Fey and Amy Poalher made a good team Mean Girls is one of my favorite movies Tina Fey and Amy Poalher both did great in that and they do good in this But this isn t there best Baby Mama had a great supporting cast Dane Cook Sigourney Weaver and Steve Martin add to the casts greatness br br Another pregnancy movie has hit the cinema world After the great Knocked Up and Juno Baby Mama looks very average when compared Knocked Up and Juno are Hilarious Heartwarming and have endings that leave you with a smile on your face Baby Mama s ending was unfunny and dull br br Baby Mama wasn t the best comedy of the year and it doesn t try to be I recommend it but don t expect it to be totally hilarious Expect a average comedy that doesn t give the big emotional ending it tries to have I give Baby Mama br br 4 10
I wouldn t say this totally sucked but if it wasn t for Netflix I wouldn t even have this in my house Steve Martin s eccentric president of a chain of health food stores falls flat He s just not funny He s another in a LONG slew of SNL rejects that can only find work whoring themselves to the next SNL movie The birthing coach with the Elmer Fudd lisp is about as funny as it is original Amy Poehler simply goes through the same motions she would for a 7 minute SNL skit which is about as funny as SNL lately The only thing going for this movie is that Tina Fey is easy on the eyes The ending was predictable as soon as you heard her character couldn t get pregnant The subject matter could have opened up to other comedic attempts but it seems to simple simmer along not really entertaining or creating laughs
I saw this movie last weekend and it is silly and mindless An ancient curse turns a man into a mummy in his pajamas The victims are scared senseless and can not run from a slow moving old man They drop their torches and shiver instead of attempting to ward him off or duh burn him Quentin alias Mr Fabersham of the Honeymooners is married to Diane Brewster alias Miss Canfield of Leave it to Beaver fame who is unhappy in marriage Wow love plot The rest of the cast just follows each other in the tombs and wait for screams to react and run to their aid The Egyptian girl is not bad looking but does not lend much to the film Where is the mummy Really just a curse unleashed This does not hold a torch to Universal Mummy films in the least Watch this movie if you need sleep because you will dose off

The soul of an ancient mummy is transferred to one of his followers so that he might punish everyone involved in the desecration of his tomb The soul transference makes the young man age at a tremendous pace until he himself resembles a mummy One by one the blood is drained from those involved in the dig br br To be as brief as possible Pharaoh s Curse is quite the lackluster affair While the movie does present a few good original ideas blood sucking mummy s soul transference interesting make up effects the arm ripping scene etc and a few atmospheric moments the direction and pace are the very definition of plodding To make matters even worse the first 15 of the film s relatively short 66 minute runtime consist of nothing much more than padding I usually go for these slow moving mummy movies but Pharaoh s Curse tests even my patients The cast helps very little With only one exception Ziva Rodann is the lone bright spot wish the movie could have focused more on her mysterious character the cast is as dull as the screenplay Finally I don t know whose idea it was to put the mummy looking servant in what appears to be pajamas but it s a laughable ridiculous look for a creature that supposed to instill fear in the audience br br Despite my mostly negative comments on the Pharaoh s Curse I m going to rate it a 4 10 Not a good rating to be sure but generous given all the problems I have with the movie
this is the perfect example of something great going awfully bad hence can i advice anyone to watch it well i was kinda obliged by the fact that in was in the tiff competition i still can t believe it won and i only remained until the end because the director was there for a q a section but that was also anything but interesting what s it about well the first half the worth watching one presents three characters a hooker a musician and some kind of official the first two lie about their professions but the third is the actual liar the second half do something else don t ruin a good evening includes some old breasts and heavy drinking but maybe you will see it completely different the tiff jury did were they drinking vodka
As much as I dislike saying me too in response to other comments it s completely true that the first 30 minutes of this film have nothing whatsoever to do with the endless dirge that comprises the following 90 br br Having been banned somewhere doesn t make a film watchable Just because it doesn t resemble a Hollywood product does not make it credible br br Worse yet in addition to no discernible plot other than there are lots of muddy places in Russia and many people even very old women drink lots of vodka a number of visuals are so unnecessarily nauseating I m in to my second package of Rolaids br br As for spoilers well the film is so devoid of any narrative thread I couldn t write one if I tried br br Don t waste your time or money and don t confuse this with good Russian cinema
I agree with the previous comment the beginning of the movie is quite good and get s you wandering about what is to come Which is nothing All open story lines remain open two characters who at first seemed like they might be of some importance are completely left out of the picture save for 1 or 2 very short scenes I wander if Ilya wouldn t have done better to just completely leave them out As for the one remaining character nothing is done with her either She just visits some god awful place and suddenly the movie isn t about her anymore but about some geriatric witches who spend their days making dolls out of bread drinking homemade vodka and apparently flashing each other Some may say the movie does well in showing a society crumbling like the judges of the IFFR but for me it is just bad taste bad camera work a lousy script and frightfully bad direction Therefor I can not be as generous as my predecessor when it comes to grading 1
The film is worth watching only if you stop it after half an hour It starts of with funny conversations in a bar and makes one expect a good funny story is to come Well I can tell you it will not come It will deteriorate in minutes into a movie that challenges your patience as well as your feelings of shame for the actors to an extend you will probably not be pleased to witness br br In an interview I heard that the director wanted to express in this film the feeling of a loss of identity that according to him the majority of the people in this globalizing world experience I was amazed to hear that Am I living in the same world he lives in OK a lot of people do walk around in the same clothes as mine and listen to the same music and all but that doesn t make me feel like I am losing my identity What does Khrzhanosvky think that we are not more than the clothes we wear and the movies we watch Am I shortsighted or is he br br Well my vote the good start of the movie saves it from getting a 1 a decent 4 is my conclusion
The worst movie I have seen in quite a while Interesting first half with some engaging terse dialogue among dubious characters in a late night bar The movie then degenerates into a shapeless succession of scenes aiming for visual shock read disgust without any redeeming observations or lessons in humanity or anything else br br I wanted to walk out but the director was present at this showing and my politeness preventing me from showing him disrespect Still time is precious as the director himself observed in his intro and I really begrudge the time I wasted on the second half of this one br br Saving graces were the three main characters in the first half of the movie especially the female lead
Let me start by saying that I consider myself to be one of the more most open minded movie viewers Movies are my passion and I am a big regular at my local cult movie rental place I also feel the need to add that they often ask ME for advice about movies whenever I get there and i never seem to be able to leave the place without having had an elaborate discussion or exchange of ideas about what is going on in the cult movie area I love to rent strange stuff and that is exactly why this movie was recommended by one of the guys at the cult movie video place He told me he thought I had to see this and since the cover said something about it being a movie with a Jodorowsky one of my favorites atmosphere I rented it br br The vote I gave here is not really fair because I did not think it was awful I just did not know how to rate it otherwise A question mark would have been more appropriate br br This is the first and only film that literally made me sick to my stomach I actually felt physically ill Am I the only one whose stomach literally turned Still I did not want to turn it off or maybe I just couldn t because I was fascinated in a nasty way br br I do not ever wanna see this movie again br br Not awful a 1 as I said Just not my cup of tea or wodka for that matter
Film starts with 3 people meeting each other in the bar OK They re talking about their imaginary lives lying all the time with no reason Still OK From time to time they even make you laugh Interesting First 30 minutes you actually enjoy it But then things become worse Nothing s happening for a long time and then when something happen all you can see are naked old ladies touching each other Not OK Disgusting By the way this part should be the top of the movie but it s everything except that Movie has no point it s boring and sick br br The strangest thing is that here Belgrade Serbia on FEST film festival this movie was the most popular according to researches of course before people watched it I even thought before watching Hay this might be interesting although it s a Russian movie But God No
The movie is basically the story of a Russian prostitute s return to her home village for the funeral of a sister friend There are a couple of other minor story lines that might actually be more interesting than the one taken but they are not fully explored The core of the movie is the funeral wake and later controversy over the future of a community of crones that make dolls and sell them to buy vodka but are now missing the artist who made their dolls marketable Apparently the movie is unedited The prostitute s journey from the city to the village is an excruciatingly endless train ride and tramp through the mud Maybe that s supposed to impress us with the immensity of the Russian landscape The village itself such as it is is inhabited by a legion of widows and one male the consort of the dead girl Continuing the doll business is problematic for everyone involved and eventually seems impossible Most of the film is shot with a hand held camera that could induce nausea Another problem for Western viewers is that subtitles don t include the songs and laments of the crones Don t go to this movie unless you re fluent in Russian
The Russian movie 4 follows the lives of three not four strangers who meet one night in a local bar One is a musician one a frozen meat seller and one a call girl br br 4 I gather is intended to showcase the dreariness and hopelessness of life in post Soviet Russia the characters have to make up stories to make their lives appear more interesting than they really are but the movie is so incoherent and boring that I seriously doubt very many people will be able to sit all the way through it There seems to be a suggestion running through the film that the shadowy Russian government is up to some shady doings behind the scenes operating secret cloning facilities selling decades old frozen meat etc but the movie is so formless and incomprehensible that I doubt anyone could figure out what anybody s really up to here br br Despite decent acting and a few incisively directed scenes 4 is a two hour long endurance contest that should be avoided at all costs
I m starting to think that there s a conspiracy all right one that involves a wallop of money paid to those who have access to published columns in newspapers and film and art magazines to ensure that this or that film despite its obscurity will reach a higher status via a ratings point which will tag it with a universal acclaim or something within that range thus ensuring unsuspecting folk like me will wander into theatres or rent the bloody thing expecting a surprise only to find myself racing to the bathroom to upchuck br br This movie is one of them It has definitely make me bypass any and every posted article I come across because it s rather clear that two things might have happened either I didn t get the message that is so hidden beneath this film s inner realms as to be impossible to access or they and I watched two entirely different movies that happen to share the same name 4 is a dirty trick on the audience It s no wonder that it appeared and disappeared faster than you can say smorsgabord and that despite the rating it got on Metacritic no one had heard of it It s terrible with sugar on top br br Firstly there is the ever present number four from start to finish While having a little symbolism here and there is okay and it s been done with various degrees of success in many well known movies this movie is panting with it Four dogs at the start of the movie looking at the camera in a heretofore empty street when suddenly machinery drops onto the foreground and proceeds to rip open the asphalt Four people in a bar although one of them is a non entity Three of them go their separate ways but are linked nevertheless not only to each other but to what their lives are not While this concept may work the movie meanders so much particularly with the story of the would be model played by Marina Vovchenko which goes into the territory of the extremely bizarre and not in a good way that the initial theme gets lost in translation Or maybe like I said before I just didn t get it The problem also lies in that so much time is spent on Marina s story which revolves on the death of her sister from bread chewing no less and the subsequent shrill mourning which follows that any interest in the inherent Surrealism dissipates without a trace So what if the same horrifying tales that the three strangers interchanged in a bar seem to have a truth of their own The director doesn t invest much time in truly tying them together or weaving a tighter story that could in a David Lynchian way intersect either with the past present or within alternate dimensions or even as a straightforward mundane science fiction story This is an uphill battle against an insurmountable wall that only a saint or someone into the weird for weird s sake could endure
I have yet to read a negative professional review of this movie I guess I must have missed something The beginning is intriguing the three main characters meet late at night in an otherwise empty bar and entertain each other with invented stories That s the best part After the three go their separate ways the film splits into three threads That s when boredom sets in Certainly the thread with the Felliniesque babushkas who make dolls out of chewed bread is at first an eye opening curiosity Unfortunately the director beat this one to death even injecting a wild plot line that leads nowhere in particular Bottom line a two hour plot thin listlessness If you suffer from insomnia view it in bed and you will have a good night sleep
Perhaps being a former Moscovite myself and having an elastic sense of humor prevents me from tossing this movie into the arthouse festival crap trashcan It s not the greatest film of 2005 nor is it complete garbage It just has a lot of problems I also sincerely doubt this movie was banned due to any ideological fears or conservative taboos or any other reason this movie might conversely be called courageous and uncompromising abroad It was banned because the censors knew 99 of the Russian film goers would find it offensive because of the bad taste exercised during the shooting and editing of this otherwise dull film br br So we have a strong opening shot Wonderful sound design excellent premise laden with meaning and symbolism The usage and placement of symbols will consistently be of the film s strongest aspects not that the number 4 is a daunting visual challenge Over the next 40 minutes we have an equally strong setup An amusing and well written bar conversation among the 3 main characters and we feel pathos for these people the great country of Russia the human condition and all that Then the movie starts slowing down We begin to wonder what yawn lies ahead br br The rest is quite boring simply put Sure the guy in the village tugs the heartstrings and there are some slightly amusing moments Nice sound sure But the enjoyment of this movie not to mention the plot are seriously compromised by the pacing problems And this this lack of a payoff for sitting through all the nicely shot abject misery and bleakness is what ultimately will make people angry at the offensive stuff personally the main offensive scene bordered on being endearing in that pathetic way harmless drunks can appear br br If you want to watch an enjoyable movie where Russians get wasted for prolonged periods of time the entire film watch Particulars of the National Hunt Much more rewarding post Soviet stuff So yeah a 4 out of 10 for 4 nice and symbolic of my post mediocre film condition
The movie starts quite with an intriguing scene three people are drinking and making small talk in a bar All of them are making up a bit outrageous stories As the movie unfolds it turns out that the most outrageous story is true However beyond that the movie is not very interesting except for the scene in the bar and the scene where main secret is revealed This revelation happens barely half time into the movie and frankly not much is left to be seen The rest of the time director is lingering in a god forsaken Russian village full of pitiful and creepy old ladies Sure these are fascinating and a bit shocking images but admiring them goes on way too long sacrificing any possible plot or character development I found this movie as another example of either lousy or lazy movie making where instead of trying to make an interesting story movie makers concentrate on weirdly fascinating imagery and through in a few almost unrelated stories case in point meat trader s story to leave the spectator to figure out all odds and ends On a surface it has artsy appearance but in this particular case is nothing more than lack of talent
I saw the film at the Belgrade Film Festival last week and I m still working off the trauma Essentially my view seems to match a number of others the first half hour was fresh sharp deep entertaining and promising Well acted too Natural My problem however is not simply with the fact that the final hour and a half of the film have nothing to do with the likable beginning nor the fact that I spent most of this time convulsing in agony at sharp grating industrial sounds and squinting at drunken toothless bread chewing hags It s rather with the fact that THEY NEVER WARNED ME The festival brochure synopsis described only the utterly intriguing sounding first half hour a whore piano tuner and meat seller chat in a bar pretending to be an advertising agent genetic engineer and petty government administration official respectively making no mention whatsoever of the never ending gum smacking to come Serves me right for not reading the reviews you might say but to my defense a number of reviews I looked at post fact um didn t at all stress the immensity and utter unbearableness of the greater part of the film br br The first hint should have been the introductory words by the director a bashful tousle haired Russian youth who stepped in front of the crammed auditorium the film seems to be doing incredibly well critically and tickets were sold out well in advance of the screening though most of the audience seemed as unaware as I was of the pain to come judging by the plethora of unearthly moans and groans that utterly permeated the theatre during the last half hour and many exasperated comments on exit to say the following Well I um thank you very much for coming to see this film and I just wanted to say well it s a very long film it took me four years to make it and it s I suggest that you see it and immediately try to forget about it It is very long Thank you for coming This is what he said Alarm bells should have been ringing What s he talking about I thought in happy confusion This is gonna be fun Of course by the time his strangely apologetic comments started making sense to me it was far too late to get out All I could do is writhe in increasing agony until the lights came on again And in the end I can t say I feel in any way improved by the experience Yes I absolutely loved the first half hour It was intelligent new and had a lot to say And yes Russia is probably in a bad state Yes every society has many hidden faces Yes toothless life in barren wastelands is probably unimaginably hard Yes yes yes I get all of this Really I do But I see no earthly reason why art and meaning should be so agonisingly drawn out and so painful to bear If you want to see a film land somewhere between the extremes of glitzy Hollywood plastic fantastic and hours of muddy vodka swigging try the Korean Chinese Bin Jip 3 Iron It s artsy and surprising but also to the point and fun
This was a blind buy used DVD It totally killed a nice buzz I had going when I hit play br br It s bubble headed comedy but it s um squalid The plot is ZANY but the characters do things to each other that are so petty and disturbed and conveniently contrived I ultimately found it depressing to watch br br Maybe the box lead me to expect something more than an uneven goofy caper film I know I know the quotes on the box the Academy Award nomination mean nothing
Iedereen Beroemd has everything we can expect from a straight to video movie It s the story about a man who believes his daughter could be a star The only thing he needs is to get her on stage surrounded by cameras and reporters A simple plan for which he has to kidnap and do some blackmail The problem with the movie is not the basic plot but how it is made Everything is supposed to be funny but it isn t It is trivial and clumsy the characters are shallow and the end sequence is totally without climax or emotion The last sequence is probably the only scene where you feel like laughing but only at how pathetic the whole set up is
This movie starts out with a certain amount of promise but in my view begins to lose it when the protagonist kidnaps the good Samaritan who comes to his aid when his car breaks down That this well meaning stranger begins to fix his car while he is away making a phone call is implausible enough but that she is one of the few people in the country who can help him put his family s life back on track is the type of coincidence beginning writers are warned against using in their stories br br I found this movie average at best Art direction could have been much better as could have been cinematography The acting was good and so was Eva van der Gucht s singing
MABEL AT THE WHEEL is one of those movies with a behind the scenes story that s more interesting than the movie itself This was Chaplin s tenth comedy for Keystone during his year of apprenticeship and his first two reeler Here he played one of his last out and out villain roles although the feature length TILLIE S PUNCTURED ROMANCE was yet to come and it also marked one of the last times he would work for a director other than himself In fact Chaplin s conflicts with director and co star Mabel Normand almost got him fired from the studio br br Chaplin hadn t gotten along with his earlier directors Henry Lehrman and George Nichols but according to his autobiography having to take direction from a mere girl was the last straw Charlie and Mabel argued bitterly during the making of this film Chaplin was still a newcomer at Keystone and his colleagues didn t know what to make of him but everyone loved Mabel Producer Mack Sennett was on the verge of firing Chaplin when he learned that the newcomer s films were catching on and exhibitors wanted more of them A S A P so Chaplin was promised the chance to direct himself in return for finishing this movie the way Mabel wanted it br br Unfortunately none of that drama is visible on screen in MABEL AT THE WHEEL which looks like typical Keystone chaos The story concerns an auto race in which Mabel s beau Harry McCoy is scheduled to compete but wicked Charlie and his henchmen abduct the lad and Mabel must take the wheel in his place For all the racing around brick hurling and finger biting the film is frankly short on laughs but there are a few points of interest There s some good cinematography and editing in the race sequence though there aren t really any gags just lots of frantic activity Chaplin himself looks odd sporting a goat like beard on his chin and wearing the top hat and frock coat he wore in his very first film appearance MAKING A LIVING but the outfit suits the old fashioned villainy he displays throughout At least it s novel to watch him play such an uncharacteristic role Visible in the stands at the race track are such Keystone stalwarts as Chester Conklin Edgar Kennedy in a strangely dandified get up and a more characteristic Mack Sennett spitting tobacco and doing his usual mindless rube routine As a performer Sennett was about as subtle as the movies he produced but you have to give the guy credit he knew what people liked These films were hugely popular in their day Mack s performance doesn t add much to MABEL AT THE WHEEL but he probably had to be on hand for the filming of this one to make sure his stars didn t kill each other
i tried to sit through this bomb not too long ago what a disaster the acting was atrocious there were some absolutely pathetic action scenes that fell flat as a lead balloon this was mainly due to the fact that the reactions of the actors just didn t ring true supposedly a modern reworking of the Hitchcock original Lifeboat i think Hictcock would be spinning circles in his grave at the very thought of it from what i was able to suffer through there is nothing compelling in this movie it boasts a few semi big names but they put no effort into their characters but you know to be fair it was nobody s fault really i mean i m pretty sure the script blew up in the first explosion LOL it is possible that this thing ends up improving as it goes along but for me i m not willing to spend at least three days to find out so unless you have at least a three day weekend on the horizon avoid this stinker 1 10
This film is really bad with a script full of memorable lines and incredibly bad performances The special effects are also bad not the worst ones I have seen either and the music is so bad that you have to listen to it to believe it Just two short themes 30 seconds long or so are repeated constantly throughout the whole film br br All in all one of the worst films I have ever seen
In the first one it was mainly giant rats but there were some wasps and a giant chicken too This one however is just giant rats period well giant rats and one really growing little boy This one is about this growing boy and a scientist that is trying to help him so he accidentally creates giant killer rats you know how it is This movie has some kills and its moments but I find it to be on par with the original I just prefer some variety in my giant creature movies Well that is not true I actually like Empire of the Ants maybe I just do not care for giant rodents All in all a rather drab movie though it does have one rather odd turn of events in this one dream sequence that is truly bizarre I just can t recommend this one
Boring predictable by the numbers horror outing at least has pretty good special effects and plenty of mindless mayhem and gore to satisfy mindless genre fans Mostly it s about giant rats chomping on a set of characters we don t care an iota about if that s your thing tune in 1 2
Who could possibly have wished for a sequel to Bert I Gordon s legendary bad trash film Food of the Gods Nobody of course but director Damien Lee thought it was a good idea anyway and he put together a belated sequel that stands as one of the most redundant movies in horror history Gnaw is a sequel in name only as the setting moved to a typical late 80 s location a university campus and also the cheap cheesy gore effects perfectly illustrates the 80 s This script hangs together by clichés awfully written dialogs and plot situations that are not so subtly stolen from other and more successful horror classics Neil Hamilton is a goody two shoes scientist who performs growing experiments on ordinary rodents in order to do a fellow scientist a favor Due to some incredibly stupid animal rights activists the huge and ravenous rats escape and devour pretty much everyone on campus Following the good old tradition that Spielberg s Jaws started there s an obnoxious Dean who refuses to admit the problem even though severely mutilated corpses are turning up everywhere During a hysterically grotesque climax the rats invade the opening ceremony of the campus new sport complex Gnaw Food of the Gods 2 is terribly bad and therefore a lot of fun to watch The characters do and say unimaginably stupid stuff like descending into the sewers unarmed while they KNOW it s infested with rats the acting is atrocious and there s a genuinely bizarre sequence involving the hero having sex under the influence of growth serum I wonder what Freud s theory would be on that There s a satisfying amount of gore and sleaze and it has to be said the music is surprisingly atmospheric In case you just can t get enough of this junk there are quite a lot of creature features revolving on mutated rats like the Italian schlock film Rats Night of Terror the modest 70 s cult film Willard and its lame sequel Ben the 2003 Willard remake starring Crispin Glover and the surprisingly good recent rat movies by once famous directors Tibor Ticaks Rats and John Lafia The Rats Go nuts
Camp Blood III is a vast improvement on Camp Blood II as it has sound mostly in the right places and a rudimentary plot This time they ve ventured slightly further away from the car park the other two movies were filmed in which is a good move as you can no longer hear cars driving past what is supposed to be a remote wilderness br br This time around there s a reality TV show and a fake clown to scare off the contestants This is hardly a new idea I ve seen at least three other horror movies with exactly the same premise where the real killer turns up but at least this one has a plot instead of people just randomly being stabbed with a knife br br Unlike the other two in the series this one is at least good for a few laughs I liked how there s a gunshot sound effect when someone gets stabbed early on and the way the boom mike hovers behind people like a phantom br br I don t know why anyone would want to make a third Camp Blood film I would have thought it would be better to start from scratch but they have at least tried with this one The half naked deformed woman was a bit much for me it looks like they tried to keep continuity by hiring some freak who would get her clothes off for 5 just like they did in the second movie They still haven t worked out that a machete is used for cutting not stabbing but oh well it s a Camp Blood movie what do you expect If you like crap films you ll get some fun out of this one
Nothing to say but Wow Has anyone actually had somebody sneak up on them in an open field Well this happens about 25 times in this movie clearly the directors favorite scare tactic In one of the opening scenes the smooth talking hot shot producer has to ride in the back seat so the camera man could sit in the front to film Shortly after he arrives to the field the 5 contestants show up and although it is clearly at latest 2 in the afternoon they are all convinced that the sun will set any minute After about 30 minutes of boobless trash we are privileged with a flashback of the clown s history in which we see some of his previous victims If you watch this movie check out the ladies chest her ribs go all the way to her neck it was flat out disgusting Most horror movies action occurs during the night but without a night vision camera the chaos is forced to happen during the day The few night shots that did make it in to the movie look like they were stolen from the Blair Witch Project or random shots from the directors backyard The movie somewhat redeemed itself in the end when there was a matrix like shoot out with the clown that we rewound and watched over and over laughing hysterically br br Definitely RENT THIS MOVIE IF YOU HAVE EVER BEEN SNUCK UP ON IN AN OPEN FIELD br br SIGNED THE ANSWER
This movie was probably the worst movie I have ever seen Here are the things that immediately jump out at me 1 The woods were more like hills in Los Angeles with a couple trees and brush Not scary whatsoever News flash if you are filming in the Southern California area big bear is only an hour away They actually have trees there br br 2 The writing was absolutely without a doubt the worst dialogue I have ever experienced Every possible line in the movie was unoriginal cliché or just plain stupid For instance the name of the camp is camp blood lame the name of the clown is the killer clown lame What is a clown doing in a forest anyway Was that the only mask they could find 3 The last but certainly the least was the acting Absolutely the worst group of actors and actresses ever assembled A virtual cornucopia of shitty lines and poor acting Worst part by far was when then randomly flash back to this fat foreign girl getting naked for a a photograph It s a really long scene and I guess she was supposed to be sexy but she was NOT Also and this was one of the few enjoyable parts of the movie for me was this tool who is supposed to be athletic For instance when he is bored in the movie he grabs a couple rocks and starts doing curls with them Then later on he is supposed to be running for the clown and it is immediately clear with his very girl like run that he is quite far from athletic Oh and to the girl who played Kat good Lord stop singing That song you sang for the credits makes me want to kill myself br br If for some reason you do see this movie I would at least recommend watching the special features The group of jackasses who made this film talk about it as if it is this really original story In fact one of the girls actually says that she let some of her friends read the screenplay and none of them could predict the ending Apparently she hangs out with special kids
After some internet surfing I found the Homefront series on DVD at ioffer com Before anyone gets excited the DVD set I received was burned by an amateur from home video tapes recorded off of their TV 15 years ago The resolution and quality are poor The images look like you would expect old re recorded video to look Although the commercials were edited out the ending credits of each episode still have voice over announcements for the segway into the ABC news program Nightline complete with the top news headlines from the early 1990 s Even with the poor image quality the shows were watch able and the sound quality was fine br br To this show s credit the casting was nearly perfect Everyone was believable and really looked the part Their acting was also above average The role of Jeff Metcalf is played particularly well by Kyle Chandler most recently seen in the 2005 remake of King Kong The period costumes were very authentic as were the sets especially the 1940s kitchens with vintage appliances and décor The direction was also creative and different for a TV show at that time For example conversations between characters were sometimes inter cut with conversations about the same subject between other characters in different scenes The dialog of the different conversations was kept fluid despite cutting back and fourth between the different characters and locations That takes good direction and editing and they made it work in this case br br As I started watching this series again I suddenly remembered why I lost interest in it 15 years ago Despite all the ingredients for a fine show the plots and story lines are disappointing and confusing right from the start For one thing the name of the show itself is totally misleading When WWII ended in 1945 there was no more fighting so obviously there was no longer a homefront either Curiously the first episode of the show Homefront begins in 1945 after the war had ended That s like shooting the first episode of Gilligan s Island showing the castaways being rescued The whole premise of the show s namesake is completely lost I still held on to hope with the possibility of the rest of the series being a flashback but no the entire show takes place from 1946 through 1948 Additionally this series fails miserably in any attempt to accurately portray any historical events of the late 1940 s By the third episode it becomes obvious that this series was nothing more than a thinly veiled vehicle for an ultra left wing political agenda The show is set in River Run Ohio near Toledo However the show s ongoing racism theme makes it look more like Jackson Mississippi than Ohio Part of the ensemble cast are Dick Williams Hattie Winston and Sterling Macer Jr who portray the Davis family Much of the series shows the Davis family being discriminated against by the evil whites to the point of being ridiculous and totally absurd if not laughable The racism card has been played and over played by Hollywood now for over 40 years We get it We re also tired of having our noses rubbed in it on a daily basis The subject of racism is also unpopular with viewers and it is the kiss of death for any show as it was for Homefront The acting talents of Williams Winston and Macer were wasted in their roles as the stereotypical frightened angry black family The wildly exaggerated racism in this series makes it look like everyone in Ohio was a KKK member or something The racism issue could have been addressed in this show in a single episode with a simple punch in the nose or fist fight in which a bigot gets a well deserved thrashing and leave it at that Devoting a major portion of the series to the racism thing gets really old really quick and its just plain stupid br br In yet another ridiculous plot line the big boss of a local factory Ken Jenkins is portrayed as an Ebenezer Scrooge like character who is against pensions and raises and is unconcerned about acid dripping on his employees The workers revolt and take over the factory in a blatant pro communist propaganda message to the viewer br br Personally I think this series had great potential The writers could have easily placed the timeline in 1941 1945 as the title suggests and shown the hardships of food and gas rationing and working 14 hour days at war factories Of course the loss of brothers sons and husbands fighting overseas would have also added drama The situation was also perfect for writing in special guest stars as military or USO personnel passing through their town during training or en route to Europe or the Pacific The possibilities for good story lines and plots are endless But no the writers of Homefront David Assael and James Grissom completely ignored any relevant or interesting plots Instead they totally missed the point and strayed into a bizarre and irrelevant obsession with racism and left wing politics It would be unfair to the actors to condemn the entire series but the plots and situations in which they were placed are total garbage
Why did I waste my money on this on the last day of Sundance I want a refund Can I have my 16 back While I was watching this film I kept waiting for something to happen nothing did happen The only way I even knew what it was supposed to be about was by reading the plot which was not really like the film why did the director zoom in with their handy cam and then zoom out It was not very artistic Why did the director show Lulu filing her nails for fifteen minutes Why is it when the actors tried to speak they sounded like they were reading Or was that the point I felt like Phantom Love had no story at all and to be honest I felt like my friends vacation videos had a much higher entertainment value than this film
This film was so disappointing From the blurb that made me decide to see Phantom Love why is it called this I had expected something arty and thoughtful with beautiful imagery It did have some interesting images but these often seemed random and made no sense In fact they seemed like they were inserted to fill in time In the end the effect was listless br br I believe the film was meant to be atmospheric but it just wasn t The lack of a coherent plot did not help matters You might say it was mysterious but I think it was just incoherent with no atmosphere br br The main character seemed to be disturbed but the plot did not draw me in enough to care about her situation Without looking at the cast list I would not have known that you see the main character as a child The film has very little context for the time place or character I am not a prude but the sex scenes there were several seemed pointless and confused me further I recognised Lulu but I was not sure if it was the same man different men a lover her husband or was she a prostitute It was only when I saw the credits that I discovered the hairy back was meant to belong to her lover This film did manage to make what should have been shocking dream sequences involving Lulu s mother seem a bit boring br br The nail filing actually made more sense as it did give some indication of Lulu s emotional state I will not fault the actors as I don t they had a lot to work on br br I do not know if the lack of context or flow in the film was because of ineptitude or because it was pretentious but the end result was dull br br I can t be bothered talking about it anymore
Del You are the dumbest smart person I ve ever met br br Calvin Well I had a brain but they lost it in the re writes br br I think what I find most egregious about this bastardization of Asimov s work was how the character of Susan Calvin was portrayed In the books she was actually one of the first strong female protagonists able to think her way through a problem Here she s just a damsel in distress waiting to be rescued by Wil Smith br br There are passing references to Asimov s Laws of Robotics but they are an afterthought to the CGI and action scenes br br Smith is likable as he is in most of his films but honestly the story isn t that good YOu figure it out long before these genius characters do
Waiting to go inside the theathre with tickets in my hand I expected an interesting sci fi fantasy movie which could finally feed my appetite of movies regarding robot technology instead I went disappointed by each aspect of it once more proving that stunning special effects can t help a boring plot which by my opinion was the worse in this year Acting in this movie also dissatisfied me Will Smith didn t show anything new in this movie yet I never saw his acting to change since Men In Black which was his only success by my opinion He had to retire since than not spoiling his name with titles like I Robot and Men In Black 2 4 10
I can t really think of any redeeming features of this utterly bad rendering on Asimov than the art direction Forget the product placement disaster the unconvincing performance from Will Smith and the gargantuan plot holes This wasn t only laughable and but painful to watch Even the action was boring A mixture of MTV inspired production values and utterly bad dialogue probably aimed at very small children br br What a shame that sci fi this bad can still be made after we ve had Bladerunner Minority Report or to a lesser extent Dark City by the same director This one really belongs in the bottom 100 list Truly awful
After perusing the large amount of comments on this movie it is clear that there are two kinds of science fiction movie goers There are the ones who are well read extremely literate and intelligent They know the history of the genre and more importantly they know to what heights it can reach in the hands of a gifted author For many years science fiction languished in the basement of literature Considered my most critic to be little more than stories of ray guns and aliens meant for pre pubescent teenagers Today s well read fan knows well this history and knows the great authors Asimov Heinlein Bradbury and Ellison who helped bring science fiction out of that basement In doing so they created thought provoking intelligent stories that stretched the boundaries and redefined the human condition This well informed fans are critical of anything Hollywood throws at them They are not critical for it s own sake but look upon each offering with a skeptical eye As they should as Hollywood s record has been less than stellar To these fans the story must take supreme importance They cannot be fooled by flashy computer graphics and non stop action sequences When the emperor has no clothes they scream it the loudest br br The second type of science fiction movie goer has little knowledge about the written aspect of the genre Look at many of the above comments that state Well I haven t read the book or anything by this author Their total exposure to science fiction is from movies or the Scifi channel They are extremely uncritical willing to overlook huge plot holes weak premises and thin story lines if they are given a healthy dose of wiz bang action and awesome special effects They are in effect willing to turn off their critical thinking skills or maybe they never had them for the duration of the movie Case in point I Robot While supposedly based on Asimov s short stories and named after one of his novels it contains little of what Asimov wrote and even less of what he tried to tell us about humanity and our robotic creations Those of you that will run out and buy I Robot will be very much surprised this movie isn t even based on that story at all br br The film has enormous plot holes that at some points are stretched to the limits of credulity I won t point them out I won t spoon feed you You need to practice you thinking skills and discover them for yourself The characters which are named after many of Asimov s characters do not possess the critical intelligence that was a hallmark of his stories The plot itself with all it s action sequences goes against everything that the author stood for His belief that humanity possesses the capacity to solve problems using their minds not their fists is vital to understanding his vision of the future In short other than the name their is very little of Isaac in anything about this movie There will always be those uncritical i e unthinking who will state The movie doesn t have to be like the book Due to the medium movies sometimes require that changes be made But what about a case where the movie never even tried to stay close to the book or books from the start What if all they took from the written work was the title This begs the question Why tarnish a great body of work by slapping it s title on your vacuous piece of crap Save money and don t buy the rights to the works Title it something else Don t use the character s names Believe me no one will accuse you of plagiarism In fact it won t matter what you title it to the unread moviegoer who accepts everything you throw at him But it will upset those who read who think who are unwilling to simply let you give them a pretty light show br br I Robot like much of Hollywood s take on the genre pushes Science fiction back down into that basement it lived in years ago Hollywood could not do this alone It takes an uncritical mindless audience that will accept puerile dredge like this
I just saw this film on DVD last night and decided to check out the reviews this morning It seems that I Robot has polarized the critical viewing community here on IMDb and given rise to a lot of insults and name calling too br br I find this somewhat surprising as this film is not great or even good but neither is it terrible or even really bad What this film really is is depressing Depressing that the US film goer population is so ready to lap up insipid clichéd re heats and acclaim them as spectacular new works This film as retread written all over it from the plot line an uneasy mix of Asimov and modern day uber action to Smith s character a smart mouthed cynic with a backbone of titanium to the special effects that borrowed from Matrix and a few others br br I Robot is sadly quite possibly the perfect action movie for today s audience superficial plot insipidly snappy dialog and lots and lots of adrenaline Smith is mediocre but we already knew that he seems to be Hollywood s latest unsuccessful attempt to create a black Bruce Willis The story has lots of holes in it of all sizes but I don t think most people drawn to this film are critically minded enough to notice Perhaps a blockbuster by today s standards but very B movie compared to true winners
This is probably the most boring worse and useless film I have seen last year The plot that was meant to have some philosophical aspects emerged to me as a very bad hollow copy of the matrix with plenty of clichés the lone wolf cop good looking psychologically disturbed sleeping with his gun nice hard worker and shy but good looking she scientist you add a 2 cent plot and you have I Robot I was terribly disturbed by the obvious advertising of brands like FedEx Audi converse etc This movie stinks the commercialization and tend to be more a poor ad spot that unfortunately will not end after 30 sec I wouldn t recommend this to my worse enemy if you have some spare time watch a good TV program instead or better read a nice book
In spite of the great future design touches the clever Asimov premise and Will Smith s dependable cool performance this movie doesn t live up to expectations The clichés come thick and fast waking from a recurring nightmare maverick cop has his badge revoked by hardass lieutenant to list more would be spoiling it you can see the end a mile off This movie is also stagebound you never feel that you have travelled anywhere what s supposed to be a global disaster never leaves an obviously CGI Chicago The robots themselves are good in closeup but the crowd scenes look more like bad Disney the CGI is overdone again and again And if you can destroy the robots by smashing them why do they need to inject nanites You know it s a duff movie when stupid questions like that start to bother you before the climax It could have been great but it s less than the sum of its parts mainly due to the utterly predictable plot that could have come from any action film of the last forty years
This film is the culmination of everything that is bad about modern film unnecessary slow motion unnecessary flipping jumping somersaults unnecessary characters unnecessary dialogue basically unnecessity is that a word well it s just been invented by I Robot br br What happened to practicality i e the car garage the skin spray the only tool that shows a combination of futuristic and realistic function is the card swipe at the coffee shop br br What happened to showing respect for women i e smith s character does nothing but degrade the doctor for the better part of the film and yet she still wants him WHERE IS THE TENSION I ll tell you where good looks and not admiration or common ground br br What happened to a detective that detects Smith did nothing but sit around and feel sorry for himself complaining to other people and when they said something that sparked a thought he was off this is such a lame way to get the story from point b c d etc it was OK once but not several times in a row speaking of several times in a row what was the I m snoring and not listening to you joke Twice In One Scene br br What happened to the small parts in a movie being somewhat meaningful and not just a tool to promote rescue scenes Shia LaBeouf the kid is in the movie for a total of TWO SCENES we know that A he degrades women and B he knows Smith so of COURSE we should care about him and whether or not he comes to harm br br What happened to Hero s let s just forget that there are people women and children everywhere getting attacked by robots and selfishly save the only person withing my view that I have an acquaintance with and why did he have to ramp his bike through the air showing off while the doctor was somehow able to reach the same distance in a matter of seconds on foot br br don t get me wrong I m all for spectacle but I m also all for a shred of realism and meaning br br I have to say I ve never laughed quite so hard at a film in a long time so thanks Alex br br I pray for the swing of the social pendulum back to simpler techniques simpler stories and simpler everything else in films but mainly simpler techniques br br Big Budget Action films you so have to die
This movie was a mess It had the absolute worst editing I have ever seen It was almost like at the end of a scene the writer wanted to go to commercial and the filmmaker added a second of black screen to fulfill the writers dream br br Under the messy direction and editing there was a glimmer of something good A good idea a compelling spark But somewhere it went wrong br br The story is about a quasi psychic priest who is trying to solve a string of murders The first thing that is hard to bite into is Richard Grieco as a priest Well the part doesn t call for him to be a good priest and he succeeds rather well The second problem is Dennis Hopper as the crazy bad guy He always plays the crazy bad guy Very ho hum br br Oh a thought occured to me that maybe all the jumpy horrible editing and disconnected plot was trying to add a sense of the confusion the character Grieco was experiencing And just to prove that it was contrived they rolled the credits backwords Not a good sign for any movie br br
This was an impulse pick up for me from the local video store Don t make the same mistake I did This movie is tedious unconvincingly acted and generally boring The dialogue between the young priest and his uncle is particularly poorly written and delivered I cringed at every scene they shared Dennis Hopper makes a few sparse appearances and is his usual disjointed self his role was clearly not a stretch for him And although the movie is supposedly set in Puerto Rico it feels a lot more like a Hollywood movie lot all of the main characters are Caucasian and several tend to speak English with pseudo Irish accents Odd Anyway when you see this one on the shelf of your local video store keep walking
First of all what is good in the movie Some pretty actress the exotic background the fact that the actors don t laugh while acting I would have if I had been in their situation I don t know The storyline is simple a catholic priest who does abstract painting tries to find out who another abstract painter killed his little brother a male prostitute raped by another priest when he was young I m afraid there is nothing here to learn or to let think a little about serial killers art or religion Dennis Hopper is not very good here This is the worst episode of the worst season of profiler the serie with replacement actors and unbelievable coincidences the uncle is the policeman who the girl who lives at another victim s house could have a baby with the priest etc etc
I ll give writer director William Gove credit for finding someone to finance this ill conceived thriller A good argument for not wasting money subscribing to HBO let alone buying DVDs based on cover art and blurbs A pedestrian Dennis Hopper and a game Richard Grieco add nothing significant to their resumes although the art direction is not half bad The dialogue will leave you grimacing with wonder at its conceit this is storytelling at its worst No tension no suspense no dread no fear no empathy no catharsis no nothing A few attractive and often nude females spice up the boredom but this is definitely a film best seen as a trailer I feel sorry for the guy who greenlighted this thing Good for late night zoned out viewing only You have been warned
A splendid example of how Hollywood could and still can take a masterpiece of literary fiction and stupidly foul it up br br In the case of the Big Sky writer Dudley Nichols and company arrogantly assumed they could improve upon a classic pioneer novel by the Pulitzer prize winning author A B Guthrie In so doing they removed the soul of the story and any edge and impact it may have had as a film adaptation br br The epic nature of Guthrie s book and the evolution of its main character Boone Caudill from a naive Kentucky lad into a hardened and competent survivor mountain man has been replaced with a downscaled riverboat farce that bears little resemblance to the author s intent In the movie version Boone s presence is nothing except underwhelming br br Intriguing and even shocking plot elements that give Guthrie s novel impact and excitement have been removed for no apparent reason whatsoever Most puzzling of all is the emphasis placed upon the Zeb Calloway character who was an incidental minor character in the book only occupying a handful of pages On the other hand a very important and fascinating character Dick Summers the veteran pioneer is missing altogether It is also apparent that director Hawks decided the Zeb character in the movie played by actor Hunnicutt wasn t irritating enough So Zeb Hunnicutt was given a significant amount of time doing that obnoxious voice over narration that is the Hollywood short cut for incompetent screen writing editing and direction br br Some movies have actually improved upon the books upon which they were based William Wyler s Ben Hur is an excellent example But this is horrible and depressing not only as an adaptation of a novel but as a film unto itself br br The story is dull and clichéd and the characters at least the ones that have not been edited out of the script are just shallow and boring shadows of Guthrie s literary vision And unfortunately Kirk Douglas star appeal which could have helped lift this film was scuttled by the milktoast role he was given br br If you can believe it the film version of Guthrie s Pulitzer prize winning sequel The Way West also starring Kirk is even worse br br In my opinion The Big Sky further solidifies Howard Hawks place as one of the most overrated tepid directors in the history of cinema
Anyone that has see Tammuz s Child Eaters knows that this is a director that can do better Let s hope it was not a case of too many hands in the pot Telefilm anyone and that is was a case of second feature jitters The characters are one dimensional and over used The scenery is terrific however and showcases the Pacific Northwest beautifully br br The cinematography is great Shot almost entirely outside the images are crisp and beautiful You can almost smell the wind blowing through the leaves br br Technically this movie is as sound as they come it just lacks a heart
Not only was this the most expensive Canadian film ever shot in BC but easily the worst never seeing the light of day The director is not even Canadian but British and boy does it show We are all made out to be a bunch of over sexed dope fiends and morons The spirit of what it means to be Canadian is absent and this is supposed to be the reason we fund this bunk Of course the British character is normal The rest are a crop of sitcom stereotype can you say Norm The cinematography ranges from pretty postcard images to murky indoor silhouettes The actors always seem to be fidgetting Are they as bored as the viewer or is this the directors idea of cinema Avoid this mess and check out some of Bruce Mcdonalds films A true Canadian boy with something original to say cinematically You won t be compelled to walk out on HIS films after 10 minutes
This movie makes Canadians and Brits out to be asinine moronic idiots The men get stoned drunk and then they yell beat each other up in almost every scene The women are superfluous to the story I do not understand what they are there for they spend every scene causing a ruckus or worse milling around like mesmerized cattle Apparently Canadian women are either quarrelsome vulgar tramps or hulking hippie chicks It s the standard knocked up girlfriend her loser boyfriend and his wicked mother ludicrousness that we have seen in countless movies before br br Every character here is a carping infantile stereotype Not to mention that they all looked like they need a shower And the idea of any kind of scene implying sex with George Wendt shudder is enough to make anyone gag I watched the movie because Samuel West was in it but I cannot understand why he would have accepted a role like this Maybe he needed the money Ian Tracey is a superb actor the only one with a vague redeeming moment but his talent is wasted here br br As for the rest of the plot the three imbeciles trying to get their dope back yawn or Karl who is dead but who is actually a character very much alive in the minds of those left behind almost like Rebecca in Alfred Hitchcock s masterpiece although I am ashamed to even have thought to compare these two films why even bother Karl is so galling that you find the circumstances of his death gratifying br br By the end of this wretched movie I thought they would all have been better off going down with him on that boat
I found this on the shelf while housesitting and bored How can people possibly give this a 10 It s not just that it s supposed to be a feel good redemption film I think because it doesn t work on that level either Weak plot bad dialogue terrible acting there s just nothing there Harvey Keitel is decent but has nothing to work with and Bridget Fonda and especially Johnathon Schaech are just terrible The plot progression especially the relationship between Byron and Ashley makes no sense It seems like the writers wanted the plot to go a certain way and made it without actually writing in the necessary bits to make it flow It s only an hour and a half but that s 90 minutes of your life you ll never get back
Might contain possible spoilers Not that anything in this film is new or will even mildly surprise you for that matter br br Why does Disney feel the need to recycle everything they ever made into oblivion Sure it s cheaper for them but after a while wouldn t you think there overall quality and the way people think of them would drop off House Of Villains is a despicable display of cartoon crossovers that make absolutely no sense at all Some signs of the total disregard for previous films in this are The voices don t even remotely match up and Iago is evil again Since when I know that these films are directly towards children but there was a time when all could enjoy Disney films Even the movie s musical number which had been Disney s specialty for years stunk I wouldn t recommend this film to anyone even the very young All I can is that if more of these movies of the same caliber are released it s only a matter of time before some small animation studio surpasses Disney in overall quality
Have not watched kids films for some years so I missed Here Come the Tigers when it first came out Never even saw Bad News Bears even though in the 70s I worked for the guys who arranged financing for that movie Warriors Man Who Would Be King and Rocky Horror Picture Show among others Now I like to check out old or small movies and find people who have gone on to great careers despite being in a less than great movie early on Just minutes into this movie I could take no more and jumped to the end credits to see if there was a young actor in this movie who had gone on to bigger and better things at least watching for his her appearance would create some interest as the plot and acting weren t doing the job Lo and behold I spied Wes Craven s name in the credits as an electrical gaffer He d already made two or three of his early shockers but had not yet created Freddie Krueger or made the Scream movies Maybe he owed a favor and helped out on this pic More surprising was Fred J Lincoln in the cast credits as Aesop a wacky character in the movie F J Lincoln from the 70s to just a few years ago appeared in and produced adult films He was associated with the adult spoof The Ozporns and just that title is funnier than all of Tigers attempts at humor combined Let the fact that an adult actor was placed in a kids movie be an indication as to how the people making this movie must have been asleep at the wheel
The saddest part of this is the fact that these are 87 minutes I ll never get back I knew this was terrible from the get go with the guy dressed as a lunatic Indian chief on top of the roof See if they could get away with that in 2008 My 10 year old boy is really into baseball right now so we decided to rent it on a rainy day Even though he seemed to enjoy parts of it I had to cringe when I heard all the needless foul language Bad bad movie This was an awful ripoff of Bad News Bears Completely shameless and completely predictable I don t mind a predictable movie if it s done well but this one absolutely was not
I just watched this horrid thing on TV Needless to say it is one of those movies that you watch just to see how much worse it can get Frankly I don t know how much lower the bar can go br br The characters are composed of one lame stereo type after another and the obvious attempt at creating another Bad News Bears is embarrassing to say the VERY least br br I have seen some prized turkeys in my time but there is no reason to list any of them since this is Numero Uno br br Let me put it to you this way I watched the Vanilla Ice movie because it was so bad it was funny This this is NOT even that good
What a stinkeroo this turned out to be At one time much earlier in her career Linda Darnell was one of my favorites no great shakes as an Actress but very beautiful and pleasant particularly in films like The Mark of Zorro and Blood and Sand but when I saw this monstrosity the memories of her golden days faded quickly The story is unbelievable and farcical the acting second rate the supporting cast insufferable I cannot think of a more immature performance by anyone when compared to Tab Hunter and Donald Gray had to be the most boring leading man they could have picked Added to this was the terrible photography and I am not just referring to the color Everyone associated with this must have shuddered whenever it was shown
This movie is horrible It rivals Ishtar in the number of embarrassingly bad moments I would have rated it lower than a 3 save for a couple of funny lines but overall this film was crap It looked like they made it over a weekend at some bankrupt resort somewhere Joe Roth should join Elaine May on the directing sidelines forever
When my wife and I decided to watch this movie we thought it couldn t fail I love Billy Crystal my wife loves Julia Roberts and everyone we talked to said they loved it br br We were misled in spades br br On my part I felt Billy Crystal s character was extremely one dimensional and did very little for the film Sure he cracked a couple of good jokes but as a character he did nothing but take up space br br And poor Julia Roberts In past shows she plays well as a strong willed self determined lady In this flick she seems completely repressed and had very little fire This is not the Julia Roberts that my wife enjoys watching br br OK if I were to find one good thing it would have to be Christopher Walken Now that s entertainment But just like Billy Crystal hardly anything is shown of his character br br If you re looking for a night of mindless laughs with very little redeeming value go see it But if you re looking for a smart romantic comedy this is not your film It s none of the above
Shame on Julia Roberts and John Cusack They are so talented and should not have had any part in this movie The storyline was dumb and predictable The jokes were not funny The romance was not really romance I was all too happy when this movie ended
Characters you don t care about relationships you don t care about and you sit through all that to see the ending you knew was coming from the start Julia Roberts usually leaves no impression on me one way or the other She was actually somewhat endearing in this role
I found this film to be an utter dissapointment The talent available to the director notably Stanley Tucci Chris Walken Hank Azaria and Alan Arkin without even mentioning the four main leads have been completely wasted on an unfunny mediocre story whose conclusion one couldn t really care about once introduced to the dire stereo typed characters Julia Roberts is feeble Zeta Jones is just plain annoying appearing to reprise her role from high fidelity minus the humour Crystal just plays his same old hyper active neurotic annoying alter ego and Cusack simply walks through his part apparently bored with the whole project br br For what is supposed to be a Romantic comedy there is absolutely no romance between the central characters let alone chemistry and as for the comedy possible SPOILERS well the only moments of mild humour came off the back of Cusack s role in Grosse Pointe and his relationship with Alan Arkin the scriptwriter obviously unable to show any originality whatsoever Spoilers Azaria was reasonably amusing as the Mexican lover and Walken did quite an amusing turn as a parody of an arthouse maverick Dogme type director but these parts constituted very little screen time and instead Spoilers we were treated to Billy Crystal having his groin sniffed by a dog Pure genius br br For a huge fan of the majority of John Cusack s work not to mention the rest of the fantastic cast I was completely let down by a film with plenty of good ideas and at the same time completely unwilling to explore or elaborate on any of them instead resorting to the same old genre cliches and even lowering itself to the depths of almost gross out teen movie humour at times br br A very poor 4 10
Billy Crystal normally brings the crowd to laughter but in this movie he and all the rest of them cannot bring any smile on my face or perhaps just one They call it comedy I say it s a waste of my time
In fact it never was I m not sure why Billy Crystal wanted to recreate a 1940s screwball comedy What a vacuous shambles None of these people come close to a Cary Grant Spencer Tracy Katherine Hepburn etc and anyway today s audience isn t as receptive to this facile muck Writing is trivial The hackneyed plot is razor thin and obvious The chemistry between the leading characters is non existent It s interesting that Julia Roberts seems to think she s a reincarnation of some big star from the golden age of Hollywood whenever that may be It s an effect she tries and fails to attain yet again with Richard Gere in Runaway Bride
the only scenes wich made me laugh where the ones with christopher walken in it the crazy filmdirector the rest of the movie was just boring in the first hour or so nothing really happens jokes which supposed to be funny aren t and zeta jones douglas is really overacting julia roberts does a routine job of the former ugly duck yeah right into the girl next door where did i see this before who gets the guy for short i really didn t care what would happen with the main characters if cusack really fell of the building in a suicide attempt the movie could have been more interresting to watch
I have seen a lot of bad movies with big actors in it But this movie was terrible I have yet to see why people thought it was funny The idea behind it is stupid Plus all the things that are supposed to be funny are just dumb Why anyone would want to watch this more than once just baffles me
It was disgusting and painful What a waste of a cast I swear the audience 1 2 full laughed TWICE in 90 minutes This is not a lie Do not even rent it br br Zeta Jones was just too mean to be believable br br Cusack was OK Just OK I felt sorry for him the actor in case people remember this mess br br Roberts was the same as she always is Charming and sweet but with no purpose The romance with John was completely unbelievable
Wow what a great cast Julia Roberts John Cusack Christopher Walken Catherine Zeta Jones Hank Azaria what s that A script you say Now you re just being greedy Surely such a charismatic bunch of thespians will weave such fetching tapestries of cinematic wonder that a script will be unnecessary You d think so but no America s Sweethearts is one missed opportunity after another It s like everyone involved woke up before each day s writing shooting editing and though You know what I ve been working pretty hard lately and this is guaranteed to be a hit with all these big names right I m just gonna cruise along and let somebody else carry the can So much potential yet so painful to sit through There isn t a single aspect of this thing that doesn t suck Even Julia s fat suit is lame
How this film was made with so many big stars is beyond me This is a terrible cliché ridden film with the worst acting any of these actors have ever done It really surprises me that so many of these A list stars would agree to this unfunny film What s even worse is the fact that is made almost 100 million here in the states It does go to show however that big stars can pull in the bucks even if the film is terrible I felt sorry for everyone involved in this snore fest Billy Crystal tried his best with the what he was given and the rest of the stars seemed to be walking through the motions Whatever you do don t fall for the excellent cast because no one could have saved this
Let me put it another way balls Or how about bollo ks This is truly awful more embarrassing than those it attempts to satirise Julia Roberts is a skilled actress and usually her work is of the highest standard This movie is so lacking in direction even she struggles to look proficient Normally she is the consummate professional yet I swear that in her eyes there were signs of bewilderment and despair br br The one thing that might have rescued this move was the idea about the director Chris Walken turning the movie into a secret documentary about the actors Unfortunately that theme wasn t explored to it s full potential Too little too late br br Zeta Jones was wooden Cusack was Cusack and Crystal should stick to acting The two talented ex Buffy stars had different experiences Green hopelessly mis cast and Balfour under used Well done to Julia for just about preventing this from being the worst movie ever made
And I mean ultra light This film features four giant stars about three and a half jokes and nothing beyond that br br There really isn t too much to say about this stinker other than that although it has a couple of really good bits most of it isn t very funny Nor does it work at all as a romance How about as a romantic comedy Not on your life Most of the dialogue is way too flat to be sophisticated much less amusing br br What s really ashame is the premise is not bad at all This movie could have been so much more especially with all the recent focus on some of the bogus ways in which films are promoted complete with phony quotes from critics The film uncovers the un mined territory of the press junket those all expense paid trips for journalists who almost always write nice reviews But instead of exploring what should have been a motherlode of jokes it devotes all of about three minutes to this territory and moves on in pursuit of the film s lame romance br br The same with Catherine Zeta Jones character the whinny self centered movie star Zeta Jones does a good job with what she s given but she s given practically nothing It s all homogenized junk that looks very pale in comparison with some of the things we ve heard about stars over the years br br In the end it is hard to understand what made Zeta Jones Julia Roberts John Cusack and Billy Crystal sign aboard this doomed ship which sinks like a rerun of The Love Boat In fact as the old joke goes they should have forgotten the script and filmed the deal It would probably make a better story So go ahead and tell us filmmakers what do you have on these stars that got them to appear in this
If you are expecting to see a lot in the bath of Alt 305 oklar as it is promised by the tag line you will be very disappointed to see that the movie consists of nothing but the populist style of Alt 305 oklar regarding most famous issues like sex marriage and cheating To much nudity which seems to appear from nowhere and has no connection or whatsoever to the plot proves that Alt 305 oklar was unsuccessfully to try something new as he has quoted To much sex centered jokes seems to show that Alt 305 oklar had fallen for the famous saying which is sex sells I was hoping to see a very good story told with a very good narration technique However in the end I found myself sitting down for 90 minutes and watching Alt 305 oklar s experimental yet still to much focused on popularism work
First of all I am not a huge fan of contemporary Turkish cinema which is because the usual pattern of creating a box office success is by hitting below the waistline This movie is nothing of an artistic masterpiece that deals with taboos as the director and marketing ads imply In my mere opinion the sole purpose of this movie is make money by touching a sensitive morale in fact it is mostly considered taboo in the native country Cheap populism might provide with a brief definition of what I meant br br However the acting is near perfect In fact most of the cast has theatrical background and tried hard to compensate for what Altioklar lacked talent All members of the cast were perfectly fit in their roles and well qualified for the job even the less experienced ones Like Janset At least Altioklar deserves a small word of appreciation just because he knows well how to choose the cast Other than that he is just a media monkey who presumes himself a director with an artistic talent Come on art is not something that solely consists of dealing with naked half naked women And just because media boasts off no director becomes a milestone in the history of Turkish cinema Just close your ears and o something real artistic I am waiting eagerly to applause your next work Hope this time you manage to achieve an artistic approach br br In short Pros Good acting hot women just kidding Cons Each and every single thing other than the cast
Terrible movie If there is one Turkish film you should avoid seeing in 2006 that should be Banyo What a waste of time Other than couple of cheap laughs this movie achieves nothing nada zilch nil The dialog is cheap and sexual clichés are all over it The director needs to watch more films before attempting to direct his own The red headed women displays examples of what an actress should not do If you are interested in learning how not to act this is a perfect example of bad acting The only good thing I can say about the movie is wait wait there is nothing good I can say about it I must have really disliked it to write about it this much Jeez
this movie offers nothing but the dumbest conversations possible as a matter of fact i most probably could not have imagined how meaningless a film how synthetic the dialogs could be until an hour ago but then again i saw this video in a movie that does not depend on a powerful script one expects to see at least good acting and tasty conversations and even some humor maybe yet this movie lacks them all you heard me it lacks them all there is not a single point i like about this movie none i hate it i m sure anyone will do so too the name is intended to give the target audience some thoughts of nudity and stuff yet it fails even at the nudity i don t know how but i beared to watch this thing for an hour or so and i definitely recommend you don t do so worst movie i ve seen in my entire life if someone offers you to watch it ruuun awaaaaay saaaaaave your liiiiiiiiife
I saw this film at the 2005 Toronto International Film Festival Based on a novella by science fiction author Brian Aldiss this film attempts to tell the story of Tom and Barry Howe conjoined twins who are plucked from their family by an impresario in order to form a rock band br br Almost deliberately gimmicky the film is also too clever by half if you ll pardon the pun By mixing genres styles and moods the directors whose previous film was the excellent documentary Lost In La Mancha lose their way pretty quickly I was never sure whether I was meant to take it all seriously or not Flashbacks dream sequences it was all just a bit much Plus the promised rock and roll just didn t move me I was reminded a bit too much at times of Hedwig and the Angry Inch a film I found original and moving But in this case the songs just weren t as good nor were the main characters sympathetic A more unfavourable comparison would be the similarly disappointing Velvet Goldmine
This is quite possibly the worst movie of all time It stars Shaquille O Neil and is about a rapping genie Apparently someone out there thought that this was a good idea and got suckered into dishing out cash to produce this wonderful masterpiece The movie gets 1 out of 10
Would someone tell shaq to stick to what he is good at basketball This movie was not even entertaining on a stupid level In this movie shaq plays a genie who lives in a boom box is that not orginal a genie in a boom box instead of a lamp He is supposed to help a little boy played by the equally annoying francais cappra This movie had the most flimsy storyline since water world the acting was awful and I think that anyone who likes this flim would be afraid to admit it
This film proves that the commercial cinema or else the Hollywood movies are in a serious crisis There is absolutely no reason that this movie should have been produced apart from the fact that somebody expected success based on Shaquille s name There is no worth referring to the plot it is a bit more perplexed than a knot What else The screen is somewhat dim O Neal is a bad actor but Francis Capra is even worse br br Rating 1 10
There was a genie played by Shaq His name was Kazaam and he was whack His rhymes were corny this lines were bad some stupid kid cryin over his stupid dad bad actin bad casting bad special effects whats next this movie sucks Prolly didn t make 20 bucks he lives in a boombox not a lamp hurts like a cramp like a wet food stamp br br Yeah you get it a stupid rhyming genie who can t act in a stupid movie with horrible special effects Oh and its confusing as hell I m not even gonna go on Let s just say it belongs in the its so bad its funny category Watch it once with your buddies and get a good laugh But don t expect anything spectacular
Yes Kazaam is one of those horribly bad movies that almost reminds one of everything that is wrong with not just kids movies but with humanity Here we have Shaq as a rapping genie yes a RAPPING genie where he does everything from making bad puns to dressing in ridiculous outfits all ending in him in a Christ like pose with lots of light surrounding him So yeah expect really cheesy bits including the first wish being a lot of junk food falling down from the sky and regrettably not knocking out the two main characters particularly the kid What might not be expected is that a film with a kid and Shaquille O Neill would be so incredibly schmaltzy The main plot of the film involves this kid played in that all too typical and annoying kid fashion by the great grandson of Frank Capra where in which the kid is yelling out his dialog angrily who comes upon a genie who s been trapped in a boom box Then hiarity ensues as the kid makes the Shaq genie his quasi slave as he waits on his last two wishes as he tries to make amends with his shady gang type absentee father br br This really sappy contrived son and father story would be bad enough as there are certain lines that have been uttered in a million other movies i e the two chances in life speech from father to son But it s Shaquille O Neill who is both the reason to watch the film ironically and the obvious sinking crux of it all His plot line involves him when not getting the over talky treatment from Capra to rap within the dialog and also start off his blossoming recording career On top of this he also kicks ass and takes names with the main bad guys who want him back in the boom box So is there a camp factor to the movie Up to a point but this is even squashed by all of the mushy scenes and heart felt moments that have really no business with the rest of the material One might ask if the people making the movie who were obviously doing it at the behest of the popularity of a BASKETBALL player who wanted to go on the Michael Jordan acting bandwagon if it would be anywhere near decently entertaining or convincing I d hope that they too knew they were just getting paid But I d hope even more that they felt at least a little guilty afterwords for feeding the Shaq machine br br So if you want to have a fun night of Shaq as genie turned rapper turned wisecracker all the more fun to you Hell it might even be interesting to have a Shaq movie night with this and his other critically acclaimed effort Steel But if you re hoping to keep a few brain cells stay away from what is very likely the worst flick of 1996 and a candidate among many others for worst of the 90 s
This movie is so so so horrible that it makes angels lose their wings Shaq had tried to make other crossover efforts like his work in Shaq Fu for the NES and his plethora of unbearable rap albums and later the epic serving of horrible film making that is Steel br br There s not a single good thing to be said about this movie I saw it a bunch of times when I was very young but I must ve been an idiot then because this movie takes all that is enjoyable about films and tears it apart It s fun to mock I saw it on the Disney Channel a while back and spent a few minutes doing that Although once the thrill of mocking it is done you still become overwhelmed by its terribleness br br If you see it on TV try this consider as your watching the film removing from it all the scenes in which Shaq uses his magical genie powers If you do that it becomes like a film about a pedophile chasing a kid and rapping to seduce him That s kinda funny and disturbing br br A horrible example of film Do not unless looking to mock it see this movie
What was the point of this movie What was the plot I do not know Shaq can t act people don t know how to direct and I am Kazaam A genie who raps Come on Maybe Eminem or Linkin Park will be in a movie like this I remember I watched this just to kill time It didn t really interest me I just remember thinking Who put Shaq in this movie The whole story seemed stupid too It made no sense whatsoever I guess an unrealized moral of this movie is that you can find anything in the ghetto and anything can happen I can t comment much more because this movie is so terrible there s nothing worth commenting about I wish this movie would go away
Now I m one to watch movies that got poor reviews and say Hmm this isn t so bad I loved The Cable Guy and thought that My Big Fat Independent Movie was great Keep in mind I really didn t start watching this with high hopes but I figured that maybe just maybe it would be bad in a kind of way I could laugh at it I was wrong At no point at all during my suffering through this film And I use that term sparingly was I even close to being mildly entertained To start Shaq makes Quentin Tarantino look like Marlon Brando when it comes to acting I hate rap music but as far as I could tell an Amish priest would probably make a better rapper than him The main character is simply annoying and not a character that it s easy to like Quite frankly I would rather eat a greasy turd out of a Harlequin fetus bloody sores than watch this again
Let me give a quick summery of the film A rotten rude kid named Max stumbles upon a radio that contains Kazaam a rapping genie Like all genies he grants 3 wishes but being good natured also helps Max with his personal life as he has to deal with bullies and a father mixed up in organized crime During all this Kazaam raps from time to time also showcasing Shaq s dismal rap skills br br This movie proves what we all know Athletes need to stick to sports I admit that it never looked like an Oscar worthy movie but EVERYTHING about this waste of film is horrible The characters are either unlikable or stupid the plot is not even worth mentioning the dialog is a joke and Shaq is only a quarter of the problem Hell even if Denzel Washington played Kazaam this movie would still be a joke I know that the movie only drew ANYBODY was because Shaq was so big no pun intended at the time I honestly cannot think of a single positive thing to say about this waste of time Shaq should have put the time had used to make this movie toward practicing free throws
OK so after watching this invigorating movie and wasting an hour and so many minutes off my life here is the basic summary Genie comes out of ghetto boom box gives this kid with shaggy hair 3 wishes the kid wastes his wishes on i forget what shaq sucks at rapping and i guess thats it br br So mainly I laughed I cried but mainly I laughed at the shear comedy that came from the wonderful acting skills of an nba player rapper and boy with shaggy hair br br I highly recommend this movie for college kids sitting around drinking some beers with their close friends and are in serious need of a good laugh br br I m going to give it a 3 out of 10 only b c the movie is based off of 3 magical wishes br br If I had 3 wishes one would be to erase this horrible movie and for everyone to pretend like Hollywood didn t waste money on making this
Reviewing KAZAAM and saying it s a bad movie isn t hard at all after all critics at the time it came out fell all over themselves excoriating this film saying it was among the worst films of the decade So the fact that I say it s bad or anyone else says it s bad is certainly no surprise It s like someone talking about WWII practically no one says that was a GOOD thing right The question I have and no place on IMDb can answer it is why did they make this in the first place After all it s obvious to anyone who isn t severely brain injured that the film would be horrible But movies like ED a baseball playing chimp COOL AS ICE starring the ever popular Vanilla Ice TROLL 2 which doesn t even have any trolls in it BABY GENIUSES Einstain like superhero babies and PINOCCHIO IN OUTER SPACE huh prove that any idea no matter how dumb can make it to the big screen So the idea of the best basketball player of the time starring as a genie to an obnoxious little brat seems downright normal br br The film starts with a kid who is pretty jerky keying the lockers in the hallway of the school Like the punk from FREE WILLY this kid is somehow misunderstood in other words a total brat and you know that no matter how selfish and horrible he is by the end of the film he ll have learned something and grown Just once I want to see a punk kid like this end up in prison or or dead by the end of the film Eventually while the neighborhood bullies are in the middle of pummeling him the genie Kazaam Shaquille O Neal is accidentally released and insists on giving the brat three wishes But the kid doesn t believe him AND the genie s magic seems a tad rusty br br Eventually the brat does realize that Kazaam is for real However unlike most kids he withholds making his wishes so in the meantime Kazaam is forced to follow him around everywhere like his own personal servant And according to the cliché you know that by the end of the film Max and Kazaam will have become lifelong buddies and a bunch of tears will be shed Oh and Max will have come to terms with his absent father and mom s fiancé I m gonna gag Apparently this genie is a bit of a social worker in addition to being a granter of wishes br br As for Kazaam Shaquille speaks in rhyme through much of the movie and even takes a break to rap very poorly I m a middle aged white guy and I think I could probably rap at least as well He s an amazing basketball player and I ve heard he s a nice guy but a rapper no way As far as his acting goes he wasn t great but had such a nice personality in the film that it s hard to hate him even if they made him do a lot of very stupid things br br So is the movie as excruciatingly awful as you ve probably heard through the first two thirds of the movie I would have said no Shaquille seemed to try his best with an unlikable kid and a bad script However later in the film the bad becomes horrid as Kazaam seems too concerned with himself to help the kid when he s really needed And out of nowhere the plot gets really really weird as the guy who wants to make Kazaam a rap star turns out to be an evil mobster And oddly this guy seems to accept that Kazaam is a genie with no hesitation br br In addition the last portion of the film consists of people trying to kill Max and his dad I know that the kid was annoying but this is supposed to be a kids film What part of trying to kill the kid didn t the writers not understand Then in an ending that makes this perhaps the worst kids film ending in history Kazaam becomes god or something and it all was like a drug induced hallucination This ending was even dumber and weirder than the one in THE BLACK HOLE and boy did it make my brain hurt Uggghh the horrible dialog was just too much to bear br br Overall it s a terrible film that is due mostly to writers who were certifiably insane Yes folks with a messed up message bizarre non kid friendly material and horrible characters this is one wretched film Sadly given the idea and actors it s hard to imagine the final product turning out much worse br br By the way if you want to see a Genie in a modern world film that is GOOD try the British made for TV film Bernard and the Genie a charming and exceptionally well written film from start to finish
The only reason I DVRd this movie was because 1 I live in Cleveland and Shaq plays basketball for us now and 2 I ve always heard how awful it was The movie did not disappoint The best parts were Shaq s outfits The worst parts were well just about everything else My 12 year old son and I just squirmed and couldn t look at the screen when Shaq started rapping and we kept wondering why Max didn t wish for Kazzam to fix that front tooth of his But for all it s terribleness we just couldn t stop watching it the story sucked you in like a black hole or quicksand or a tar pit it was hypnotic But it was worth it for the laughs and just to say that we actually watched Kazzam
If you are a fan of really bad movies and you think there funny you will the great acting of Shaq First off putting pro players in movies hardly ever works Shaq had to of been the worst actor i have ever seen next to Dennis Rodman who also made a few bad movies Well any way this movie is also bad due to the hideous kid I would give this a zero but that is impossible
This movie has successfully proved what we all already know that professional basket ball players suck at everything besides playing basket ball Especially rapping and acting I can not even begin to describe how bad this movie truly is First of all is it just me or is that the ugliest kid you have ever seen I mean his teeth could be used as a can opener Secondly why would a genie want to pursue a career in the music industry when even though he has magical powers he sucks horribly at making music Third I have read the Bible In no way shape or form did it say that Jesus made genies Fourth what was the deal with all the crappy special effects I assure you that any acne addled nerdy teenager with a computer could make better effects than that Fifth why did the ending suck so badly And what the hell is a djin And finally whoever created the nightmare known as Kazaam needs to be thrown off of a plane and onto the Eiffel Tower because this movie take the word suck to an entirely new level
i was given the book version of Kazaam for my 8th birthday and people always say the book versions are always better than the movie but this time they were wrong At least with the movie it s over soon br br The acting in this is terrible which i expected from a film with Shaq who plays a magical rapping genie that comes out of an old ghetto blaster which there was probably a good reason he was trapped in there The kid in the film that plays Max is whiny and a terrible actor He s bullied by neighborhood kids which i don t blame them because he s a little douche bag br br The story is just plain stupid and extremely cliché About a boy who s father is always working and never around who finds a new friend who makes his life better and eventually helps him reconnect with his father br br Even at 8 years old i thought this was a stupid idea It s a surprise any of the people whom worked on this film had careers after wards because it s an embarrassment and should have never been made i could ramble on even more about how this movie sucks but you should already know just by reading the plot
This is the worst film I have ever seen I was watching this film with some friends and after 40 minutes we had enough The plot was bad and there wasn t a single likeable character I could get more entertainment watching static I gave this movie a 1 only because the scale didn t go into negative numbers Avoid this movie at all costs
There s only one thing I need to say about this movie the scene where Shaq is in a musical number with Francis Capra s character about wanting to be a genie never see this movie The story is horrible the acting is terrible c mon it s Shaq and I d rather see Capra in Free Willy equally horrible twice before ever seeing this movie
This is one of the most god awful movies ever Shaq better just stick to basketball This movie took away apart of my life I will never have back I will make fun of this movie until I die and then some It is so horrible it is not even funny MST3000 would have a blast with this one
What a pathetic movie br br I won t waste much time commenting about it I m still trying to get back the couple hours I wasted on it br br Let me leave it simply with Shaq has NO BUSINESS being an actor or singer He is utterly without talent at both discplines It s a crying shame that substantially more talented people waste away in community theatres and karaoke bars while Shaq uses his name as a basketball player to undeservedly get cast in movies and cut CDs br br Much of the failure of this movie was the pathetic no talent that is Shaq
The first half of this version was the best I ve seen and I think I ve seen every version of Jane Eyre ever made The development of Jane s childhood and character were exceptional Then it was as though someone said Uh oh this is running too long and hacked the rest of the story to shreds The major scenes when included at all are glossed over combined and put out of order in such a way that they completely change the storyline There was so little transition or even scene development that it would be difficult for anyone not familiar with the story even to follow The big disappointment was that the beginning opened so much hope and then the end dashed it
As a Jane Eyre fan I was excited when this movie came out At last I thought someone will make this book into a movie following the story actually written by the author Wrong If the casting director was intending to cast a Jane who was plain he certainly succeeded However surely he could have found one who could also act Where was the tension between Jane and Rochester Where was the spooky suspense of the novel when the laughter floated into the night seemingly from nowhere Where was the sparkle of the child who flirted and danced like her mother Finally why was the plot changed at the end One wonders whether the screenwriters had actually read the book What a disappointment
I love the book Jane Eyre and have seen many versions of it All have their strong points and their faults However this was one of the worst I have seen I didn t care about Jane or Mr Rochester Charlotte Gainsbourg Jane was almost tolerable and certainly looked the plain part but she had no emotion in any of her lines I couldn t imagine what Mr Rochester saw in her br br That brings us to Mr Rochester William Hurt had even less emotion than Jane if that were possible How two such insipid people could fall in love is a mystery but it certainly didn t hold my attention Perhaps the director Zeffrelli fell asleep during the production br br The Timothy Dalton too handsome for Mr Rochester version is far more faithful to the book but Ciaran Hinds plays the perfect Mr Rochester in the 1997 A E version which is NOT all that true to the book br br Trying to find something positive about this movie Geraldine Chaplain was perfect in her role
Oh just what I needed another movie about 19th century England Which is pretty much like regular England only nobody s vandalising football stadiums In this picturesque setting of lords dames and other randomly chosen titles Charlotte Gainsbourg walks around aimlessly as Jane Eyre from that novel nobody has ever read willingly Jane usually hangs out in Mr Rochester s crib where she tries to teach a French girl to look at an empty chalkboard all the time One day Mr Rochester William Hurt on auto pilot comes back to fall in love with Jane and all that but there s still the matter of his fruitcake wife that is locked in the attic Oops that wasn t in the brochure After some people being thrown around and some carefully spread fire they probably rented the set the movie finally comes to an end Everything looked really authentic that s something I guess But then again nah
This 1996 movie was the first adaptation of Jane Eyre that I ever watched and when I did so I was appalled by it So much of the novel had been left out and I considered William Hurt to be terribly miscast as Rochester Since then I have watched all the other noteworthy adaptations of the novel the three short versions of 44 70 and 97 and the three mini series of 73 83 and 2006 and I have noticed that there are worse adaptations and worse Rochesters br br This is without doubt the most exquisite Jane Eyre adaptation as far as cinematography is concerned Director Franco Zerifferelli revels in beautiful long shots of snow falling from a winter sky of lonely Rochester standing on a rock and of Jane looking out of the window but he is less good at telling a story and bringing characters to life In addition his script merely scratches the surface of the novel by leaving out many important scenes As a consequence the film does not show the depth and complexity of the relationship between Jane and Rochester and sadly it does also not include the humorous side of their intercourse There are a number of short conversations between Rochester and Jane each of them beautifully staged but the couple of sentences they exchange do not suffice to show the audience that they are drawn to each other We know that they are supposed to fall in love but we never see it actually happen The scene in which Rochester wants to find out Jane s reaction to his dilemma by putting his case in hypothetical form before her after the wounded Mason has left the house is completely missing and the farewell scene the most important scene the climax of the novel is reduced to four sentences Zerifferelli does not make the mistake other scriptwriters have made in substituting their own poor writing for Brontë s superb lines neither are crucial scenes completely changed and rewritten but he makes the less offensive but in the end similarly great mistake of simply leaving many important scenes out What remains is just a glimpse of the novel which does no justice to Charlotte Brontë s masterpiece br br The cast is a mixed bag While Fiona Shaw is an excellent Mrs Reed Anna Paquin s young Jane is more an ill mannered pout Lolita than a lonely little girl longing for love The ever reliable Joan Plowright makes a very likable but far too shrewd Mrs Fairfaix and one cannot help feeling that Billie Whitelaw is supposed to play the village witch instead of plain looking hard working Grace Poole Charlotte Gainsbourgh as the grown up heroine however is physically a perfect choice for playing Jane Eyre Looking every bit like 18 thin and frail with irregular strong features she comes closest to my inner vision of Jane than any other actress in that role And during the first 15 minutes of her screen time I was enchanted by her performance Gainsbourgh manages well to let the audience guess at the inner fire and the strong will which are hidden behind the stoic mask But unfortunately the script never allows her to expand the more passionate and lively side of Jane s character any further As a result of leaving out so many scenes and shortening so much of the dialogues Gainsbourgh s portrayal of Jane must necessarily remain incomplete and therefore ultimately unsatisfactory This is a pity as with a better script Charlotte Gainsbourgh might have been as good a Jane as Zelah Clarke in the 83 version br br But while it is still obvious that Gainsbourgh is trying to play Jane there is no trace whatsoever of Rochester in the character that William Hurt portrays Hurt who has proved himself to be a fine actor in many good movies must have been aware that he was physically and type wise so miscast that he did not even attempt at playing the Rochester of the novel His Rochester besides being blond and blue eyed is a soft spoken well mannered nobleman shy and quiet slightly queer and eccentric but basically good natured and mild He is so far from being irascible moody and grim that lines referring to these traits of his character sound absolutely ridiculous Additionally during many moments of the movie Hurt s facial expression leaves one wondering if he is fighting against acute attacks of the sleeping sickness Particularly in the proposal scene he grimaces like a patient rallying from a general anaesthetic and is hardly able to keep his eyes open If you compare his Rochester to the strong willed and charming protagonist of the novel simply bursting with energy and temperament it is no wonder that many viewers are disappointed in Hurt s performance Still he offends me less than the Rochesters in the 70 97 and 2006 versions and I would in general rank this Jane Eyre higher than these three other ones Hurt obviously had the wits to recognise that he could not be the Rochester of the novel and therefore did not try to do so whereas George C Scott Ciaràn Hinds and Toby Stephens thought they could but failed miserably and I d rather watch a character other than Rochester than a Rochester who is badly played And I d rather watch a Jane Eyre movie which leaves out many lines of the novel but does not invent new ones than a version which uses modernised dialogues which sound as if they could be uttered by a today s couple in a Starbucks café Of course this Jane Eyre is a failure but at least it is an inoffensive one which is more than one can say of the 97 and 2006 adaptations I would therefore not desist anyone from watching this adaptation You will not find Jane Eyre but at least you will find a beautifully made movie
Having read the novel before seeing this film I was enormously disappointed by the wooden acting and the arrogance of the producers in their blatant disregard of the plot I feel this film in no way reflects the brilliance of Bronte s work and rather gave the impression of a shallow love story In the condensing of the film to a short 2hours the film lost many of the key features which make the book comprehendable and progressional thus resulting in a somewhat jumpy plot with little grounding There is no build up to the romance between Rochester and Jane Eyre so this appears rather abrupt and unfounded since the two characters have such infrequent interaction you cannot help but imagine their love is superficial This is such an injustice to Bronte s novel you are given no impression of Jane s quirky cheek and boldness which attracts Rochester to her and his arrogance which attracts Jane to him br br Despite to poor scripting I think that a few of the characters were portrayed very astutely namely Mrs Fairfax and Grace Poole however overall the production was poor Given a better scripting perhaps the film would have been more successful See Jane Eyre 1970 with Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton for an outstanding production
I agree with one of the other comment writers about good story good actors but mismatched and I would also say rushed It has been about 24years since I read the book as it was in school But I felt that you would need to know the story of Jane Eyre when watching this one as bits are left out therefore it doesn t fully make sense For example Jane Mr Rochester have hardly spoken suddenly he is proposing marriage The actors don t have time to let the audience know how their character feels about each thing happening in the story The actors are good but aren t given enough time to do this story justice I m sorry to say it but I didn t really enjoy this version The 1970 version with Susanna York George C Scott would be the Jane Eyre movie of my preference BUT you should check out the 1983 BBC mini series version with Zelah Clarke Timothy Dalton in the 2 main roles I love it so much I watch it regularly There is an abridged version which goes for 225mins or the full version for 330mins
What was Franco Zeffirelli thinking Was Hollywood responsible for this travesty or can I take comfort in the idea that someone who didn t speak English as a first language just completely missed the point of Charlotte Bronte s classic I don t think I can improve on a comment I read below so I ll just paraphrase it Jane Eyre is a great great book the screenwriter should read it sometime It s true that this movie s two leads were sadly miscast But pity the actors because the screenwriter left out all of the best scenes The dialog that makes you understand the Jane and Rochester have a meeting of minds and a shared sense of fun deleted from the script The marriage proposal the fortune teller gone The allusions half joking half sincerely felt to Jane as a fairy sprite from olde England come to rescue Rochester in his despair eliminated br br It is unfortunate that Zeffirelli felt the need to completely rewrite the end of the novel and Jane s interactions with the Rivers family But it is unforgivable that he has surgically removed the love from one of the best love stories ever written br br Do yourself a favor and go find the 1983 mini series with Timothy Dalton
I read the novel Jane Eyre for the first time back in 1986 It was round that time that I saw the BBC version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke It was an excellent version and very much like the book Years later I laid eyes on this version and was horrified William Hurt is totally miscast as Mr Rochester Mr Rochester is a passionate character where as William Hurt portrays him as a block of ice The same goes for Charlotte Gainsborough It was like watching two zombies together This is story about love and passion but I couldn t see it in this version No back to the BBC version A wonderful time is guaranteed
Jane Eyre_ is one of the greatest novels in the English language and this screenwriter should of read it I hate it when writers use Spark notes for what a novel is all about This movie is unbearable to watch if you have read the book br br The whole red room is so down played that I wonder why they even bother to put it in In the book the red room is foreshadowing for the WHOLE story and the rest of Jane s life Helen Burns is treated so badly in the movie I m sure she was happy to die and leave early In the book she is one of the most compelling characters and she was not the red head The whole Christian theme is missing from her life and the rest of the movie br br Do yourself a favor and miss this movie and read the story as Charlotte Bronte masterfully told it
I don t like using the word awful to describe any work of the cinema for which a great deal of time effort talent and money is spent in its creation but Zefferelli s attempt to adapt Charlotte Brontë s novel Jane Eyre is a total waste of time br br The script is lacking in finesse and power everything explained to the viewer in no uncertain terms leaving little to the imagination The lead actors are woefully miscast clearly hired for their star names and the musical score drippy and dull Charlotte Gainsbourg and William Hurt have absolutely no chemistry with one another at all She is like a wet noodle worse even than Joan Fontaine who at least was capable of some modicum of emotional involvement in what should be a story of frustrated passion And William Hurt acts the entire film on one tone and that tone is flat and devoid of energy Of course the limp and vapid script does not aid any of these otherwise fine actors in their efforts to bring any whiff of life to this flick br br Joan Plowright s Mrs Fairfax is like some Disney creation who keeps popping up to sweeten scenes in which she would have been best left out br br There is no mystery surrounding the story of Rochester s first wife The role of the would be second wife played like a Barbie Doll by Elle MacPhearson is an empty cipher br br Fiona Shaw a very great actress is completely wasted as Jane s Aunt Mrs Reed She would have been better cast as Mrs Fairfax Only Amanda Root as Jane s beloved school teacher evokes any authentic sympathy or believability br br I saw this version of Jane Eyre after viewing Robert Young s for British television made in 1997 starring Ciaran Hinds Samantha Morgan and Gemma Jones There is no comparison Young s vital romantic and deeply moving version is like an exploding nova compared to Zefferelli s wet squib br br I will be interested now to see the 1970 version with Timothy Dalton about which I ve read some very good things on this web site I am amazed at how many people liked Zefferelli s Yorkshire picture book br br About all I can say good about this film is that the house is beautiful and the cinematography vividly colored beyond that it is a complete dud
This version is pretty insipid I m afraid Jane Eyre is one of my favorite books and has been since childhood but William Hurt s weary throwaway acting style is completely unsuitable to the bold passion of Edward Rochester and poor Charlotte Gainsbrough looks like a bored petulant teenager whose dental braces hurt I also can t believe that they eliminated Edward s great marriage proposal scene from the end of the book one of the most moving moments in literature I do appreciate that they finally used such a young plain woman to play Jane a character who is supposed to be a worldly 18 but if you want to see a version that closer approximates the personalities and passions of the novel please see the 70 s version with George C Scott and Susannah York York was too old tall and pretty to play Jane but no one has touched Rochester s character the way that Scott did
What made the idea of seeing this movie so attractive was the hope that it would live up to Charlotte Bronte s brilliance of the original classic story I was deeply disappointed to find that this movie which seemed to be either written or filmed in great haste had not the qualities that made the original novel so powerful Much of the witty back and forth between the main characters Jane Eyre and Mr Rochester seemed to be either missing from the screenplay or left on the cutting room floor Also missing was Jane Eyre s charismatic sense of self which enabled her to suffer through her turmoil and triumph over all The original Jane Eyre was a hero The woman in this movie did not seem to have much to triumph over including one of the greatest parts of the story when Jane runs away from Thornfield and Mr Rochester Her struggle to find food and shelter her shame at having to beg for bread the threat of freezing to death in the cold all to get away from a man she loved were in my opinion poignant parts of the story that were simply left out of this movie The title character seemed dry and uninspired The story was unappealing and for those who did not read the book I cannot imagine that this story would be the least bit interesting The screenplay and Direction did little if any credit to the classic story
I can t say this is the worst film of all time but only because there are still some movies I haven t seen yet This has to be the most pretentious attempt at making a movie of all time The director suffers from the same issues he had with There Will Be Blood though he wasn t quite as bad in that film The whole movie it feels like you re watching a guy trying to hard to impress beyond his abilities It s like he sits in his little director s chair and thinks how would a great filmmaker handle this scene He just doesn t have it in him I don t know if this film could be saved by a great filmmaker There were certainly some nuggets of greatness that could have been polished but nothing was brought to ripen The scene where all the characters are singing was the worst moment in cinema history One by one as we see the characters singing and I squirmed in my seat I kept saying please PLEASE just don t have the guy on the brink of death singing too Sure enough MASSIVE FAILURE
This ambitious film suffers most from writer director Paul Thomas Anderson s delusions of grandeur Highly derivative of much better material Altman s Nashville Lumet s Network this lumbering elephant takes far too long to get nowhere A couple of misguided detours along the way an embarrassing musical interlude a biblical plague don t help matters Neither does the uneven level of performances Especially bad William H Macy whose character and storyline could easily have been eliminated altogether Julianne Moore for her unconvincing angst And how many times must we see John C Reilly s Sad Sack shtick Chicago and The Hours will suffice Tom Cruise comes off well by comparison his misogynist foul mouthed Holy Roller was rather amusing Speaking of foul mouths the script was so loaded with F bombs they lost their impact in no time Don t even talk about that awful soundtrack full of insipid and annoying vocals by Aimee Mann Her extended rendition of One a maudlin number to begin with drove me to distraction at the start of the film I should have heeded the handwriting on the wall and saved myself three more hours by which time I d been pushed to the brink of hell One redeeming feature which I haven t seen mentioned in other reviews is the best performance in the bunch by unknown Melora Walters in the role of Claudia the damaged coke fiend bent on self destruction Her credibility exceeded all others by far This film took itself way too seriously and just didn t know when to end
That s not just my considered verdict on this film but also on the bulk of what has been written about it Now don t get me wrong here either I m not a total philistine I didn t hate the movie because it wasn t enough like police academy 9 or whatever I enjoy more than my fair share of high brow or arty stuff I swear br br Magnolia is poor and I am honestly mystified as to why it is seemingly so acclaimed Long winded self indulgent rambling nonsense from start to finish there is just so little that could credibly be what people so love about the movie There s some high calibre actors fair enough and none turns in an average or worse performance Furthermore my wife a self confessed Tom Cruise hater tells me it s his career best performance by far But the plot is so completely unengaging meandering between the stories of several loosely connected characters at such a snail s pace that even when significant life changing events are depicted they seem so pointless and uninteresting you find yourself crying out for someone to get blown up or something br br It doesn t help that none of the characters are very easy to identify or empathise with well I didn t think so but I don t like most people admittedly They all play out their rather unentertaining life stories at great length demonstrating their character flaws and emotions in ever so intricate detail and playing out their deep and meaningful relationships to the nth degree with many a waffling soliloquy en route Yadda yadda yadda The soundtrack s dire as well with that marrow suckingly irritating quality that I had hitherto thought unique to the music of Alanis Morisette br br All in all it was about as enjoyable a three hours as being forced to repeatedly watch an episode of Friends whilst being intermittently poked in the ribs by a disgruntled nanny goat The bit with the frogs is good though
Magnolia presents itself as a wall to wall canvas of screaming shrieking overwrought hysterical twits who are all bedeviled by regret guilt and pain PT Anderson is certainly a gifted filmmaker but perhaps he should leave the writing to someone else or at least find someone with the balls to tell him he needed to edit this overlong mess br br A look at the cast will tell you that the performances were excellent and they were I just wish that every scene didn t involve an over the top shouting match or long digression into the sins that have been committed and the pain that they have caused br br I also think that Anderson fails miserably to create a story that parallels the bizarre tableaus that open the film The opening sequences are wonderful in showing how fate can bring together people and circumstances that even the most optimistic believer in a cosmic puppeteer pulling our strings would scoff at But the story that then develops lacks any of the stuff that these opening fables display I kept waiting for some form of cosmic convergence to display itself but instead all we get is waves of regret from morally challenged characters who see their past spread out before them and now seek absolution Throw in an out of left field biblical plague near the end and all you end up with is a cadre of Anderson devotees who will marvel at his genius when all it really proves is that he has actually read the Old Testament br br I will say that the music by Aimee Mann was great and I ll be looking for the Soundtrack CD In short a good movie to look at and listen to the music that is if the actors would have shut up or toned it down it may have been
1999 will go down in history as the year the movie critic lead the general public astray First they sent us to EYES WIDE SHUT Then they hyped up THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and now MAGNOLIA which is by far the worst movie of the year What is it about Who the heck knows Its full of self indulgence and loaded with bad acting I always like to stay and watch the credits but when this thing was over I couldn t get out of the movie theatre fast enough Most of the audience that attended the showing that I was at felt pretty much the same way Dates were arguing with each other as well as strangers It s an ugly and hateful film that will make you feel ugly and hateful
My guess is that this director writer had something to say Let s see what it could have been a Frog storms would be creepy b can I get someone like Tom Cruise to say the C word many times and look like a bad Patrick Rafter c Cast my wife and get her to say the F word every 2 seconds This aside I really liked the beginning and the frog storm The rest was a relentless over long under edited over indulgent failure Glad so many of you enjoyed it br br
Normally I dont have a problem with gratuitous swearing in films but this one really annoyed me All they did was swear For the whole film And as someone else noted get cancer It was boring rambling and pretentious I wouldnt If I were you br br Its also not that I dont like films which as most people who like it will claim observe life I love Eat Drink Man Woman and all that happens in that is that a load of Taiwanese people lead their lives But I could relate to them I have never met anyone who swore as much as the actors in this film and I used to work on a construction site So go figure Having said that William H Macy made me grin Once br br 2 10 Avoid unless you enjoy tedium
I wanted to like Magnolia The plot reminded me of Grand Canyon which I liked 4 different lives stories that come together at the end but Magnolia took a wrong turn halfway through the movie and I was lost I almost turned it off right then and there but I felt I should hang in there until the end little did I know it would be another torturous 1 1 2 hours Thank god I rented instead of seeing it in the theatre I almost screamed out in frustration after 2 hours The biggest kick in the pants was the ending frog scene My DVD player still hasn t forgiven me and I don t blame it one bit It was a unique movie but a bad boring and pointless movie
Sorry did i miss something did i walk out early The first ten minutes of unusual and untrue stories had me thinking This is going to be a classic But it was all down hill from there The acting was brilliant for what it s worth William H Macy is fantastic and just gets better and better every film i watch him in But it never seemed to connect I was waiting for the big moment where all the stories inter connect and then suddenly it rains frog it was if the writer said i ve gone to deep how can i pull all these stories together cleverely Oh sod it i ll just have it raining frogs I like clever movies i like strange movies but this was just odd and boring 4 10
Great cast Great acting Unpredictable story line for the first half br br hour or so I was really wanting to know what was going to br br happen to each of these unredeeming characters and how their br br seemingly disparate lives would become intertwined But when br br the writers took out the glue to start connecting the players they br br mistakenly used super glue and brought the movie to a standstill br br for the last two hours I kept thinking it would get better but it only br br got worse Don t believe the reviews This is a waste of time br br Think about it Tom Cruise made ugly why The gorgeous br br hunky bartender wearing braces why I know it had to do with br br the plot but without them at least there would have been one br br attractive cast member to remember
Magnolia is a preposterous bewildering acting showcase that adds up to very little Like Eyes Wide Shut Magnolia is an aimless series of episodes without any concern for coherence The camera swoops through hallways and corridors catching glimpses of sad characters Where is the reason to care for these people The common theme seems to be people who yell a lot who can t care for others except for John C Reilly s and Philip Seymour Hoffman s characters and are self destructive jerks who are either falling to pieces or dying I was reminded of how much I disliked Shine because of the irredeemable monster of a father played by Armin Mueller Stahl There are so many unattractive unappealing characters here why would we want to spend time with them br br Having said that there is nothing held back about Magnolia Paul Thomas Anderson s ideas are splashed onto his canvas with abandon There are two ideas in particular that bomb Both happen in the last hour of this 188 minute film One has the camera flipping from one character to another while each one sings one of Aimee Mann s coffeehouse folk songs Sweet but ineffectual since we can t see what strings them all together The other idea I refer to cannot be revealed other than to say it is completely unexpected and completely ridiculous br br Magnolia has a lot of great acting Particularly Tom Cruise who unleashes a performance I didn t know he had in him And John C Reilly plays maybe the most decent and truly good cop in recent memory But it all adds up to nothing When the secret unexpected event happened a girl behind me in the theatre couldn t hold it in any more and said This is stupid My feeling is the majority of moviegoers will agree
I can t tell you how angry I was after seing this movie The characters are not the slightest bit interesting and the plot is non existant So after waiting to see how the lives of these characters affected each other hoping that the past 2 and a half hours were leading up to some significant finish what do we get A storm of frogs Now yes I understand the references to the bible Exodus and the underlying theme but first of all it was presented with absolutely no resolution and second of all it would be lost to anyone who has not read the bible a significant portion of the population or Charles Fort a still larger portion As a somewhat well read person I thought this movie was a self indulgent poor imitation of a seinfeld episode br br Don t waste your time It would be better spent reading br br well anything to be honest
The minute you give an art film 1 10 you have people baying for your ignorant half ass ed artistically retarded blood I won t try and justify how I am not an aesthetically challenged retard by listing out all the art house cinema I have liked or mentioning how I gave some unknown cult classic a 10 10 All I ask is that someone explain to me the point purpose and message of this film br br Here is how I would summarize the film Opening montage of three unrelated urban legends depicting almost absurd levels of co incidence This followed by in a nutshell to save you 3 hours of pain the following A children s game show host dying of lung cancer tries to patch things up with his coke addicted daughter who he may or may not have raped when she was a child and who is being courted by a bumbling police officer with relationship issues while the game show s star contestant decides that he doesn t want to be a failed child prodigy a fate which has befallen another one of the game show contestants from the 60s who we see is now a jobless homosexual in love with a bartender with braces and in need of money for corrective oral surgery while the game show s producer himself dying of lung cancer asks his male nurse to help him patch up with the son he abandoned years ago and who has subsequently become a womanizing self help guru even as Mr Producer s second wife suffers from guilt pangs over having cheated a dying man and oh eventually it rains frogs You read correctly And I am sparing you the unbelievably long and pointless literally rambling monologues each character seems to come up with on the fly for no rhyme or reason other than possibly to make sure the film crosses 3 hours and becomes classified as a modern epic br br You are probably thinking that I could have done a better job of summarizing the movie and in turn of not confusing you if I had written the damn thing a little more coherently maybe in a few sentences instead of just one Well now you know how I feel
This was shown on the biography channel and was about as informative as a children s comic I gave it 2 out of 10 for it s attention to detail because for the most part it had a 70s feel to it and the three ladies that played the original three angels looked like them so the make up was good br br This was supposed to be a biography on the biography channel but it was void of everything that is normally usually seen in one of their biographies No interviews with surviving cast members crew members production team members etc or their friends families and any biographers of those people In fact I know just as much now about the programme as I did before I watched this film that was based on the supposedly biographical book As for actually learning something that no one knew about the program and wasn t common knowledge well that never happened
I happened to love the show growing up along with millions of others So I tuned in to this movie thinking if not good it might be at least a bit dazzling and fun br br WRONG I just have to wonder at the end of this was Charlie s Angels really that boring I don t seem to remember it as such But this movie as bad as movies of this type can be bore little resemblance to the excitement of that time period and show I did see it all in spite of the negatives it wasn t unwatchable But it was very bland which I do not fault the performers for at all particularly the women who played the angels as they really did look like them The movie just wasn t that interesting It tried to make each angel a character One angel is to feisty one is the good girl one is to into her husband all characters were portrayed with one major characteristic defining them and little depth beyond stereotypes The excitement of the show was missing and the dialog was dialog That s pretty much it br br Not awful Not the worst of TV movies But missable
It was everything this isn t it had pace pop and actors who weren t afraid to chew the scenery It also had a decent script This one had me scratching my head If Farrah isn t really serious about a career why does she have a manager and why is he wasting his time If Kate and Barney are artists why do they sign up for The Mother of All Jiggle Shows like the Brady Bunch movie where Robert Reed wants to do Shakespeare only to find himself on BB They weren t industry names but they weren t exactly starving either And while they got the history right the poster was released before Farrah got the show Silverman rejecting pitches for Funniest Home Videos and American Idol and Spelling promising his baby girl Tori someday he ll create a show for her obviously did not happen br br What bothered me was how Spelling s role is distorted He s shown as the show runner and creator when he was neither And how he comes up with the idea for CA was is laughable br br How were Spelling and Goldberg allowed to enforce Farrah s oral contract when the others were signed And why didn t Farrah or Bernstein tell them she was leaving not because she discovered her Inner Diva but because Majors wanted her to This is why when it tries tries to created conflict and tension by setting Farrah up as the bad girl like Suzanne Somers it fails because the groundwork was never laid that was where the Three s Company pic delivered
Noting the cast I recently watched this movie on TCM hoping for an under appreciated gem as I regard many films from the 30 s This is no gem not even semi precious The anachronistic clothing and 1930 s Rolls Royce limo hit you immediately The casting is strange also But mostly there are too many dumb and unnecessary plot devices This film has lots of good ingredients and a basic plot that holds promise but the components aren t mixed according to the right recipe It simply doesn t come together like it should And that s a shame WIth a few rather obvious but minor alterations this might have been a very good movie br br The film is about an American showgirl Jean Harlow seeking a rich British husband preferably from the nobility She meets Franchot Tone and his buddy who are on a lark in a Rolls Royce owned by his buddy s employer Harlow mistakenly assumes Tone is the Lord who owns the Rolls and she sets her sights on him This early part of the film is a light comedy of no real distinction br br However Tone unwittingly uncovers the fact that his employer is actually a German 5th columnist on the eve of WWI and that is when the movie changes tone altogether and begins to fall apart Tone and Harlow are married but just as the honeymoon begins he is gunned down by a Mata Hari type Benita Hume and Harlow flees the scene with a bystander accusing her of Tone s murder In fact Tone recovers from the wounds br br Harlow flees to France where she falls in love again this time with a wealthy French cad Cary Grant Tone now in the army and Harlow are unexpectedly brought back together in Grant s hospital room where he is in rehab from a plane crash In the following scene Tone accuses Harlow of abandoning him because she is essentially a gold digger Harlow never explains about the witness accusing her of murder and her panic That is one of those unreal movie plot device break downs in the story br br Then Tone is also brought back into contact with the woman Hume who shot him She is on hand to watch her paramour Grant test the new plane that Tone has delivered to him from England Incredibly both Hume and Tone dimly recognize each other but simply can t place where from Okay so Tone was shot and almost died perhaps his memory is a little out of whack But how many men did Hume shoot that she would forget one of her marks She does not seem to be faking the memory lapse br br This is inexplicable and unnecessary Hume should have absolutely recognized him but played it coy when she realized that Tone wasn t able to place her That would have been a much better treatment of that issue br br The finale also is very unsatisfying The movie as made has Tone and Harlow conspiring to preserve the good reputation of the cad Grant leading to his fraudulent burial as a hero Then Harlow and Tone just walk away It is noble to preserve the French public s perception of their national war hero but very unsatisfying as a love story br br What the film begs for is this Harlow explains that she fled in a panic in the face of accusations of murder Tone forgives her and quietly rekindles his love for her he then carries a torch for her even while helping her to rig the crash site to preserve Grant s reputation Meanwhile Harlow finally recognizes Grant for the cad he is Then having seen Tone for the brave and noble man he is Harlow rekindles feelings for him too At film s end the two of them become reconciled even as they work together to rig the appearance of Grant s death After Grant s hero s burial we see them embrace and kiss at the fade out That would have made a nice little movie For Cary Grant fans it would have been even better had Tone played the French cad who is killed and Grant the long suffering first husband reunited with Harlow br br It is incomprehensible that Franchot Tone is cast as the Irishman living in England while Cary Grant is cast as the Frenchman This movie would have been much better had they reversed roles That also would have been more conducive to the film that should have been
This may have been made for the hell of it but it was most probably the worst film i ve seen in years The best thing about the entire DVD would be the case I m surprised that people took the time to make something so rubbish and yet spend money on it too I m glad i only rented I suppose the real fans of this film would probably have to be sadistic and Gothic to care about it without taking in any CGI or any other effects for that matter I hope Alex Chandon learnt a lesson about lighting and SFX to make a better film in the future that is if he is still in work br br Notes to buyers this is extremely disappointing DON T BUY IT
Sadly this is not the best British gore film since hellraiser though the DVD cover claims this which is what tricked me into buying it It is however an homage to many of the great horrors of old films from most notably the Amicus stable br br Cradle is shot on mini dv which though we all know has more of a TV feel than a movie can be done so much better Every scene set and shot looks like it has been lit in exactly the same way standard key fill rear setup which only enhances the cheap look of the finished piece The gore content is quite frankly laughable From the opening shots where we see a man s obviously foam rubber head torn apart through to tacky cheap prop hammers the creature effects and the terrible cg there was nothing in there that impressed me at all br br The acting is abominable from the near comatose detective to the brummie dwarf via Dani Filth the least convincing horror movie bad guy I have ever witnessed Each of the substories is more formulaic than the last and the sets get worse and worse as the movie runs Look out for the Mental Asylum a Georgian semi detached house with a bad cg sign outside and the most bizarre and not in a good way padded cell I have seen br br It took me four attempts to get to the end of the film without my attention wandering nay running away at any available opportunity I actually found myself dusting at one point while the film was running br br It does however mark one of the last known appearances of Emily Booth s breasts which I guess is one um two things it has going for it Once that s out of the way though it is all downhill br br I ve heard people say good things about Alex Chandon and I would love to believe them but on this evidence I m not likely to If you want a decent homage to Amicus avoid this and go for the League of Gentlemen Christmas special instead br br Currently battling it out with Blair Witch 2 Book of Shadows for the title of worst film I have ever seen
It SURPRISINGLY had a plot I ve seen movies with less plot I don t wanna mention Asian movies but I thought the camera wasn t bad at all for a cheap movie like this and also the atmosphere wasn t too bad There is no real reason for most things people do and the way they react to what happens Although I do think that about a lot of movies in this case it was horrible of course br br It ripped off some movies SO badly just for single scenes The acting was bad but I ve seen worse The movie was bad but I ve seen worse Watching this film is an experience between boredom laughing fits death wish sadism horniness and entertainment on a low level br br So if you like gory movies with stupid plots this one is the right film for you br br I gave it 3 10 because it CAN be entertaining if you don t expect to see a good movie and you re in the right mood
Not since Caligula have I considered turning off the movie half way through but then with this one I was only 15 minutes in when I considered Unfortunately I did make it all the way through Make sure that you do not br br It s not that Cradle of Fear is shocking or gory or scary or frightening or sexual It s that it s not any of those things yet it so desperately wants to be all of them Instead it s boring trite ordinary predictable and unexceptionally poorly executed shot on video high school special effects no sense of even basic visual storytelling dialog barely audible not that it s worth hearing though br br This movie is proof for the argument that even the straight to video distributors need to draw a line in the sand somewhere
The directors cut version which was the one I saw was very long for this type of movie Almost two hours is way too long If you have the choice definitely go for the non directors cut br br The main plot is almost not taken up at all the movie consists to the main part of several murder scenes which are connected but the feeling is that they re only shown in order to fill the movie with splatterish violence The connection is not revealed until the latter part and the lack of context bored me out long before I was there br br As a horror movie it doesn t work You never get the required feel for the characters due to mediocre acting and the general disposition character is presented 15 minutes later character is dead This pictures strong side lies in the splatter part
By all accounts this could have been an interesting film Featuring a score by the mighty Cradle Of Filth starring their frontman Dani and being hyped up as the future of British horror I expected Alex Chandon s gore fest to live up to the hype br br I was wrong br br Everything about this film is either cliche or inept The short story anthology setup was done to death and much better in the seventies and eighties Admittedly the idea of the sick room did send a chill down my spine but as with most of the film was let down by bad script writing and acting br br Chandon cannot write dialogue Every sentence with the main police investigator is brim full with swearing and insolence the typical cop on the edge formula funny i m sure i ve seen that somewhere else before No Chandon you are not Tarantino Or Scorsese It sounds BAD Add ludicrously OTT acting with very dodgy casting don t get me wrong Dani Filth is a great singer and musician but actor he ain t and the performances are beyond laughable to the vein burstingly cringing Give me Bruce Campbell any day br br The visual effects are on the whole poor with some atrocious CGI awful gore effects for goodness sakes Peter Jackson did better and that was over ten years ago with less budget and editing filters that shriek OVER USE As for the often mistimed use of Cradle Of Filth s score man they should sue br br The fundamental problem with Cradle Of Fear is that it takes itself seriously trying to build atmosphere and incite terror and repulsion within its audience too many good horror films made in the seventies and eighties do this so much better with far superior gore effects eg maniac zombie flesh eaters the beyond suspiria etc rendering Cradle of Fear in my mind second rate and obsolete br br I hope Chandon can learn from this hideous ghoul of a film and go on to make some quality horror that actually scares br br Better luck next time
Normally when I go on a raid of the local Hollywood Video I head towards the B Horror movies To me the basic principals behind a B Horror movie is it s camp value Heavy Gore Lots of needless Nudity and special effects that anyone can put together with a pack of corn syrup and latex I rented Cradle of Fear strictly because I ve been a fan of the band since they released they re first Demo in 1995 The movie started off on an interesting note and then when I saw Dani Filth stomp on an extremely obvious latex mask I LAUGHED When I saw the Lesbian sex scene for the sake of a Lesbian sex scene I LAUGHED EVEN HARDER I spent pretty much the entire movie laughing and when I wasn t laughing I was shaking my head thinking about how a multi million dollar rock star would want to make a movie that seemed like it was on a budget of multi hundreds of dollars The whole point of this movie to me seemed to attract the Hardcore Goth kids who think death destruction sex blood and Satan are the greatest things invented since Lava Lamps That was really it To me this movie seemed like 80 5 of the things that happened in this movie just happened for the sake of being Satanic This movie had a lot of potential and really could have been a real good movie but in the end this Movie really is just an extended Cradle of Filth Video
This movie has a few things going for it right off the bat Having Dani Filth as a lead actor is automatically going to make some people like this movie Admittedly I love Cradle of Filth and listened to the soundtrack to this movie long before I watched it Dani Filth is a very recognizable character and makes for a great lead The independent filming style of the movie is great for the creepy factor There are some GORGEOUS actresses in this movie For being low budget the special effects weren t bad either The ways that people died were very creative and nightmarish br br Now on to the cons There is VERY little talking throughout this whole movie thus making for very little as far as character development It s hard to fear for the lives of limp static characters When there was a little talking the F bomb was abundant popping up in random places Yes I understand people swear but it seems like a preteen boy scripted this and thought himself cool for including all the language The storyline what I could make out of it was pretty good although many parts are left dangling and the lack of conversation leaves one often wondering what s happening br br In the end Cradle of Fear is like a porno for people who love sex and violence but like a porno trying to pull of a storyline it just doesn t work too well Rent it though if you re a morbid person looking to sate your blood and flesh appetite
This movie was made for fans of Dani and Cradle of Filth I am not one of them I think he s just an imitator riding the black metal bandwagon still I m generally not a fan of black metal But as I was carrying this DVD case to pay for it I convinced myself that the less authentic something is the more it tries to be convincing Thus I assumed I m in for a roller coaster ride of rubber gore and do it yourself splatter with a sinister background Now that is what I do like br br I got home and popped it in My patience lasted 15 minutes AWFUL camera work and DISGUSTING quality And that was then 2002 that it looked like it was shot using a Hi8 camcorder I left it on the shelf Maybe a nice evening with beer and Bmovies would create a nice setting for this picture br br After a couple of months I got back to it in mentioned surroundings and saw half Then not only the mentioned aspects annoyed me My disliking evolved I noticed how funny Dani 1 65m 5 5 height looked in his platform shoes ripping a head of a mugger apart Yes ripping His head apparently had no skull I also found that this movie may have no sense Still I haven t finished it yet so I wasn t positive br br After a couple more tries I finally managed to finish this flick a couple of months back Yes it took me 5 5 years So Dani in fact was funny as Satan Manson super evil man s HELPER and the movie DID NOT make sense See our bad person employs Dani to do bad things He delivers Why Well I guess he s just very very bad As a matter of fact they both are and that is pretty much it br br We have a couple of short stories joined by Dani s character My favourite was about a guy who STEALS SOMEONE S LEG because he wants to use it as his own Yeah exactly br br The acting s ROCK BOTTOM The CGI is the worst ever I mean Stinger beats it and boy is Stinger s CGI baaaaad The story has no sense And the quality is Let s just say it is not satisfying The only thing that might keep you watching is the unmotivated violence and gore Blood and guts are made pretty well Why you can actually see that the movie originated there and then moved on Example Dani The Man Filth takes a stuffed cat fake as can be and guts it and then eats what fell out Why We never know We do know however that this cat must have been on illegal substances as his heart is almost half his size br br You might think after my comment that this movie is so bad it s good but it s just bad Cradle of Filth fans can add 3 points I added one for gore
This film is a very funny film The violence is bad the acting is Well Dani stick to singing or screaming or whatever the hell it is you usually do The random chicks wearing hardly anything is just to catch sexually frustrated goth lads in Personally i think this movie really does suck The story and characters COULD be very good if say the directing the actors and other little nibby things were made better But the film is just bad the only reason why people like this piece of crap is because it has Danni in it This film is possibly the worst B rate film ever And believe me that s hard to achieve especially when you re competing with Def by Temptation and over crappy excuses for serious horror movies I m not a CoF fan and so i just see this as another rubbish movie A really bad one If Dani made this as a comedy then good going him Very well done Over than that though i rate it low for it s crappiness Watch it when you re in a happy happy joy joy mode so you can laugh at everything or if you re high on multiple different types of drugs
and you can look at that statement in different ways by the way First of all it s a mess because of all the gruesome and extremely violent scenes Your wildest imagination doesn t even come close to some of the explicitly shown scenes here Entire parts of this movie are just plain sick disgusting offensive brutal and they bring you close to puking your guts out Now I love horror movies and I am very pro violence but I do think that it has to lead somewhere Is that too much to ask Cradle of Fear is just a series of utterly sick and twisted thoughts The movie contains out of four separate chapters connected by a wraparound story This results in endless showing of torture murder and sickness only to find out that the victims have something in common Not very informative if you ask me And yet it has to be said the basic plot idea surely HAS potential It s about a cannibalistic hypnotist who made a deal with the devil himself to avenge himself and cause misery and death to everyone who was involved in his trial Personally I think that is an interesting topic so they should have focused on that a little more instead of wanting to create the most disgusting movie ever br br Secondly the whole production of this movie was a mess They didn t have much of a budget and they spent it all on fake blood and guts Tons of it The acting performances are a joke and some of the worst I ve ever seen Any other special effects besides the make up looks very amateurish Like that attempt to a realistic car crash for example There s no tension or atmosphere to detect anywhere not even an attempt to build up one br br Cradle of Fear is a failure and a missed opportunity to say the least With the presence of death metal icon Danni Filth from the band Cradle of filth get the link this movie is obviously only meant for the eyes of twisted teenagers who try to be controversial Troubled girls and boys who take pleasure in worrying their parents by watching crap like this And then people keep complaining that the amount of suicides and juvenile delinquency is increasing Bah I can imagine that this movie can cause a lot of damage when you re easily influenced or dispose of an unstable mind For every self respecting horror fan this movie is an insult
Cradle of Fear br br This isn t a movie where intricate delicate little narrative nuances occupy our attention This is not a film where the special effects are supposed to leave us slack jacked uttering that sense of whoa What it is though is a slice of lo fi goth horror which leaves little to the imagination created in the eyes of the director Alex Chandon as a throwback to sleazy 70s and 80s horror br br This is a very visceral experience for 2 hours where four plot lines are connected through lots of watery blood reams of dismembered body parts and innards tied by an intestinal thread of revenge br br The purveyor of such horrific violence is Dani Filth lead singer of the metal band Cradle of Filth executing a role he was destined to play br br As other s have said there is nothing new about wanting to carryout occultist revenge In this particular context a convicted sexual predator and murderer Kemper the father of our devilish avenging angel compels his son to exact retribution on those who are some how connected to convicting him to purgatory within an insane asylum br br What this provides for the Chandon who should be congratulated on also penning and editing this piece is the opportunity to let his sick mind run free He seems to take delight in the idea of splattering blood into the orifices of those on screen and into every nook and cranny that can be reached We are also treated to close ups of skull s being crushed demonic rape and other assorted imagery to engage those who relish getting up close and personal to their horror And for some of those who closely follow these type of films there is the odd sequence which may have you thinking Did I just see what I thought I did because of course Pretty Woman this aint It reminds me of some of the gore fests created out of Italian horror some 20 to 30 years ago and a number of other works where disgusting images have left their mark but not the context in which they were viewed br br Story 4 of the set is particularly intriguing where the idea of ones obsession can ultimately lead to death in the pursuit of internet violence through the Sick Room where the user is in control of how a life can be snuffed out Further acknowledgements should also go out to a pounding soundtrack that allows Filth to exercise his daytime talent and an effective use of drum and bass often overlooked in film making as a viable form of supporting visuals Using the city of London as a backdrop with real people as opposed to movie stand ins also adds support to the commando feel of the film OK classic it may not be but blood guts intestines occult and demons in a slightly perverse unproblematic way it is
This sure is one comedy I m not likely to forget for a while br br Wouldn t normally bother to comment on this movie it s so minor that no one would watch it anyway but as it happens it s kind of popular in p2p sharing networks such as Kazaa and so this saaad production needs to be exposed for what it is br br So what is it then Well of course it s not really a comedy instead it s intended as a horror flick intended very much being the key word here The script is a totally incoherent and unbalanced mess the special effects are only special in that they re especially pathetic and as for the acting well let s just say that if this had been my graduating play at primary school my teachers would have burst out crying at our talent br br Of course I realise that this is a very low budget film and that in those cases one should lower one s expectations certainly as far as things like special effects are concerned Also even though I m a big fan of the horror genre I m aware that these movies are only rarely the places to look for interesting scripts and top notch acting br br But still br br B movies often have some redeeming features to make up for the lack of funding such as humour The only laughs in Cradle to Fear lie in the ridiculous performances If you can find the humour in that and I could for the first 20 minutes or so gradually dozing off after that then that s going to be the only thing the movie has to offer Oh that and two or three pairs of breasts br br Woohoo how exciting br br As for the story it s not even that it doesn t try to convey anything the victims either use drugs and or are involved in serious crime The lesson Watch out naughty boys and girls because one day you ll be made to pay for what you ve done br br I rest my case br br So all in all a little bit of sex a fair amount of drugs but absolutely zero rock n roll br br I rate this one 1 out of 10 but would go to 0 if I could Or perhaps I wouldn t it deserves a 1 for spelling the actors names correctly in the titles I mean that s something innit
Now look I won t lie to you but I only got this movie for 3 99 from a friend because it had Danni Filth the lead singer of the ever popular death metal band Cradle Of Filth in it I expected of course violence and gore at its finest as that is what Mr Filth can be portrayed as amongst a plot line br br But dear god I was oh so wrong This movie seriously bites big time Being a low budget film haha wait make that ZERO BUDGET this obviously lacks the beautiful Howard Stern orchestra musical scores and the Spielberg special effects Nope it s all one camera bad angles and bad blood scenes br br Take for example when our star and violent fiend Mr Filth violently kills a mugger A grab at the throat and blood spits out but oh my it looks like there s a juice packet filled with fake blood in the man s shirt br br To you Cradle Of Filth fans You ll hear two songs throughout the movie but with the camera angles and shoddy filming they drag the overall pleasure of the song DOWN br br My final comment Steer well away from it It s blood gore breasts and hey even a shoddy story to go with it So if you like appalling violence near no voices yes there s hardly any words in this movie then by all means buy it But if shoddy movies isn t your thing then avoid it Don t waste your money
Check out the film s website more time was put into making that than in the writing of the script for this movie It couldn t be more off in it s boasting Original story Original They must have found the script tucked away between the old testament or face legal repercussion for that bit of horn tooting High end special effects Come on I could do better with an Atari 7600 and a jug of earwax Stylish cinematography Oh yes the America s funniest home video look is still a classic I m sure they had little money available for this title so of course the sf aren t really that good or a bit bad now and then or just plain hilarious but it s the story that makes this film a waste of time and money 4 stories rolled into one and all of them brainless bits of seen befores and done already s
I didn t know if i would laugh or cry seeing this Only addicted fans of danni filth could have a taste for this This is supposed to be a horror movie but there s only filth in this The most cool scene is the car accident with real special effects from the best of hollywood Avoid this movie at all costs See this only for studies of how bad can be a movie
This is another of the many B minus movies tagged as film noir in the hope of generating some interest in something that is devoid of it All aspects of the film script acting direction are mediocre The acting by the three leads is wooden I guess John Dall was expected to go places in the movie business but then someone realised he had little talent and therefore ended up doing TV work Lee J Cobb who is usually terrific cannot rise above the poor script and poor direction Jane Wyatt is supposed to be a femme fatale but comes nowhere near convincing the viewers The movie does have two of the strangest looking cars that I have ever seen the one in which John Dall goes after Lee J Cobb is particularly strange The DVD transfer is typical Alpha
This was a disappointing film for me It came to me via a boxed set entitled Classic Film Noir which was a gift from someone who knows I typically enjoy films done in that style I insist that noir is a style not a genre I do not think it is a noir film at all There seems to be a tendency these days to label and market every black and white B movie made from 1947 to 1955 as noir and the label does not always fit There is a persecuted male protagonist Ed Cullen Lee J Cobb and most of the film s action takes place indoors Those are just about the only noir elements that I could see There is no pervasive paranoia or any real reason why one should sympathize with Ed Cullen Jane Wyatt was overdressed and unconvincing as a femme fatale I do not want to spoil this film for potential viewers However I would be interested in hearing what other connoisseurs of film noir have to say about it
Maybe I m missing something because I ve read more positive things about The Man Who Cheated Himself than I have read bad reviews and I just don t get it I like my noirs to have a little style to them with characters that speak look and act like Humphrey Bogart in The Big Sleep or Gene Tierney in Laura None of the characters in this movie have that style or presence or whatever you want to call it Take the lead actor Lee J Cobb His rumpled rolled out of bed look is about as far from the dashing smooth talking noir archetype as you ll find Or take Jane Wyatt as the femme fatale as another example This is one of the worst cases of miscasting I ve seen in a while She s just not convincing in the role br br As for the plot it s tired and lacks any real surprises or anything new for the genre I could have predicted the outcome of The Man Who Cheated Himself after about five minutes And that final cat and mouse chase scene is plain old dull Ten to fifteen minutes of nothing happening really ruined any pacing the movie may have had going for it
I watched like 8 or 9 Herzog movies and none of them had any impact on me br br I watched several documentaries about him He is obviously an intelligent man with great knowledge about films and passion for making them but does this makes him a good director Definitely NO A complete anti talent He can make a good documentary because of previously mentioned traits but a film with actors never br br He can t direct nor write His screenplays are full of badly thought out situations and many situations dialogues in his movies are so childishly and badly done that they cannot be hidden behind the word art in any sense No way Not to mention the unskillful direction so amateurish like To say that he wants to direct like that and write crap like that is a lie br br Like the scene when Scheitz gets arrested and Storszek hides in the back of the store WHO IS HE KIDDING br br He is a cheater he knows what fake intellectuals and critics want He knows what elements he needs to put in the script to get your their attention and empty praising Never mind the rest of the script and sloppy direction br br Just look at Julio Medem If Herzog can make a movie like Medem can then I might re check his old movies and try to find talent in them
LAGE RAHO MUNNABHAI is really a disappointing movie I have seen the first part of MUNNABHAI and it was really good but this one really make u bore n disappoint u br br This movie really waste yours time and money I went with my friend to this movie on the first day of its release and v both get bore in cinema hall br br Role of CIRCUIT was very small n useless n this movie I think SANJAY DUTT cut down the role of ARSHAD VARSHI br br Character of the movie is also not well define like the previous one this movie show u the result of OVER CONFIDENCE br br The ideas of MAHATMA is also not define and confusing br br A REALLY VERY BIG DISAPPOINTMENT
The reason I intended to give this movie a chance to take 2 hours of my life actually it was only 35 minutes was my wish to try to understand and hopefully appreciate Indian cinema All I have ever seen were few older movies of S Ray br br Browsing through IMDb I came across this one and after seeing rating of 8 7 I concluded this must be the one which will open the doors of unknown and bring artistic enjoyment Oh my how wrong I was The only logical explanation for this rating of 8 7 is that most of 970 people who voted are Indian and their only venture outside Bolliwood production were Adam Sandler movies br br With this rating this movie would be ranked on 9th place on IMDb List of 250 best movies above Citizen Cane Goodfellas of Psycho I am really not in a mood to review and criticize because there is simply nothing that I find worth remembering from this painful experience My only hope is that there is a lot of Hindu who like me find this movie as is plain stupid with abundance of kitsch and cheesy music
I love the munna bhai MBBS but Lagge raho SUX really SUX I have never seen such a boring movie in my whole life And these high ratings really astonished me that wat happened to the taste of Indian cinema viewers br br MAY BE SPOILER br br An educated girl needs an advice from a Bhai people discussing their personal prob on phones come on man from which part of the world u r I agree that films should be fictitious but these things are really indigestible br br 2 out of 10 2 stars is for 15 mins good starting
Let s see where to begin bad acting I m not sure if I d even call it that as it more along the lines of a no effort script read The actors didn t even seem to be into their parts and seemed quite lifeless and listless Sure there was a scene or two with nudity but that couldn t save this movie from it s lifeless characters br br To call the main character a rapper is an insult to the people who actually do The lyrics had no rhythm or flow and seemed more along the lines of senseless rants br br Budget Did this movie even have a budget It seemed like they used less money than I ve seen in a home shot YouTube video Bad lighting props poor sound post production Bad special effects if you want to go so far as to call them that Story could have been good if the people actually seemed interested in making it so but there was no life to this flick I don t care who directed it br br I ve seen some really bad flicks in the past year and this one is definitely at the very bottom Don t waste your time or you ll be wishing you listened to this unbiased review Check the ratings you ll see the 1 s are rapidly outpacing the fluffed 10 s with hardly anything in between Wish I would have looked a little closer before wasting my time What a suck fest
This is a film that makes you say 2 things 1 I can do much better than this acting writing and directing 2 this is so bad I must leave a review and warn others br br Looks as if it was shot with my flip video I have too believe my friend who told me to watch this has a vendetta against me I have noticed that there are some positive posts for this home video Must have been left by crew members or people with something to do with this film One of the worst 3 movies I have ever seen hopefully the writers and director leave the business not even talented enough to do commercials
With a story and screenplay that seems to have been written by a high schooler The Art of Seduction fails to deliver the romantic sophisticated experience it tries to bill itself as The two main characters have the potential to be interesting both male and female lead are swinging singles or in the female lead s case engaged but The Art of Seduction doesn t even try Shirking from a frank examination of these two characters personalities The Art of Seduction eschews anything of substance for a basis of thin lean stereotype br br The Art of Seduction is insulting insulting to its characters insulting to men and women and insulting to its audiences expectations It takes the awful beautiful people we all know and plays out their painful interactions while expecting us to idolize them Ji wan is an immature spoiled manipulative bitch The viewer is expected to like and forgive her flaws because she s pretty Min jun well he s exactly the same Neither are nice people The humour in this film primarily revolve around Ji wan and Min jun s outlandish attempts at outdoing each other in the honourable art of lying and manipulation No character development occurs and we never learn why Ji wan and Min jun are like this We are simply expected to take them as they are and not ask questions they re cute and that s all that matters The copious references to the celebrity of the main actors in azn cinema scenester s reviews may tip you off to Art of Seduction s shallowness br br If you re still in high school you liked Grease or you are a yellow fever victim you may like this movie br br Despite its Romance tag this is not a very good date movie
A friend of mine lent this video to me and I was fairly excited to watch it but after ten minutes of James Hetfield s slow pitched vocals and Lars banging on his drum set in what appeared to be slow motion I began to think Why am I watching this That question will be coursing through your minds in 5 10 minutes after you hit Play I gave the tape back the same day as you would suspect not worth buying or watching br br Just my opinion br br
Bill Buddy Rogers is sent to New York by his uncle Richard Tucker to experience life before he inherits 25million His uncle has paid 3 women Jacqui Kathryn Crawford Maxine Josephine Dunn and Pauline Carole Lombard to chaperone him and ensure that he does not fall foul of gold diggers One such lady Cleo Geneva Mitchell turns up on the scene to the disapprovement of the women We follow the tale as the girls are offered more money to appear in a show instead of their escorting role that they have agreed to carry out for the 3 months that Bill is in New York while Bill meets with Cleo and another woman At the end love is in the air for Bill and one other br br The picture quality and sound quality are poor in this film The story is interspersed with musical numbers but the songs are bad and Kathryn Crawford has a terrible voice Rogers isn t that good either He s pleasant enough but only really comes to life when playing the drums or trombone There is a very irritating character who plays a cab driver Roscoe Karns and the film is just dull
I had read many good things about this adaptation of my favorite novel so invariably my expectations were crushed But they were crushed more than should be expected The movie would have been a decent movie if I had not read the novel beforehand which perhaps ruined it for me br br In any event for some reason they changed the labor camp at Toulon to a ship full of galley slaves The scene at Bishop Myriel s was fine In fact other than the galleys things survived up until the dismissal of Fantine Because we do not want to have bad things happen to a good woman she does not cut her hair sell her teeth or become a prostitute The worst she does is run into the mayor s office and spit on his face Bamatabois is entirely eliminated Because having children out of wedlock should also not be talked about Tholomyes is Fantine s dead husband rather than an irresponsible dandy Valjean is able to fetch Cosette for Fantine before the Champmathieu affair so they reunite happily yet another change Then comes the convent which is a pretty difficult scene to screw up Thankfully it was saved After this three minutes of accuracy however the movie again begins to hurtle towards Classic Novel Butchering br br As Cosette and Valjean are riding through the park they come across Marius giving a speech at a meeting About prison reform When he comes to hand out fliers to Valjean and Cosette he says the one line in the movie that set me screaming at the TV set We aren t revolutionaries I could hear Victor Hugo thrashing in his grave OF COURSE THEY ARE REVOLUTIONARIES They want to revolt against the pseudo monarchy that is in place in favor of another republic you dumb screenwriters It s a historical FACT that there was an insurrection against the government in 1832 br br At one point Cosette goes to give Marius a donation from her father for the reform movement and meets Eponine Except not Eponine Or at least not the Eponine of the book This Eponine appears to be a well to do secretary girl working for the prison reformers who are working out of the Cafe Universal as opposed to the Cafe Musain Not to mention the audience is already made to dislike her thanks to her not period low cut tight fitting dress and her snooty mannerisms br br The prison reformers Lead by the most poorly cast Enjolras that I have EVER seen decide that handing out pamphlets isn t good enough anymore So they re going to build barricades I don t know about you but I have never heard of reform movements tearing up the streets and building barricades and attacking government troops About three hundred people it was not supposed to be so many start attacking the National Guard and building a bunch of barricades etc Eponine does die for Marius thankfully br br The rest of the movie is sort of accurate except that Javert s suicide again seems hard to understand thanks to his minuscule screen time and odd character interpretation The movie ends with Valjean watching Javert jump into the river This is again inaccurate because Valjean would never have let Javert drown He saved the man s life earlier why let him die now Then there s the whole skipping of Valjean s confession to Marius his deterioration and his redemption on his deathbed with Marius and Cosette by his side br br Overall I can blame the script mostly for the problems While I am glad Enjolras and Eponine were at least present in the film they were terribly misinterpreted as was the entire barricade scene The elimination of Fantine s suffering prevents us from feeling too much pity for her That Cosette knows Valjean s past from the start messes with the plot a good deal I did not even see Thenardier and Mme Thenardier only had a few seconds of screen time The same with Gavroche I did like Frederich March s interpretation of Valjean a lot however which was one of the redeeming features of the movie On the other hand Charles Laughton for all his great acting in other movies seems to have missed the mark with Javert The lip tremble the unnecessary shouting and his acting in general all just felt very wrong He also like many Javerts I have seen did not appear at all menacing something required of the character br br Again this film would probably feel much better if I had not read the book I would not recommend it to book purists though I would also say that the movie would have been a good adaptation for the time had not the infamously accurate French version come out the year before
Here s an indie film I really wanted to like but ultimately could not The lack of script boldly proclaimed in the main titles really shows through and kills the picture The story is a nonsensical mess that isn t worth trying to figure out I quickly became bored within 10 minutes then suffered through the remainder of the first 40 minutes hoping for the best before hitting the chapter stops to mercifully get to the end even that wasn t worth the extra effort OZARK SAVAGE clearly tries too hard to be clever lifting its best sequences from EVIL DEAD 2 and THE MATRIX As a result there s very little in OZARK SAVAGE that hasn t been done before and better This film would have been much more fun as a 10 20 minute short but as a feature it just feels padded and forced Of course there s no money in shorts so I completely understand the financial reasons that I assume motivated it being stretched out to 75 minutes Director Matt Steinauer shows great promise and I wish him luck
Many people thought that this is a good movie but I don t agree with them At the beginning of the movie a spaceship crushed on earth and some of the aliens escaped from the spaceship then hey killed some people on the earth but for no reason Also it is in a dark forest I can t see anything on the screen I can only hardly hear the sound br br After a few days the predator came to the earth but no one had sent signals to him before that he should not know what happened on the earth so there is a contradiction Finally the predator found the headmaster of the aliens and killed it for no reason He was not live on earth t is none of his business about the things happened here Lastly the duration of the movie is only 90 minutes long the summary is too short and it can t tell the reviewers about the story clearly br br In conclusion I don t think this is a good movie
I just finished a marathon of this series and it became agonising to watch as it progressed From the fictionalising of the historical elements to O Herlihy s awful accent in later episodes the show just slumps the further it goes If you are looking for some low quality production generalised WW2 fluff then I could recommend season 1 but avoid anything after that it degenerates into being one step from a soap opera with increasingly worse story lines and sensibility br br The old B W film is by far the best of any form of entertainment with the Colditz name attached to it and even that is not what one could hope for
Saw this film recently and have to say it was the worst attempt at film making I have ever had the misfortune to see What the Hell was going on with Coolio Totally unprovoked shooting at people in distress Totally uninvolving slow tedious and detached Worse than Spawn long live Evil dead II
What the hell of a D Movie was that Bad acting bad special effects and the worst dialogues storyline i ever came across The only cool thing here was Coolio who had a nice cameo as a freaked out cop However the rest of the film is awful and boring It s not even so bad you can laugh about it Just plain crap And whoever compares this to the Evil Dead Series might as well compare Tomb Raider to Indiana Jones well ok at least there was Angelina Jolie in Tomb Raider 1 out of 10
This movie is BAD It s basically an overdone copy of Michael Jackson s Thriller video only worse The special effects consist of lots of glow in the dark paint freaky slapstick fastmoving camera shots and lots of growling I think the dog was the best actor in the whole movie
This film is so much of a rip off of the masterpeice demons and thats the only thing that makes the movie worth watching The acting is terrible the action scenes are speeded up the script is almost painful and budget non existent br br If you think this film is good then you havn t seen a real horror film skip this and get a copy of the movie demons
Lame lame lame A 90 minute cringe fest that s 89 minutes too long A setting ripe with atmosphere and possibility an abandoned convent is squandered by a stinker of a script filled with clunky witless dialogue that s straining oh so hard to be hip Mostly it s just embarrassing and the attempts at gonzo horror fall flat a sample of this movie s dialogue after demonstrating her artillery fast dolly shot to a closeup of Barbeau s vigilante character she any questions hyuck hyuck hyuck Bad acting idiotic homophobic jokes and judging from the creature effects it looks like the director s watched The Evil Dead way too many times br br I owe my friends big time for renting this turkey and subjecting them to ninety wasted minutes they ll never get back What a turd
This is arguably the worst film I have ever seen and I have quite an appetite for awful and good movies It could just have managed a kind of adolescent humour if it had been consistently tongue in cheek à la ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW which was really very funny Other movies like PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE manage to be funny while apparently trying to be serious As to the acting it looks like they rounded up brain dead teenagers and asked them to ad lib the whole production Compared to them Tom Cruise looks like Alec Guinness There was one decent interpretation that of the older ghoul busting broad on the motorcycle
My friend s mom used to work at a video store and got to preview movies before they came out so when she brought home The Convent a horror movie i couldn t wait to watch it Given that it s supposed to be scary but is actually downright hilarious I can say that in some weird way I like this movie br br yes the acting is bad and yes it s the cheapest movie i ve ever seen but it s so damn funny WHAT ARE YOU SMOKING CA RACK i didn t know this movie even was ever released i figured it was too bad br br Yeah so overall the movie is pretty bad you gotta admit that much at least but I promise you you will get a good laugh out of it br br this movie kinda sucks but it s good for a laugh especially that guy that holds the dagger of despair THE DAGGER OF DESPAAAAAAIR
This movie is one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen From the very first scene i knew it would be a smash crash It starts with a seemingly bad girl killing a bunch of nuns in a mission As it turns out the people in it were possessed by some random zombies Well some years later some college kids are pulling some pledge prank Horrible acting goes from pledge to the head jock Things like the jock yelling at him to do stuff in quite a non chalonte manner with pledge over reacting and over doing the whole eager to be popular role What really took the cake with this one is the final battle Absolutely HORRIBLE special effects with the guns For example guns making a noise with no muzzle flash and vice versa this is accompanied by stop animation zombies why they move in stop motion is a mystery cheesy music and about 40 guns that come out of nowhere br br Overall this movie is crap Just like so many others you can rent for 50 cents at your nearest low brow movie rental place
This film wasn t programmed in Italian cinemas I have seen it at a manifestation called fantafestival I find it terrible because some scenes seems like music videos chaotic and dark the use of fluorescent colors is ridicule and there s no suspence in the film Music is completely out of the story and I don t have words to describe the visual effects If you look at the first scene the film seems to be interesting but a few minutes later it becomes busy The story is interesting but the development needs a complete review
In fact these young people were so distasteful that I couldn t wait for all of em to get slaughtered and that includes Clarissa Joanna Canton since I considered her the most annoying of the bunch br br But I knew it was gonna be a mess from the opening minutes when a teen Christine opened fired on the priest and the nuns with the Leslie Gore music playing in the background It had nowhere to go but down br br Even the prosthetics looked fake and the blood looked suspiciously like Hawaiian Punch although later on it took on red day glo look to match the silly halloween makeup they were all wearing I m sure all the GOTH morons out there will appreciate this bullsh t since it ll appeal to that bunch It sure didn t appeal to me Blah br br And not even my favorite horror babe Adrienne Barbeau can save this stupid teen horror flick from itself She still looks hot though I m glad she takes care of herself since we don t get to see too much of her nowadays br br However it is a step up from Dante Tomaselli s meandering HORROR 2002 in that it has a somewhat coherent plot so I ll give it that much That and the little Boston terrier named Boozer also brings it up a notch I like what Boozer does to Clarissa in the end It was the only good scene in an otherwise silly film br br Lion s Gate Films sure must have been desperate when they picked this one up br br 2 out of 10
When I tell people that I review movies as a hobby the first thing they say is What do you think of such and such movie There are a couple of problems here Firstly there is the probable chance that I ve not seen it and thus I ruin my reputation Secondly I could trash the movie in question without realising that it s actually their favourite Lastly I could be given DVDs to watch so they can judge my opinion Thus I find myself sat before The Convent which is the sort of film I would ignore completely given the choice but unable to avoid here More s the pity because this frankly dreadful horror is about as scary as a box of kittens br br Following well worn clichés The Convent focuses on a bunch of American high school students on a trip to an abandoned convent on a mission to get stoned laid and mildly spooked But you ll never guess what happens next A group of cannibalistic demonic nuns emerge from the cobwebs who proceed to pick the kids off one by one in classic horror movie tradition Will any of them survive and more importantly haven t you got better things to worry about br br The only thing that saves The Convent from being a total waste of time is the fact that nobody is really taking this tosh seriously with the exception of Coolio s bizarre cameo as a hyperactive cop with an itchy trigger finger It s far too amusing to be properly frightening the zombie cheerleader who makes chipmunk noises for no reason the day glo paint jobs that appears when you become a zombie but what really kills it as a horror is the fact that you can instantly tell when someone is going to jump out and get messily murdered But even if they were trying I still doubt that it would work demonic nuns wearing the sort of make up you d see in the Buffy The Vampire Slayer TV show aren t really that scary The scariest thing about this movie really is that over 10 of voters gave this a maximum score I mean I know it s funny but I hardly split my sides To be honest I ve had more fun in a dentist br br The Convent isn t really a horror movie as such It s more of a comedy horror like Scary Movie or Shaun Of The Dead but you re laughing at it instead of with it I honestly can t recommend this to anybody except the family of the cast and crew but even then I doubt very much they d enjoy it I don t enjoy the so bad that it s good genre I personally feel that if the film makers can t be bothered to salvage a turkey then I shouldn t bust a gut trying to watch it Yes it s a bad film and yes they really should have gone home and done something more constructive A Rubik s cube for example The DVD box has two price stickers one for 4 99 and a reduced price of 3 But it was sold for 1 and that should tell you everything you need to know about this poxy cheap awesomely bad flick Sorry if you do like it but The Convent really is a pile of unholy crap
I just watched The Convent for the second time I had enjoyed it previously and figured it would make for a good drunken Friday night film some gore some style bit of humour and suchlike I was saddened to find that I could no longer appreciate it much It seemed like someone had set out to revisit cheeseball epics like Night of the Demons for a modern audience but lost the things that made the original worthwhile For the record I m not even a huge fan of Night of the Demons but there were some things I really dug about it The Convent does the cheese but the not the goodness so much Apart from the main girl likeable performance from Joanna Canton the goth girl and a sweet cameo from Adrienne Barbeau pretty much all the characters were excruciatingly unlikeable festering at the absolute lowest levels of moronic offensive jockhood The film is then gravely hampered by the complete lack of gratuitous nudity which means that given the awful dialogue it is difficult to watch the characters and harder to appreciate the good points of the film The evil nuns are original in design and get lots of good scenes though not scary their certainly kinda cool and the film also fields a fair amount of neat gore Towards the end when Adrienne Barbeau is on the scene the film becomes quite entertaining cause all the obnoxious people are dead and its an evil nun bashing frenzy The stylised direction also occasionally yields good results although sometimes the camera just moves too fast All in all this was a film where for me the shining good points just can t make up for the things I hated Those more fond of this kind of film may well enjoy it a lot more but for me it wasn t a good time
this film is pretty awful the only thing stopping me from giving it a rating of 1 was the fact that I unfortunately have seen worse br br The jungle music juttering demons and fluorescent UV style blood teeth eyes give it that awful look and the script is dire this film is more like a test to see how long you can last before giving up on it It s also predictable but not in a good way Nothing this film does is in a good way I watched it 10 minutes ago and thought I would rant a bit so there you are oh and the acting doesn t let the film down it s also terrible
This film is absolutely horrific One of the worst movies I ve ever seen The story does nearly not exist the characters are full of stereotypes and the Special FX only make you laugh The only remarkable thing about this movie is the guest appearance of the Rapper Coolio as some kind of police officer br br If this film was supposed to be a comedy I didn t quite get the point If you want to watch this movie please get yourself drunk first and then prepare for some good laughs especially when the first Special FX appear on the screen br br But if you like trash movies made on the cheap this film is a must see for you
Worst movie I have seen since Gingerale Afternoon I suppose that this is a horror comedy I pretty much predicted every scene in this movie The special effects were not so special I believe that I could come up with as good of effects from what I have lying around the house I wish I could have something good to say about this movie but I am afraid that I don t Even Coolio should be ashamed of appearing in such a turkey I do after a little thought have one thing good to say about this movie it ended
I thought that this movie was pretty lame If you re looking for cheesey you may like this I myself don t mind a fair amount of cheese but this was ridiculous The progression of the movie bored me and the storyline was very weak br br The only thing entertaining about this movie was the day glo zombies but even that isn t reason enough to see this flick
I saw the trailer to this film and it looked great so I went out and bought it What a mistake the acting is a shambles the special effects if you could call them that look like something that wouldn t be out of place at a school play Some of the characters are so stupid in this film you will cringe the minute they are on the screen which unfortunately is all to often As for a story forget it This is a warning don t waste any money at all on this film it has to be one of the worst things I have ever seen If for some reason you like this film watch Troll 2 you will probably enjoy that as well
This movie is AWFUL I don t even know where to begin I m speechless I can t even describe how awful this is The blood is flourescent first of all and the acting is AWFUL The only good part was the biker chick that saves the day This movie was rediculous I don t see how it could even get a vote of 1 its so bad It looks like it was made by highschool students
This is one of those movies that should have been way better than it turned out to be I dread to think what the Blockbuster approved edit must have looked like because the director s cut on DVD was a bore of the epic proportions Naturally you don t expect it to be The Godfather but an acting class or two might have come in handy br br Also there were so many cute guys in this movie but they were woefully under exploited I like watching a bevy of hotties writhe around in their BVDs as much as the next guy but even I have a right to expect a little more It wasn t a total loss though at least we got a peek a Drew Fuller s covered junk and truly upsetting haircut And there s Huntley Ritter looking even cuter than he did in Bring It On and acting about as well There s always a silver lining kids You just have to look really hard for it And occasionally you have to make use of your pause button
Voodoo Academy features an Academy like no other one that houses only six male students in one bedroom These teenage guys are instructed in religion by a sinister young priest who enjoys tormenting and comforting them simultaneously The sole administrator of this Academy is a young and seductive headmistress and she retains her handsome charges on a short leash so to speak br br Sexual overtones abound and the director obviously has high regard for young male bodies These young actors occasionally strip down to their designer underwear to sneak about the Academy and their sexuality is the entire focus of the movie If you re not interested in the male form stay away br br Burdened by weak and awkward dialogue this low budget exploitation piece just stumbles along with a few laughable special effects tossed in between the yawns The mood is claustrophobic with tediously long takes a handful of cheap sets and few costume changes These visual elements come interspersed with seemingly unending sequences of banal dialogue intended as character and plot development It gives one the feeling it was filmed in three days
I have seen a lot of bad films Most of the time I can enjoy a crappy horror film for what it is But this really takes badness to new extremes br br It is bland the plot for what it is never really goes anywhere and takes its time over it There are no shocks no horror no suspense just a load of guys rubbing themselves for an hour and a half and then a quick finish br br A blight on the crappy horror genre avoid at all costs br br
i know you ve read that before on countless other films no doubt if you re reading the comments here but voodoo academy still stands as the absolute worst film i ve been able to track down no doubt the really bad ones aren t even available to buy or watch on tv but even so i feel it s fair to qualify that i m not just some dumb renter who picked badly br br i ve seen two thirds of the bottom 100 ranked films here on the imdb and i m ticking of the remaining ones with every chance most of those stand head and shoulders above this excersize in absolute monotony br br i like to rate truly bad films as in ones with no humour even in how bad they are by how many people you need to watch it with to make it all the way through if you can watch it by yourself it isn t that bad if you can watch it with one single friend it s bad but could be a lot worse br br it took 5 of us to make it all the way through voodoo academy and not even the usually fun moments of watching bad films spotting the boom mic for example 3 times in this one if i m not mistaken could take away the dry taste in my mouth yes i d watched it but i d also forced 4 of my friends to watch it with me to achieve that end br br i hope and pray we saw the directors cut to think that there could be a version with 20 more minutes of big eyebrowed lugs with baby oil glands rubbing their torsos just scares the hell out of me so much of the film centers around this br br i do applaud david decoteau for managing to lens this film in two days on a short budget just as i applaud him for convincing people to pay him to make what is no doubt a celluloid version of some of his fetishes but it isn t a good film the original shop of horrors was shot in the same length of time for a comparitive amount of money considering inflation and was an utter gem it s not an excuse for how bad this baby is br br spoilers ahead br br it s not even worth picking apart the plot holes or cliched know it all hero characters the pacing of the film is insane nothing is interesting for the length of time decoteau dedicates to the pectoral self massaging no matter what your alignment or sex rubbing just cannot sustain that kind of screen time br br the acting is cheese but not overly amatuer i ve seen a lot worse in better films but somehow it s the semi competent delivery of some of the worst lines you ll ever hear in a film that really grates br br rent this if like me you have a fascination with the worst of the worst and only if you re going to watch it with a group of people who are prepared to work to get through it this is no ha ha ha the set wobbled affair it s an endurance test you probably want to skip br br i m sure there is worse but i wouldn t be surprised if it has decoteau s name on it
This was probably the worst movie i have ever seen in my life It was stupid there was no plot and the special affects were ridiculous And i have never seen such bad acting in my life The only good part about the movie were all the hot guys especially Drew Fuller I don t know what these people were thinking when they made this movie I didn t even want to finish the whole thing because you get to this point in the movie where the guys are all in bed touching themselves I mean it was like some kind of sick and twisted kiddy porn I would advise anyone who has heard of this movie and was interested in seeing it to just forget about it and find another movie to watch I was very disappointed The whole movie was a complete waste of time in my opinion
If you like to comment on films where the script arrive halfway the movie then this is the one A setting and acting as in a Porn movie but nothing is happening only some groping and touching of the third kind Which actually becomes very boring after 45 minutes of touchy feely but no action A few of the actors I ve seen in real x rated movies and there their acting then was a lot better All the special effects are done by the great Rondo Whom performs all the magic whit his mind A cult movie is written on the box Does that mean that this film is not to be watched at all br br Get drunk with some friends and watch this movie on new years eve ore thanks giving
Cheap and mind blisteringly dull story and acting Not a single good line not even a line bad enough to be good and no memorable delivery Even the blooper reel included with the DVD showed how inept the actors were and how little fun any of them were having The esoteric and occult basis was apathetically inauthentic and the antagonists failed to be creepy or believable The homoerotic overtones were pointlessly tame and dissatisfying and were limited to young boys caressing their chests while flaccid in their boxers I m not gay enough to appreciate it but a little action might have at least kept me and my girlfriend awake
You can t hold too much against this knowing that it was made in four days and I had expected it to be campy anyway It s not all that campy in reality With the exception of Kevin Kalisher and Huntley Ritter who don t take themselves seriously the rest of the cast plays it halfway straight Riley Smith is exceptionally bad The ridiculous story is actually paid attention to which kind of shocked me I assumed the whole purpose with these ultra low budget horror movies was to cater to the basest sexual fantasies and not give a damn about the story but they use lots of words like technological and physicality in the script to get their point across Although it s possible that the story is important only to explain why there s so few cast members Nobody cares about this stupid storyline and the only things that are interesting in the film are the mocking of cults and the soft core homoeroticisms which aren t all that edgy I would have enjoyed it more if there were just some random killings for no reason The film is grainy with a TV quality look and acting level There are a few sexy scenes that are alright the boys writhing in bed in their boxers feeling themselves up or being tied down and making orgasmic faces while wine is poured on them and some of them are kinda funny And I liked the digs at L Ron Hubbard and the intended irony of a story about religious cultists told with intense gay overtones but it still isn t any good 3 10
And a few more no s on top of that Voodoo Academy is without a doubt the least ambitious film of all time What exactly is it trying to do Tell a story Obviously not as has been pointed out most of it s just barely legal guys rubbing themselves Could it then be an attempt at subversive homoeroticism Well maybe if not for the fact it never ever ever goes beyond the most innocuous and nonthreatening forms of male contact Which is to the delight of none repeated about eighty thousand times Well it is sort of a horror movie is it trying to scare us Not unless the director meant to do so through the utter tedium and vacuousness of his work br br Never in my life have I enjoyed a movie less This is the most boring and unnecessary thing I ve ever seen It s like Voodoo Academy takes the genres of horror zombie and gay movies puts them in a grinder then runs them through a coffee filter only instead of it being the kind of coffee filter that filters out coffee beans it s the kind that takes out everything vital edgy or in any way interesting The result is 74 minutes of film every bit as exciting as a glass of warm water only without the ability to rehydrate you after the 10 day gin binge that will inevitably befall you if you watch this abomination of human effort
I have been reading the reviews for this movie and now I wanna kill my self I don t wanna live in a world where people find this move or Rob Schneider funny What is wrong with these people I m not angry at Rob Schneider because he has the intelligence of a dead cat I watched this film in disbelief Who would pay money to make this This film is so bad that its painful Most bad films are funny because they are crap The Animal is just DISGUSTING Watch this film and if you like please for all of man kind kill your self We don t need you I want to raise money to get Rob Scheider off all movies If someone killed Rob Schneider they should be given a Nobel peace prize
Rob Schneider is a famous comedian cause of his movements facials and performances of not humans This time he is The Animal Marvin is a loser who is trying to be a hero and one day nobody takes a call from a man that gets attacked so Marvin has to take this case and save the attacked man But on his way to the crime scene he crashes with his car and gets really damaged He doesn t remember what happens and at the next ordinary day his life is not same when he finds out that he has animal instincts Of course we got our female that our main character is trying to reach but his tryings are useless She is played by Collen Haskell There are no negative characters The negative character is destiny if I could use this metaphor Marvin should find out how to become a normal human being again By the way his animal instincts helps him in some situations Schneider s performance is a so so The movie is so unreal that gets stupid at some moments but it is one of those movies called mindless fun as I have written above So watch it for the monkey style Rob Schneider but it is definitely not one of the best comedies ever or one of the best movies that Schneider appears in He is a great comedian but this is not his best movie
I hired this movie expecting a few laughs hopefully enough to keep me amused but I was sorely mistaken This movie showed very minimal moments of humour and the pathetic jokes had me cringing with shame for ever hiring it Aimed at an age group of 10 15 this movie will certainly leave viewers outside of these boundaries feeling very unsatisfied Worth no more than 3 votes highly unrecommended for anyone not wanting to waste 2 hours of their lives
Guy is a loser Can t get girls needs to build up is picked on by stronger more successful guys etc Seen it saw it moved on I d have to say that Rob needs to move past the Adam Sandler part of his life And get out of the Adam Sandler plots There are two funny parts in the whole movie I couldn t even finish the last 5 minutes I was getting bored The Animal is an alright film I do usually enjoy Adam Sandler films that have the same plot But this was trying too hard to impress The jokes are very old So trust me This is not a film that most people could really get into But some did so I ll be nice br br 3 10
Redundant but again the case If you enjoy the former SNL comedian and his antics in this case Schneider then you should go Basic comedy man s life is saved by having various animal organs transplanted into him Unfortunately he takes on each animal s characteristics Former Survivor Colleen looks pretty good here now that she doesn t have open sores on her legs and a little makeup on her face D
I was expecting a movie similar to Deuce Bigalow which I enjoyed However this dud seemed to last forever It s one of those flicks which enjoys the sad placement of PG 13 while not being kid appropriate The jokes aren t just low brow or f t jokes they re crude lewd and many acts cross the boundaries to not only bad taste but beyond legal and moral decency Many scenes appear to have been chopped to get the PG 13 rating too bad it might have made a bigger splash as an R rated film if the funny was left in Overstatement Probably I do not recommend this movie It is a full on waste of time and I m a movie lover and ready to give just about anything a shot At 45 minutes in the movie felt like it should be winding down and boy were we ready for it to The ending is quaint but doesn t salvage the rest of this quagmire tourist trap of a rental 1 2 star glad I saw it as a freebie would have been sickened to pay hard earned greenbacks for this tripe
NOTHING in this movie is funny I thought the premise giving a human the libido of a randy ram was interesting and should provide for some laughs WRONG There is simply nothing funny about the movie For example the main character making a pass at a goat in heat in the middle of a farmer s yard is not funny it borders on obscenity They are toying around with bestiality in this film on one level and it just aint funny br br We all know that dogs will eat anything anywhere anytime The main character doing this with everything everywhere everytime is also not funny It becomes a cliche br br Rob Schneider is I guess acceptable in the role By this I mean that he s not a bad actor but with rotten material it s difficult to comment on quality However Coleen Haskell the other half of the HUMAN romantic leads does one count the number of animals that the main character has interest in as romantic leads too seems embarrassed by the whole thing as well she should be She seems to be acting in some kind of vacuum detached from all the other actors in the movie br br See this film only if you wish to be bored by tasteless dull repetitive material
This is a very bad movie I laughed once or twice and the storyline sucks There is maybe one funny joke it is stupid and it is boring Through the whole short movie I was falling asleep and wondering when it was going to end br br No one acts human and everyone acts stupid and ridiculous Rob Schneider acting like an animal isn t something I would pay to see It looked funny but the bottom line DON T WASTE YOU RE PRECIOUS TIME ON SUCH A RIDICULOUS AND STUPID MOVIE br br I was wondering when it was going to end even though it is a short movie In the beginning we thought it would get better but it gets worse Stupid all the way to the end I walked out of the theater and I would remember that movie as extremely bad forever br br The writer and co producer of this film is a Simpsons TV writer but this is nothing like The Simpsons this movie sucks
I saw an interview with Rob Schneider who plays the lead character Marvin Mange in this film He said in it that he wanted to emphasize physical comedy here so much that even if you had the volume turned off you d be laughing at this movie Obviously that must be the secret I had the volume turned up I was actually listening to this thing and thought it was a disaster and completely unfunny a major disappointment after Schneider s hilarious performance in Deuce Bigalow Male Gigolo br br The story is stupid Mange is a major loser who dreams of being a cop who gets filled with a bunch of animal transplants after a car accident by a mad scientist type appropriately named Dr Wilder Michael Caton and as a result starts to lose control of his animal instincts This makes him a supercop He can sniff out drugs hidden in body cavities and outrun horses Of course he also has a nasty habit of eating people s cows and trying to seduce their goats but surely that s a small price to pay It just didn t do anything for me br br The cast left much to be desired Is there a more irritating actor in all of Hollywood than John McGinley Here he plays Sgt Sisk Mange s commander on the police force as a repugnantly cartoonish character much the same as his doctor character in the inexplicably popular TV series Scrubs I was anxious to get a look at Colleen Haskell s first serious acting job can anything in this movie be called serious She of course gained her fame as a contestant on the first Survivor and she proves here what we knew from that she s cute as a button What she doesn t prove here is that she has any discernible talent as an actress And what s with Ed Asner as Police Chief Wilson I mean how old is this guy now He s the size of some of the cows Mange tried to eat and he seemed out of breath the whole way through I m surprised he made it through the filming There s a brief cameo at the end by Adam Sandler who also served as Executive Producer of this br br Anyway I chuckled twice Mange playing with his squeaky toys in the police car and the scene Schneider has with Haskell and the orangutan the orangutan has more acting talent So for two chuckles 2 10
I hated this movie so much I remember it vividly It is not even funny Any movie that relies on unfunny sex jokes and racism humor does not deserve the money it costs to make it In the first half hour Rob Schneider drinks a carton of rancid milk All I could think was he deserves it for making such a bad movie Don t waste your time or money on this one
I didn t really like this movie that much at all It wasn t really funny and in some cases it was just downright stupid Rob Schneider is definitely one enormously talented individual and while his acting was fine in this it just seemed like a real waste for him to star in I mean there were some parts that were okay and somewhat humorous in a cute kind of way but that s about it The only thing that actually caught my attention during this whole ordeal of over the top jokes was that there were some very good looking females present and I m not one to watch a movie solely because of that but in this case it was the only nook where even the slightest case of redemption could be found All in all it was a couple notches below an average movie br br Final Query br br Theaters So glad I didn t squander too much money on this br br DVD Purchase Ummm let me think no br br Rental If you have a prehistoric sense of humor then why not
Marvin Rob Schneider does not have the ingredients to be a cop which is his lifelong dream But his luck changes when he has a car crush a very bad one and is found by a doctor The doctor has to use animal organs to rebuild him After this moment he starts to have wild behaviours unconsciously and becomes a best cop one could ever be By the time he realises the changes and his animal instincts starts to take over his human side In the mean time he finds a lovely girl and try to be a perfect gentleman that means he has to control himself and behave civilised I am not a big fun of Rob Schneider In fact this is the his first film I have seen However I can easily say that he is the best person to play the loser See his part in Ally Mcbeal quite funny actually There are some good parts in the movie such as his flirting with the goat In such movies the biggest problem is that the script is seems to make the viewer feel less intelligent I am sure this movie is okay to watch as long as it is not taken too seriously But very sad to see such films doing very good in the box office The Animal is not the worst film I have seen to date but fails to get more than
Ain t it hilarious when an average schmo leading a pathetic life suddenly has something outrageously magical happen to him turning his life upside down and causing him to learn a few valuable lessons along the way That formula never gets old does it It s such a sure fire way to make a classic film Just look at major hits like Liar Liar and Big This must have been Rob Schneider s line of thinking when he made semi successful Deuce Bigalow Male Gigolo and followed it with The Animal Since I ve already traced the plot through sarcasm allow me to color it in more Schneider plays a loser cop who s suddenly involved in a tragic accident but is saved through surgery by a loopy veterinarian who loads him up with animal parts causing him to whinny like a horse at inappropriate times run like a cheetah etc This movie is slightly more likable than other Schneider starring flicks such as another lame same plot follow up The Hot Chick but it almost feels like they want audiences to hate it by casting a reality TV star as the romantic lead Colleen Haskell from Survivor and inserting a cameo by Norm MacDonald My favorite scene just does not exist Sorry nothing memorably good except the production value I just want to end this review by saying that slight references to other movies in a movie can be okay but when it comes to lines being delivered the exact same way You can DO it there s a word for that milking Actually here s another word cheap
I believe that war films should try to convey the terror of war avoid idealism and respect some rudimentary military principles Zvezda barely does the first Zvezda being a Russian war film I was expecting patriotism sentimentality beautiful poetic pictures a lush score Slavic cheekbones and cruel Germans What I didn t need was the naive love non affair the unrealistically silly war scenes and the abuse of the syrupy soundtrack in a film which avoided carefully all historical or political references Stalinism Nazism Holocaust only to end on a passing but nonetheless insulting to our sense of history endnote about liberating Poland A missed opportunity as a film but not as propaganda apparently
For domestic audiences I can see how they would applaud this movie For outsiders with no vested interests it did not make much sense The Germans were portrayed as incompetents and the Russians as heroes The supposedly romantic angle was superfluous and a distraction How a young woman could love the lieutenant from just glimpsing him was nonsense How she could as mentioned at the end of the movie never marry just because of this infatuation was beyond me I mentioned the Germans were portrayed as idiots and that was exemplified in the chase into the marsh Several hundred German troops advanced pushing the Russians into the marsh So the Russians hid and the Germans stopped at the edge of the marsh and just stood there listening I suppose they did not want to get their boots wet but I am sure an officer would have ordered 20 or 30 men into the water to search the marsh But that would have ended the story Also the Germans entered the barn where the Russians were hiding in the loft and did not bother to fire into the roof At the worst some soldier would have tossed a grenade into the loft and not climbed a ladder to peer in br br I did see some reviewers who said they cried at the end I wonder why You knew this small band would perish and they was nothing heart tugging in that
I m a fan of Columbo especially on a rainy Saturday and it was fun to see Oskar Werner after Fahrenheit 451 but this episode was very lacking The original plot and plot twists were obvious and could be guessed way in advance even years before the modern detective shows of today But it was amusing to see the crazy couch patterns and modern electronics equipment and of course the mandatory suburbanite humor poking fun at modern art for sale The high tech home is a Jetson s or Disney version of Tomorrowland and fun to think of writers inventing those way out gizmos br br If its sunny outside go play as there are much better Columbo episodes Still we should be thankful for Cable TV that these episodes are being broadcast
Manmohan Desai made some entertaining though illogical films like AAA PARVARISH and NASEEB but he made some craps like COOLIE and MARD and then GJS br br This movie is one of the worst movies ever made by him the dial became famous Mard ko dard nahin hota but the film is so bad you cringe br br The British are made carricatures and the film looks so weird The scene in the British hotel is damn stupid br br The film has many stupidities like Amrita assaulting Amitabh and then the entire scene plus towards the climax the film becomes even worse There are more gems like the horse statue getting life The masks of Amitabh haha and more br br Direction by Manmohan Desai is bad Music is okay br br Amitabh does his part with style nothing different from COOLIE LAAWARIS type roles Amrita Singh is okay Satyen Kapuu is okay Prem Chopra is as usual Nirupa Roy is again her usual self Dara Singh is also as usual
Bollywood fans pretty much hold Amitabh Bachan s Mard in high regard but I think it is very overrated Manmohan Desai collaborated before on movies like Suhaag Parvarish Amar Akbar Anthony Naseeb Desh Premee and Coolie and I have seen all of them I liked so I had very high expectations before I watched Mard and was bitterly disappointed My main gripe about Mard is that it feels like Amar Akbar Anthony part 2 maybe Mr Desai ran out of ideas after all he had been using that formula for years and years 1 First of all some members of the cast is repeated from AAA for instance the police inspector who brings up Amar the Muslim who brings up Akbar Nirupa Roy and a few more 2 In AAA Nirupa Roy loses her eyesight in Mard she loses her voice 3 In AAA there is the famous song Shirdi wale sai baba well in Mard we have Amitabh singing Maa Sherawali Having seen AAA for over 1000 times I noticed that straight away br br My other gripes are that some of the situations just seem ridiculous true Manmohan Desai made leave your brain at the door kind of movies but with Mard I thought he went too far My last gripe is that compared to songs in previous Manmohan Desai movies I found the songs rather disappointing I know it has many fans that swear by it but I didn t like it one bit It actually pains me to write this review because I am such a huge fan and have loved his movies since I was a child
This must have been one of the worst movies I have ever seen br br I have to disagree with another commenter who said the special effects were okay I found them pretty bad it just wasn t realistic and they were so fake that it just distracted from the actual story br br Maybe that distraction is the reason that I did not fully understand the story The archaeologists are looking for the set They do not bother to tell what set or what is so special about it That also makes it unclear why they search for it in California while the intro of the movie takes place in ancient Egypt br br If you re shooting a movie that takes place in the desert take the effort to actually go to the desert The beginning the ancient ceremony looks like it was shot inside a studio instead of a desert br br The action level was constant throughout the movie no ups and downs no climax It made the movie look short and that s certainly a pro for this particular movie
I make a point out of watching bad movies frequently and the sci fi channel original movies tend to be one of the best sources for these movies you can find As such I m sure you can imagine my disappointment when I saw Sands of oblivion The acting was uncharacteristically sub par as opposed to the woefully disgraceful display sci fi usually has in store for us There are a few cameos made by people you d most likely recognize although you may not know their names by heart The CGI special effects are minimal and as such one of the largest sources of comedy in a sci fi feature is lacking Sure there are some funny moments like when a guy gets beheaded by a bulldozer or when the main character leaves his friend to die in order to save a girl he s known for a couple of days but overall it ends up just not having you rolling on the floor with laughter and I consider that a major disappointment br br If I was rating it on a 10 star scale made specifically to judge made for TV movies I d probably give it a 4 maybe even a 5 A real shame that I may have to wait till the next sci fi original movie to get a good laugh and I really hope that this movie isn t part of some overall quality increase in sci fi original movies
Worse than the rating it has been given This is a typical SciFi movie nowadays bad to awful acting a script that is poorly written and shoddy direction From the opening scene where DeMille is burying his set to the end this movie is terrible In the beginning scenes this movie has Moses which was Charlton Heston in the DeMille film Pharoah Yul Brynner and Nefretiri Anne Baxtor overlooking a boy burying a box in the sand The characters that were to represent the three aforementioned icons were awful and had to resemblance to the people they were to supposedly be The fact that this is in the desert away from civilization is hilarious when someone is hurt and they are all yelling for an ambulance The screenwriter obviously is oblivious to the fact that there are no ambulances in the middle of the desert I was sorely disappointed that Morena Baccarin decided to do a film of such low quality
TV movie about an ancient Egyptian curse brought to the US in the 20 s during the filming of DeMille s first version of the 10 Commandments and which is reawakened when DeMille s sets are unearthed in the desert br br One of the worst films I ve seen in a long time br br The question is were the filmmakers serious or kidding when they made this film If this is serious its a laughably bad movie and a great film to pick on for its badness If its a comedy its less good but funny for all of the wrong reasons You will laugh long and hard AT this film probably more than many other Hollywood comedies
Watching the first 30 minutes of Sands of Oblivion gave me high hopes It seemed I was in for a cheaper version of the Mummy The setup was promising in the 1920 s Cecil B Demille makes his opus of the Ten Commandments It seems in using real Egyptian artifacts for the movie set they unleashed an ancient and terrible evil don t they always Aware of what had been unleashed DeMille orders the entire set buried instead of the usual practice of tearing it down Hopefully the evil will be buried with it for all time Then we switch to present day where a team is attempting to excavate the site the movie s first mistake but hey those period costumes are expensive and this is a Sci Fi channel movie The first sightings we get of the Anubis monster are well done and it s a costume that they put some effort into and not the usual cheesy CG effect Then the body counts starts This is were the movie went south for me The reactions to the fact that people are dying in gruesome and strange ways gets a strangely subdued reaction Once they realize that the ancient evil has again been unleashed and is on a killing spree what do the stock issue leading man and lady do They make the usual stop to the guy who knows the truth but never told anyone After getting that vital information do they share it with the comrades at the dig site No they stop off at a hotel for a refreshing shower and some pleasant small talk Really I m not the most motivated person but if I knew a demon from ancient Egypt was on the loose and killing everyone in sight and would be coming after me I d put a little hustle in my step to solve the problem After this overlong and pointless middle section they get around to destroying the Anubis monster in the usual way by racing around in dune buggies and shooting it with a rocket launcher while it s standing by a pile of phosphorous grenades For a Sci Fi movie it was above the usual crap they put out which isn t saying much at all What disappoints me is this could have been a lot more if someone had wrote a decent script for it
I m at this very moment debating whether I should even finish watching this poppycock of a movie They had a pretty interesting idea with the buried movie set and that was it So far this incomprehensible mess has no real story There is the buried set some wolf headed monster running amok an amulet and a bunch of bad actors attacked by the wolf masked whatever it is What I would have missed had I had the good sense to eject this nonsense is a dune buggy chase some really bad C G I some incredibly stupid dialog more bad C G I and the hero fighting paper cut outs Other than the original idea this film has absolutely zero redeeming qualities My mistake for continuing to watch MERK
While the idea is more original than most Sci Fi movies the execution is as usual lacking While the practical mummy effects are not bad and the Gun Nut character is over the top giggle inducing the only real draw is to see Morena Baccarin and Adam Baldwin reunited on the small screen I suspect that was the idea all along They do the best they can with what they have but the must see moments for me were in the first 40 minutes or so when Morena s character sported some Tomb Raider style shorts Not high brow cinema I know but you can t deny true beauty when you see it And Adam Baldwin once again hams it up as the guy you love to hate If you just want to watch a couple of your favorite Firefly characters have a good time with some sub par material then this might be for you If you want good acting and character development then be advised to look elsewhere
Reviews for this film were lukewarm at best while expectations were sky high a big budget tons of popular faces a rather funny idea and a main actress everyone loves The end result is a disaster Alice Tremblay s supposedly humorous journey in fantasy world fails in every way to entertain it s audience I didn t hear a single laugh throughout the entire presentation going through it s page thin story line and one dimensional characters without a single spark not a sign of the magic it wished it had The 90 minutes of film here are sterile with clumsy direction and some good actors doing their best to come of as professionals in a feature that certainly couldn t seem that great an idea on the set let alone on paper L Odyssée d Alice Tremblay is a collage of comic sketches linked together with a very thin layer of good ideas Avoid or boredom will haunt you
Just saw this movie and what a waste of time The movie was predictable and slow It s basically the Mormon bad news bears that play church sanctioned basketball Rather than watching this movie I should have had a root canal The cameo performances were obviously driven by sponsorship funding This movie had potential due to the outrageous behavior that is exhibited by Mormons when they play church sanctioned basketball however because it s rated PG the true nature of the spectacle could not be transfered to film The acting is horrible with the exception of Clint Howard and Fred Willard Thurl Bailey s appearance in the film was completely unnecessary
This movie was the beatliest mormon movie made yet It made the RM Sons of Provo look like well done films It was supposed to be funny from what I was told The best part was the best actor in the movie Travis Eberhard if he wasn t in the movie it probably wouldn t have been made He ruled br br 10 It wasn t funny 9 It was beat 8 It had Thurl Big T Bailey who s character made no sense 7 It was made in Provo 6 It didn t make fun of Brokeback 5 It had Larry H Miller in it 4 It was the 1st movie Clint Howard wasn t funny in 3 Gary Coleman chose the perfect movie 4 a comeback 2 They should have cast at Surreal Life auditions 1 It was made by Halestorm Entertainment
This movie is a total dog I found myself straining to find anything to laugh at just so I wouldn t feel like I d totally wasted my money and my time The writing in this film is absolutely terrible It s a shame it s not up to the standards of other Hale Storm movies br br They should have saved the money on getting D list actors like Fred Willard and Gary Coleman and spent the money working the script until it was right Even Gary Coleman wasn t properly utilized for his role br br This movie leaves you wondering what the point of most of the plot was including the subplots After viewing this movie I m left with the impression that the producers were hoping to capture some kind of Napolean Dynamite like humor where it s not so much the lines as the character and the delivery Unfortunately this movie fails to deliver the lines the characters the delivery or the humor I should have gone to the dentist instead
I went to see this film with fairly low expectations figuring it would be a nice piece of fluff Sadly it wasn t even that I could barely sit through the film without wanting to walk out I went with my two kids ages 10 and 13 and even they kept asking How much longer After lasting until the end I just kept wondering who would approve this script Even the reliable Fred Willard couldn t save the trite dialogue the state jokes and the banal plot I d suggest that whoever wrote and directed this movie I use the term loosely should take an online screen writing class or drop by their local community college for a film class At the least there are many books on directing screen writing and producing movies that would teach them something about structure plot dialogue and pacing
The really sad thing is that this was supposedly the highest budget Halestorm Entertainment has had to work with All involved should be fined for littering since all the celluloid they wasted is good for nothing more than filling the trash Not only is the writing atrocious and the jokes awful but the camera work and film quality are amateur at best The soundtrack sounds like it was created on some guys laptop PC The worst part of all is that I actually sat through the whole thing I think just because I couldn t believe that I had actually paid to buy a ticket and that the theater I was watching it in had actually agreed to show the film
Trot out every stereotype and misrepresentation you ve heard about semi devout Mormons and you ll see they ve all starred in this ridiculous excuse for a film Finally Kurt Hale s fortunes have changed thank goodness and hopefully it will be a long while before we see any of his features in theaters br br The cinematography was amateurish I think they used a camcorder for some of the basketball scenes The plot was limp and very unfunny You really didn t understand why anyone did anything It was like I had sand in my eyes and a 300 pound lady was sitting on my face it was that painful br br The only reason I didn t give this movie a negative rating was because the scale won t let me
First of all let me say the I am LDS or rather I am a Mormon So when I watched this film I automatically gave it the benefit of the doubt I can usually find something redeeming in every movie I watch And this one was no exception It does have its redeeming moments But they are few and far between br br One of the first things I noticed that bothered me very greatly was that it seemed as though Halestorm was ashamed of our Church In the LDS Church congregations are called wards and the basketball court is in the cultural hall NEVER ONCE are either of these two names mentioned The Church is never referred to by name and the standards is as far as it goes in mentioning what our Church believes br br It makes me wonder if the directors are really LDS or LDS wannabes This film had so much potential It could have really shown our Church in a positive light and helped the public to see not only what we have to offer but also what we believe Instead it was only mildly entertaining and left much to be desired If I were not already LDS I d be left thinking Mormons are stupid idiotic and ashamed of their beliefs br br It is NOT a film I will recommend to my nonLDS friends br br Sorry Halestorm You can do better than this
I ve never been a huge fan of Mormon films Being a Mormon I ve always felt that the humor was too exclusive to the LDS community and made us seem like a bunch of obsessive wackos I was hoping this would be the breath of fresh air the Halestorm movie I could finally discuss with my non Mormon friends br br Boy was I wrong br br I figured since this had B list talent like Clint Howard Gary Coleman Andrew Wilson and Fred Willard one of my favorites this would have to be at least a little funny And besides church basketball is ripe with potential for plenty of hilarious gags and such But I must say throughout the entire movie it seemed as though no one knew what they were doing Every joke fell flat and every opportunity for a genuinely funny gag went ignored The dialogue was bland and the film had some of the worst character development I have ever seen Every single character but Wilson s was less than one dimensional It s hard to believe that after nine re writes the film was still as mind numbingly stale as the train wreck I witnessed I can t put into words the rage I felt sitting through this My friends and I were extras in the final game scene so we went to the premiere in Washington City UT Kurt Hale the director was there and I must say I avoided all contact with him after the show He waited at the door seemingly ready for feedback I couldn t bring myself to tell him that his film not only ripped away a good hour and a half of my life but it left a nasty painful scar that I will never forget br br Here are a few specific problems I had There was a minor love story subplot between the janitor and the chubby piano player but these two characters came out of nowhere and were impossible to care about so my friends and I were left constantly wondering why we were supposed to care about these two lame uninteresting characters There were many subplots that popped up every now and then each promising the audience the chance for laughs but each one came and went in a puff of smoke ending before you could even start caring This was pretty much how the whole movie felt br br This film was a major letdown and I feel bad for everyone who s expecting the first REAL funny Mormon movie True the jokes in this one aren t too exclusive to Mormons Then again it s hard to tell what was a joke and what was a loud ringing sensation in my ears br br Please do NOT see this movie Keep in your mind the fantasy that this movie is hilarious Spare yourself the disappointment I went through
I wanted to like this film I really did It s got some good actors but ultimately it falls flat It tries too hard to be funny in some places the daughters over zealous cooking attempts over reaches in others the scene where they clean up someone s yard so he agrees to join the team and has some scenes that while mildly interesting are really just filler all the work scene s And I didn t find the villians intimidating or worth hating so much as I found them to be childishly annoying br br I ve met people like those in the film while playing church ball And I will say the referee s are spot on Still in the end I really didn t care all that much about the characters or their quest for church ball glory Maybe because they were all so one dimensional which I might not have minded so much if the film were funnier or seemed to flow a little more smoothly overall br br Kurt Hale and Halestorm entertainment has made some good films but this is not one of them
Every once in a long while a movie will come along that will be so awful that I feel compelled to warn people If I labor all my days and I can save but one soul from watching this movie how great will be my joy br br Where to begin my discussion of pain For starters there was a musical montage every five minutes There was no character development Every character was a stereotype We had swearing guy fat guy who eats donuts goofy foreign guy etc The script felt as if it were being written as the movie was being shot The production value was so incredibly low that it felt like I was watching a junior high video presentation Have the directors producers etc ever even seen a movie before Halestorm is getting worse and worse with every new entry The concept for this movie sounded so funny How could you go wrong with Gary Coleman and a handful of somewhat legitimate actors But trust me when I say this things went wrong VERY WRONG
I was not expecting much going in to this but still came away disappointed This was my least favorite Halestorm production I have seen I thought it was supposed to be a comedy but I only snickered at 3 or 4 jokes Is it really a funny gag to see a fat guy eating donuts and falling down over and over What was up with the janitor in Heaven scene Fred Willard has been hilarious with some of his Christopher Guest collaborations but this did not work They must have spent all the budget on getting known actors to appear in this because there was no lighting budget It looked like it was filmed with a video camera and most scenes were very dark Does it really take that much film to show someone actually shoot and make a basket as opposed to cutting away and editing a ball swishing through a basket I try not to be too critical of low budget comedies but if you want to see something funny go to a real Church basketball game instead of this movie
This movie has some of the worst acting that I have ever seen Some scenes are original such as the nails coming through the floor This nail trap catches these bad guys The rest of the movie degrades as you go I can t believe that this movie is not even in the bottom 100 movies of all time I also can t believe that there are sequels The next crap movie that I want to watch is R O T O R Could R O T O R really be much worse than this br br
First let s all agree that Lorenzo Lamas could never be considered a skilled actor barely even decent sometimes just plain lousy However in this piece of called SnakeEater the film industry as a whole sank br br First let s start with the plot A Vietnam vet named Jack Kelly aka Soldier who is supposed to be as tough as a strap of leather and then some which you can believe when he shoves a palate of nails through 2 guys feet and pins them to the floor gets word that his family has been killed and his sister kidnapped Therefore he goes on a solo mission to save his sister Had some potential but still pretty thin to begin with br br Now the acting Being an actor myself I am qualified to say that this was some of the WORST acting in the history of the art Lamas is well himself The jackasses playing the Clampets Deliverance rejects should be strung up and shot for their so called performances which are insulting to actors everywhere especially talented ones who never get their big break br br Finally the action The gunfighting is so so at BEST and the fist fighting is deplorable I ve seen more real looking fights at the Renaissance Festival and those were pretty fake looking br br Readers listen to me AVOID THIS PIECE OF CACA AT ALL COSTS IF IT WERE THE ONLY FILM IN EXISTENCE YOU STILL WOULD WANT TO AVOID IT For the sake of your brain cell count do NOT watch this thing
WOW what can i say I like shity movies and i go out of my way to watch a corny action flick but Snake Eater i would have rather had a nail driven into my pee hole while my grandma gave me a lap dance Lorenzo Lamas pfft more like Lorenzo Lameass this guy has as much acting ability as Bill Clinton has self control It has all the goods to make a really bad movie even worse Crazed Hillbilles YEP needless tit shot with a real weird scar YEP crappy soundtrack YEP I wish i could give the movie 10 stars but 1 is as low as it goes Seriously i think someone was playing a joke on me when i saw this it cant be real the worse thing THERE IS 2MORE SNAKE EATER MOVIES guess its in demand
Lorenzo Lamas stars as Jack Solider Kelly an ex vietnam vet and a renegade cop who goes on a search and destroy mission to save his sister from backwoods rednecks Atrocious movie is so cheaply made and so bad that Ron Palillo is third billed and yet has 3 minutes of screen time and even those aren t any good Overall a terrible movie but the scenes with Lorenzo Lamas and Josie Bell hanging from a tree bagged and gagged are worth a few unintentional laughs Followed by an improved sequel
This is a really bad film with bad acting and a very boring pace Lorenzo Lamas is really cool though All the characters are just annoying except Lamas and there is absolutely no one to root or to care for plus the action is very boring The film gives us 3 villains who were supposed to find menacing and disturbing when in fact there boring laughable and just a bunch of morons that i wanted to shut up plus it looks very cheap and amateurish Lorenzo Lamas has a lot of charisma but he can t save this piece of crap and believe it or not the opening was really cool as was the ending however the middle is incredibly boring and got me to have the urge to press the fast forward button plus The dialog is especially laughable There is a cool bar scene that i really liked but once Lamas heads to the dock it all falls apart plus the scene where The villains torture Jennifer s family and kills them were supposed to find it disturbing when it in fact is laughable This is a really bad film with bad acting and a very boring pace Lorenzo Lamas is really cool though however it is not enough not recommended The Direction is very bad George Erschbamer does a very bad job here with mediocre camera work bland location and keeping the film at a boring pace The Acting is pretty bad except for Lamas Lorenzo Lamas is awesome here and while he isn t required to act he is quite fun to watch and has a really cool character and had a lot of charisma however even he can t save this one and he had no chemistry with the cast either Lamas Rules Josie Bell is terrible here and while she s decent looking she isn t very convincing and had no chemistry with Lamas Cheryl Jeans is hot but does not have much to do but scream and scared she did okay at that Robert Scott is INCREDIBLY annoying as the main villain and wasn t menacing at all he was laughable as were the other 2 Rest of the cast are bad Overall Avoid Avoid even if you do like Lamas like me out of 5
Now I ve seen a lot of bad movies I like bad movies Especially bad action movies I ve seen and enjoyed all of Jean Claude Van Damme s movies including the one where he s his own clone both of the ones where he plays twins and all three where he s a cyborg I actually own the one where he plays a fashion designer and has a fight in a truck full of durians Hey if nothing else he s got a great ass and you almost always get to see it With DVD you can even pause and zoom in That s why you can trust me when I say that this movie is so bad it makes Plan 9 look like Citizen Kane br br Everything about Snake Eater is bad The plot is bad The script is bad The sets are bad The fights are bad The stunts are bad The FX are bad The acting is spectacularly earth time bendingly bad very probably showcasing the worst performance of every so called actor in the cast including Lorenzo Lamas and that s really saying something And I d be willing to bet everyone involved with this movie is lousy in bed to boot ESPECIALLY Lorenzo Lamas br br It does manage to be unintentionally funny so it s not a total loss However I recommend that you watch this movie only if you are either a congenital idiot or very very stoned I was able to sit through it myself because I needed to watch something to distract me from rinsing cat urine out of my laundry br br It didn t help much but it was better than nothing One point for Ron Palillo s cameo as a gay arsonist
Words can t simply describe how awful this film is I watched it on video last night and I simply could not believe what I was seeing Basically Snakeeater is about an ex military man Lorenzo Lamas and his search for his kidnapped sister who has been held captive by Deliverance style Rednecks The film s acting writing direction photography and editing are deplorable along with a song called Soldier that has to be one of the worst theme songs of all time br br However there is one treat Horshack Ron Pallio from Welcome Back Carter is in the film playing a laughable bad guy Otherwise please avoid this mess at ALL COSTS
That Malcom show on FOX is really making a killing can t we do our own version I speculate and paraphrase of course but in our hearts we all know it s true and that the only thing NBC added to the Malcom metric was sex And boy did they add sex br br Thirteen year old Tucker gets a boner and covers it up with his skateboard Tucker accidentally walks in on his Aunt in the shower and she accuses him of watching her and beating off He spies on the cute girl in the next house from his bedroom window and she knows he wants to see her topless but she teases him by smiling and closing the window And this is all in the pilot br br Take it from a grown man a boy s puberty is so sex crazy and testicle driven it is impossible to make it funny for a mainstream audience The only times anyone has ever come close has been in movies and you can count those on one hand So it s no surprise that Tucker has the warmth and appeal of a strip club bathroom Did the network actually think we would like watching kids grapple with puberty Isn t this the stuff people go to jail for If you doubt the show s depravity consider this 13 episodes were filmed but NBC canceled it after only 4 episodes aired they then made the unprecedented move of burning off the remaining episodes by airing them AT MIDNIGHT so no children could see them Ironic since kids were originally the target audience br br Apart from its general scuzziness Tucker features a running voice over from the lead character to flesh out the shoddy writing Even in 2000 it was horribly dated with it s ska incidental music and super sarcasm I couldn t like any of the characters enough to laugh at the jokes and the jokes didn t exactly come a mile a minute Shame on NBC for this dirty rip off they re better than that br br GRADE C
First of all I became dissy after watching this movie for five minutes cause of the bas screenplay I don t think this movie has any purpose It s boring from the first minute to the last I don t understand why this movie scores so high I gave it 1 10 but actually it s not more wurth then 0 10
What were they thinking at Cannes One of the most irritating films of all time Every detail of this film no matter how meaningless was shown If I had to watch her put on those boots one more time I think I would have shouted If the point of this film was to show how pathetic a life Rosetta had then it was covered within the first fifteen minutes of the movie and then the credits should have been running But no we had to see countless redundant scenes over and over The whole thing was filled with un likeable and unsympathetic characters They deserved the misery that was Rosetta And to think I passed up Tumbleweeds to see this over hyped film of boredom It was like watching grass grow only that is more exciting
I go to the cinema to be entertained There is absolutely nothing entertaining about this film From beginning to end there is no respite from the gray grinding reality of this woman s life It is one paced with no change of mood I remained until the end only because I was convinced that things must get better They don t and I don t think I was the only one as evidenced by the many groans ringing around the cinema as the film drew mercifully to a close Honestly depicting social depravation is no crime but boring your audience to groans is not the way to win the sympathy of the public A dreadful film
If I had known this movie was filmed in the exasperating and quease inducing Dogme 95 style I would never have rented it Nevertheless I took a dramamine for the seasickness and gave it a shot I lasted a very very very long forty minutes before giving up It s just boring pretentious twaddle br br The last French movie I saw was Romance and it too was pretty dismal but at least the camera was steady and not breathing down the necks of the characters all the time I am baffled at the continuing popularity of Dogme 95 overseas it ll catch on in America about the same time as the next big outbreak of leprosy It s called Dogme 95 because that s the average number of times the actors are poked in the eye by the camera br br
I have no idea what idiots gave this movie a Palm D Or at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival because it was atrocious I actually watched the entire thing simply because I couldn t believe that someone would make such a worthless film There is nothing interesting about the plot the characters are devoid of depth and there is no attempt at giving any sort of ambiance with music or sound effects Also if you do decide to waste 2 hours of your life by watching this film be sure to bring something to throw up in because the cinematography is simply someone running around with a hand held camcorder and half the time you can t even see the main subjects This style has been used much more successfully in movies such as Blair Witch because it creates suspense In Rosetta there is no plot and no suspense to which that style would lend anything I should have known better when it came on at 2 o clock in the morning that it was going to be horrible
I hate how this movie has absolutely no creative input I know they re going for realism but to be frank I just don t want realism Realism is boring If I want to see daily life I ll uhm live Tell me an interesting story and we ll talk I can deal with the low production values hell I m a sucker for low production values but at least work in some good ideas The direction only goes as far as grabbing a camcorder and walking around a bit but obviously I m supposed to dig that because it makes stuff so much more realistic Hitchcock used to say drama was essentially life with the dull bits cut out I can only conclude this is not drama not by a long shot We get to see Rosetta walking to someplace Rosetta working in a bakery Rosetta eating a waffle Rosetta carrying around bags of far Rosetta walking back home Rosetta walking someplace it s just not that entertaining There isn t really a deeper meaning either I got so bored I started looking for some reflections on life in this movie but it s just plain realism the most overrated quality in the business I guess I m supposed to love this but come on there s nothing in there
This rubbish excuse for television is the single most god awful piece of trash ever to hit Australian television The house mates are dull uninteresting ridiculously unintelligent and are picked on the basis that you would be likely to attempt to murder them if you had to live with them As far as I am concerned Big Brother is the decline of western society showing how us as a society are on a steep slope to becoming brain dead morons Whatever happened to television that didn t target the lowest common denominator of society as an audience This cannot be classified as entertainment I think that it true that Channel Ten can remove your soul It happened to Rove McManus who was once a respectable comedian and once moving to Channel 10 become horribly unfunny With the exception of The Simpsons which is highly intelligently made
If there was a 0 stars rating i would gladly hand it out to this absolutely horrid pile of waste The fact that the actual summary is perfectly fine and that if it had been made different it could have been brilliant only makes it worse The basic task of locking up a group of people in an experiment chamber is fine but WHERES THE EXPERIMENT All i see is a bunch of unintelligent surfers and blondes chatting about music and culture i don t know or want to know about The challenges are pathetic and silly The whole point of reality TV is to show REALITY If you set a challenge don t make them play with exaggerated props of food and stereotypical cultural elements in friday night games make them do an actual challenge And as for earning prize money thats fine if they actually earnt it These people are nuts If only they would make the show better the actual idea would be glorious But that ain t gonna happen
This is the story of two guys who found a copy of Funky Monkey Finding this seemed odd at the time figuring that there are still posters for the movie at the local Cineplex Odeon After seeing such classics as Every Which Way But Loose and Project X these two guys figured movies with monkeys are awesome br br These guys were in for a long ride as they watched this movie There was some monkey that was replaced by a Stunt MAN when action sequences were required It was apparent that the monkey wasn t trained in the school of Shakespearean acting Perhaps replacing the monkey with Ben Affleck might have helped the guys thought br br Maybe a strong sidekick would help like a Jackie Chan or heck maybe even Hulk Hogan Luckily this movie had amazing martial artist and Jet Li look a like Matthew Modine While some might argue that Matthew Modine doesn t come close to Jet Li camera tricks prove that he is every bit as good When it becomes obvious that an untrained chimp can t handle the movie the movie leans on Matthew Modine to be the real star br br Did I mention that there is some dorky kid that develops a bond with Modine and the monkey Is there a possibility that the kid learns confidence and even picks up a girl in this movie Even Matthew Modine should get jealous with this one because using the pick up line I m second fiddle to a monkey doesn t seem to work with the ladies br br Shortly after watching this movie the two guys got a phone call from Matthew Modine telling them Seven days
I bought this movie from Gamestop s discount used movie bin and the cover caused me to laugh uncontrollably so I bought it for 99cents The movie itself is retarded and they use like ten different monkeys throughout the whole film that hardly look alike Not to mention they use a stunt double who is just a short guy in costume making a desperate attempt to impersonate a monkey br br The director more than likely committed a murder suicide with the chimpanzees after the movie debuted in a preview for some other low rent Warner Bros film and he ended up owing money to the studio It also doesn t help that he wasn t even infamous for the terrible job he did he wasn t even known for producing a poop chute film br br Why was this movie ever made
I am a student of film and have been for several years And the concept of a cyber kung fu satirical chimpanzee had me wondering Is this the film that s going to break the mold Let s face it America has never been let down by any piece of cinema that features a simian costar After such great classics as Monkey Trouble and Dunston Checks In I thought that the best ideas were already taken But then comes Funky Monkey I laughed I cried I contemplated suicide br br Now I ve read about demon possession in the Bible but that still doesn t explain why someone would create such a product of evil First off having at least a shred of intelligence I realized that a chimpanzee was in fact an ape not a monkey at all However I was sure that the filmmakers would clear this problem up further into the film They didn t Let me sum up this work of art A company by the name of Z I T has decided to train chimpanzees as soldiers Why I think they mention something about the soldiers working for bananas but when it would cost about an estimated 13 million dollars of government money to train one chimp this doesn t seem cost effective Well anyways Z I T brings in a CIA specialist Matthew Modine to train Clemens The Chimp Clemens is everything Z I T hoped for He can take out an entire shift of guards who all appear to have gotten their training skills at the local mall and yet still manage to remind us that we re watching a kid s movie As you may have guessed Modine finds out that Z I T s intentions may be evil Gasp and decides to break Clemens out Being a CIA agent and all Modine knows that best way to make himself disappear is to go to a large city rent a guest room regularly make appearances on television while fighting crime and using checks to pay for everything br br Z I T finds out where Modine is staying and sends two of their finest to retrieve him These guards are possibly the greatest comedy team up since Martin and Lewis or was it Turner and Hooch It doesn t matter anyways because in the end for a heck of a twist ending the good guys win Yay Hooray for predictability Throw in a nerdy kid who learns to be himself a lonely mom who needs a date and music montages that feature songs that would even be blackballed by Radio Disney and you get Funky Monkey The climax to the movie A football game Played by thugs bumblers a chimp and the nerd boy No one seems to care about such substitutions at a high school football game br br Funky Monkey never lets up It s edge of your seat entertainment Some might even call this the American Beauty of monkey filled features After finishing this epic I recalled hearing a story about a railroad worker who lost much of his brain functions when a metal rod pierced his temporal lobe Funky Monkey is a metal rod among movies
Having watched this after receiving the DVD for Christmas 2005 I came here to pan it but after reading the other comments I haven t the heart Clearly this is a film that has worked very well for children of a certain age Well let me not be a complete Grinch it might still work for some children if they are not too media saturated and have not become visually over sophisticated e g from watching all of LOTR and Harry Potter But if you are an adult stay miles away you will not enjoy it br br The good bits Barbara Kellerman as the Witch especially in her early scenes with Edmund creates just the right blend of charismatic evil and restrained madness At the Stone Table she goes a bit over the top Michael Aldridge in the minor role of the Professor and Jeffrey S Perry as Mr Tumnus also have the kind of polished skillful acting we d expect from the very best BBC dramas And the Aslan costume works very well amazingly well considering They got the eyes just right br br The bad bits almost everything else but two areas in particular One the casting England is crammed with good actors and contains tens of thousands of attractive British school kids How could they possibly have ended up with these four stiffs They move like wooden soldiers and speak about as well Peter has no gravitas or charisma and is visibly shorter than his supposedly younger siblings Edmund is just whiny and Lucy Sophie Wilcox as Lucy is so dramatically visibly drastically wrong for this part that I can t imagine how she got the job br br Two the animal costumes Again it appears that they worked for some kids If the kids are still at a level where Big Bird and Elmo are exciting believable characters they might be entranced by this film But to a viewer with the sophistication of say a 12 year old who s seen Prisoner Of Azkaban When Mister Beaver comes out from behind that tree there will be hoots of cruel derisive laughter The costumes just do not work I could not and I think any adult or modern teen could not suspend disbelief when looking at Mister Beaver The drawn animation later gryphons etc works better is easier to take br br So ten stars for the very young and tender of soul everyone else read or re read the book and watch the far better film that unrolls in your imagination
I m a fan of the series and have read all 7 books I wanted to see this just to see how it was done All i can say is that the only people who should watch this are ones who have already read the series and are curious about it Its pretty bad and will turn you off reading them Not to be mean but Lucy is so ugly it detracts from the movie Was she the directors daughter Seriously I m sure the beavers in the movie were jealous of her teeth She had an overbite that would put any beaver to shame The movie just loses so much in translation CS books don t translate as easily as the Tolkein LOTR books or even Harry Potter br br One thing they did right Aslan very well done Although the other human actors with painted faces beavers wolf look silly Aslan was really well done since it was not just a human actor walking around i guess its like that old horse custume 2 people inside Also i would be curious what kids think of this movie Maybe they would enjoy it But as for adults safe bet they wont even if a CS fan
Ouch They don t come much worse than this horrid adaptation of C S Lewis s beloved novel While the adaptation is very true to the novel the acting is simply awful and the sets and special effects are on a scale equivalent to a school play I ve read that the budget for this miniseries was the grandest that the BBC has ever given at the time but surely they could have scraped together a bit more than the 2 that it looks like this was filmed for The worst effect of all is Mr Beaver I know computer effects weren t at the level necessary or even cost effective at the time but the costume store man in a suit look was horrid Better to have just cut the character from the film than do that to the role Avoid this at all costs
Though the movie may have been true to Lewis s book in that the script was basically word for word verbatim it failed to capture any of the grandeur that would otherwise be associated with an epic story like this The mythical creatures unicorns centaurs griffins ghouls ghosts are drawn in and as in the previous review the green screen flying sequence was very hard to swallow I nearly laughed to death when I saw the humanoid beavers with their giant stiff suits and buck teeth I nearly cried when I heard the wolf s howl a man in a grey fuzzy suit basically shrieking as loudly and as girlishly as he possibly could br br All of the acting is tremendously forced especially that of little Lucy Penvensie I could only take so much indignation desperation and buck teeth in the what felt like fourteen hours of watching the movie The actress who plays the White Witch in all her histrionics seems that she d be more at home on stage where a booming voice spread arms and a valiant effort at something Shakespearian would be more than welcome br br The sets feel claustrophobic whether the scenes are taking place indoors or outdoors Indoors it s as if BBC could only afford to spend 100 on constructing a set and so it is very small and all the characters are constantly huddled together The White Witch s castle is a run down rotting countryside English castle filled with Styrofoam statues and bad lighting When the Penvensie children are wandering through the woods actually any scene in the woods feels like they are simply wandering around in circles br br The only thing that looks decent in the film is Aslan but you can bet that BBC probably blew the film s entire budget on building the mechanical feline It looks great when it s standing still and before it starts speaking but once it starts moving you can t help but pity the poor man who has to be the rear end in the lion suit br br Yes if you are a hardcore Narnia fan you may want to see this version simply because it preserves every word that Lewis ever wrote but Lewis was certainly no screenwriter and a lot of the dialogue feels chunky and awkward when on screen During the scene in which the children are at the Beavers and getting ready to flee from the wolves Mrs Beaver s incessant oh just ONE more thing dearies and then we will be ready to go punctuated by the children s simultaneous cries and sighs and moans of NO Mrs Beaver PLEASE a scene of comic relief so incongruous they are supposed to be FLEEING from imminent danger not wondering about whether to pack the sewing machine or not detracts from the drama that the scene might otherwise have In fact the whole movie is peppered with directing faux pas such as these br br I would recommend seeing the new Narnia Disney 2005 The new movie with updated effects spectacular computer animation great timing all around and a gorgeous and scene stealing White Witch who plays her part with all the subtle evil of a seasoned politician as opposed to a shrieking banshee captures all of the grandeur and the magnificence of the world of Narnia without detracting the least bit from Lewis s original vision I think Lucy is a lot cuter NO buck teeth YAY as are the beavers and realistically sized and bratty BBC Edmund has nothing on the divine Desperately Hungry for Acceptance Insecure and Angsting with an Inferiority Complex Edmund that the new Disney version fronts br br Unless you re the type who enjoys wasting time by making fun of campy movies I would not recommend this film to anyone
This movie is terrible but it has some good effects
I went to see it in hopes of some good old fashioned Alice Entertainment Once I realized I would not be getting that I watched it for a pretty well made movie in terms of filming and yeah that was it But aside from it having a good film quality considering I had been watching grainy movies all day long there was nothing good about that movie br br He killed 42 Why were Tweedle Dee and Dum played by Mudler and Scully Serisouly Who can answer that for me Who can answer anything awful about this movie for me br br I agree with whoever said it was just one big long inside joke for the staff That s all it seemed to be br br Poor Mr Carroll I m so sorry somebody did that to his wonderful tales
I was unlucky enough to have seen this at the Sidewalk Film Festival Sidewalk as a whole was a disappointment and this movie was the final nail in the coffin Being a devout fan of Lewis Carroll s Alice books I was very excited about this movie s premier which only made it that much more uncomfortable to watch Normally I m enthusiastic about modern re tellings if they are treated well Usually it s interesting to see the parallels between the past and present within a familiar story Unfortunately this movie was less of a modern retelling and more of a pop culture perversion The adaptation of the original s characters seemed juvenile and usually proved to be horribly annoying It probably didn t help that the actors weren t very good either Most performances were ridiculously over the top which I assume was either due to bad direction or an effort to make up for a bad script I did not laugh once through out the duration of the film All of the jokes were outdated references to not so current events that are sure to lose their poignancy as time goes by Really the only highlight of the film was the opening sequence in which the white rabbit is on his way to meet Alice but even then the score was a poor imitation of Danny Elfman s work Also I d have to say that the conversion of the croquet game into a rave dance off was awful It was with out a doubt the low point of the film br br What a joke Don t see this movie After its conclusion I was genuinely angry
I m actually watching this film as I write this If the following comments prove my lack of development as a true artistic film maker then so be it br br But I thought am still thinking as I m presently viewing that this film to put it mildly is very very overrated Again very br br It looks like a really really bad student film done by a someone with beyond extremely limited resources and who didn t pay that much attention to detail br br I don t want to go on and on regarding all the different ways that I find this film lacking but well I just don t get it rememeber I fully admit that maybe it s ME that s the idiot here not the film maker for not getting this piece of imaginative genius I rented this on a whim because the reviews were very very outstanding br br Sheesh
A friend once told me that an art house independent film ran in a cinema when upon the closing of the film audiences were so enraged they preceded to tear up the cinema seats Of course my imagination ran amok trying to conjure up the contents of such a piece of work Well now my imagination can be put to rest br br I am a lifelong Andrei Tarkovky fan and an ardent admirer of his work I have come across many people who thought Tarkovsky s films are slow moving and inert Opinions being what they are I found this not to be true of the late director s wonderful works which are wrought with meaning beautiful compositions and complex philosophical questions Upon hearing Aleksandr Sokurov called the heir to Tarkovsky I was excited to experience his films br br With the exception of the open air ride through the fields Stalker this movie has no kinship to anything Tarkovsky has done It does not seem to possess the slightest meaning even on a completely mindless level It s supposedly gorgeously stark cinematography is devoid of any compositional craft There is a no balance no proportion and the exposure meter seems to be running low on batteries in the freezing snow The main character is so inept and indecisive it makes you wonder whether his father might have been alive if he made up his mind sooner br br I am also not adverse to non plots or story lines that progress on multiple non linear fashion But there isn t even a non story here One must surely enter the viewing of this film with a shaved head if one were to exit it with nothing gained and nothing lost as hair pulling would be the only possible answer to a pace that could make a Tarkosky time sculpture look as if Jerry Bruckheimer had filmed a Charlie Chaplin short br br I won t rule out that this may be one of Sokurov s stinkers Tarkovsky s Solaris but to conclude that he is one of Tarkovsky s heir based on this film would be to call Paris Hilton the successor to Aristotle C mon guys don t be afraid to say it No amount of big impressive words is going to magically bring this corpse of celluloid back to life I don t profess to fully understand Russian culture and I probably don t have Russian values but I immediately picked up on Tarkovsky s work as something magical a treasure and a gift to viewers br br If it didn t have Sokurov s name on it and it aired on say Saturday Night Live I m pretty sure nobody would read all these magnificent analysis into this wet noodle of a flick
Believe me I like horror movies I like science fiction movies I like independent films And I like low budget B movies br br Sometimes I even like bad acting plodding scripts wooden lines improbably situations and the like However I did not like Christmas on Mars br br It just doesn t work on so many levels For all the reasons listed previously and many more That includes the nonsensical blatant use of images of female genitalia And the many allusions to male genitalia in a very Freudian way br br I am convinced this is purely from ineptitude As opposed to some attempt at doing something really different I mean any movie that takes years to film just cannot keep up the level of congruity and focus demanded by modern audiences br br I had hoped that the whole movie was just a dream or hallucination by the main character However sadly it was meant to have happened as we saw things unfold on screen br br About the only kindness that I can express is that the image at the end was stupendous If this had been used at the beginning instead of the end it could have allowed the film to take off where 2001 ended br br To bad they didn t try that instead I just don t understand what was so important about this film that it even had to be made Was it the plot Surely it couldn t be Was it the characters I doubt it I mean I could live without knowing about Ed 15 Was it the dialog Emphatically no The music Perhaps but more likely the unvarnished ego of the principals needing to be stroked br br Much better efforts have died on the cutting room floor
THIS CONTAINS MANY MANY SPOILERS NOT THAT IT MATTERS SINCE EVERYTHING IS SO PATENTLY OBVIOUS br br Oh my God where do I start Well here this is the first time I have ever come home from a movie and said I have to get on IMDb and write a review of this NOW It is my civic duty Such is the badness of this flick br br begin digression But let me just state one thing before I start I m not some Harvard art major film noir weenie in fact I went to the college at the other end of Mass Ave in Cambridge the one where the actual smart people without rich daddies and trust funds go which should put me squarely in the nerd who would obsessively love comic book films census group and still I hated this film My viewing preference is for the highbrow cinematic oeuvre that includes the Die Hards Bond flicks Clerks and The Grail I wish the Titanic had never sunk not so much for the lives lost but so we wouldn t have been subjected to that dung heap of a film And the single and only reason I will watch a snooty French art film is if there is a young and frequently disrobed Emmanuelle Beart in it I even gave Maximum Overdrive one of its precious few 10s here on IMDb for God s sake So I m as shallow as they come therefore I m not criticizing this film because I m looking for some standard of cinematic excellence it s because Elektra stinks like a three week old dead goat end digression br br OK there s so much badness here that I have to try to categorize it Here goes br br MS GARNER One of the compelling reasons a male would want to see this flick is to see lots of hot JGar I have no idea why my wife wanted to I think that between this and Finding Nemo the latter was the sexier film You know the red outfit she s advertised wearing in every freaking ad you see You see her in it TWICE once at the beginning once at the end Bummer In the rest she basically looks like what Morrissey would look like if he were a female lots of pouting and black clothes Which brings me to the incredible range of expression JGar shows in her acting ranging from pouting all the way to pouting and crying Oh my God you d think she was being forced to date Ben Affleck or something horrible like that Um wait br br THE BAD GUYS GAL They show about the same range of expression and acting ability that you d expect from a slightly overripe grapefruit At least next to JGar s performance it doesn t stand out too badly One guy s role is to stand there and be huge another s is to stand there and have stuff come out of him and the woman s role is to stand there and breathe on and or kiss people They manage to pull these incredible feats off The main bad guy has the most difficult role of all he has to SIMULTANEOUSLY a appear angry and b appear Asian He does a fine job at this I think there was a fifth bad guy gal but my brain is starting to block parts of this movie out in self defense br br PLOT TWISTS This movie has about as many surprises as a speech at the Democratic National Convention Let s just put it this way my wife who has only been in the U S for half a year and speaks only a small amount of English whispered this to me when the girl first appears in JG s pad and I swear to God I am not making this up She go to house to kill girl And father too And this is BEFORE THE FATHER HAS EVEN APPEARED ON THE SCREEN Now my wife isn t stupid but she isn t being courted by Mensa for her gifts either and she s had zero exposure to Daredevil or the comic book genre And she figured this out in 00015 seconds with no prodding and no prior information Such is the blatant obviousness of this film br br RARELY BEFORE SEEN STUPIDITY OK so there s this big dude in the film He can take a chestful of shotgun blast and brush off the shot like it s lint and he can take a vicious Electra stab to the chest and just bend the metal or melt it or something more defenses kicking in thank God But JG jumps on his head and he explodes An Achilles noggin OK Such is the mind numbing stupidity of this film br br Ack I m starting to feel a cerebral hemorrhage coming on so I have to stop But you have been warned If you have to intentionally slash your own tires to prevent yourself from going to see this movie DO IT And if Armageddon is going to come please let it be before this comes out on DVD
Perhaps I m out of date or just don t know what Electra is like in current publications But the Electra that I read was far more manipulative and always seems to have a plan She usually used others to do her dirty work and more often than not some sort of double cross was involved Just when you think you have it all figured out she pull the wool over your eyes and gets her way br br This movie was fairly weak on the dialog the acting wasn t particularly convincing and the action was spotty I was really looking for something more along the lines of Frank Miller s book Electra Assassin Which is much darker than anything in this movie br br Special effect where cool action was interesting at times but more often than not the story and plot was slow or illogical Tha Hand was not menacing enough and Electra was not bitchy enough She s the girl you love to hate but in this story I just didn t care either way
This is absurd aside from the fellow Australian who has reviewed this flick I can t help but think that everyone else who has submitted a review so far was some way involved in the production of Elektra considering how generous they were with their praise br br Admittedly I m not really a fan of comic book to movie conversions so I didn t go in with many expectations yet still I found Elektra to be incredibly underwhelming The thing that irked me the most was the fact that there was SO MUCH in this film which went by unexplained that left you thinking huh what relevance does that have to the plot or so how did that aspect of the character come about I can only hope that these are things which are perhaps explained somewhat in Daredevil which I have no intention of seeing br br Furthermore the behaviour of the characters in this film appear to do an about face at random moments to suit the storyline and don t even get me started about the utterly pointless romantic sub plot I m also still scratching my head over the fate of Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa s character which seems to have gone by unexplained br br If I can give kudos to this movie for anything it would have to be the fantastic locations in which it was shot but otherwise I gained little enjoyment from Elektra I know we re supposed to suspend our disbelief for fantasy action films but almost everything in this film was so improbable or confusing even by action film standards that it simply frustrated me br br Well hell at least Jennifer Garner looks damn good
How Irish critics rave about this movie is beyond me Overacted by the usual band of Irish actors dragged out for every Irish movie Terrible script with forced character quirks the brown sauce Romanticising all that is bad about Dublin The attitude of ah it s a dump but sure isnt it great all the same Plenty of tidbits purely for American audiences the supermarket boss and his horribly forced catchphrase And the nail in the coffin was Colm Meaney s character A great actor forced to play this part that could ve been written by a five year old Cringeworthy stuff The best thing about this movie is Farrell and it s a bad when you have to say that Well at least he wasnt putting on his dreadful American accent International Audiences be warned stay at home and watch Snatch and Lock Stock You ll have a better time Intermission is a walk outer
This was no Trainspotting or Guy Ritchie film It was a big wannabee It wanted to be an edgy nervous laughter urban life affirming film but it s more of a camera jerky mess It s a lot easier to imitate something else than to create a real story with real characters From the beginning I couldn t care less about the characters or what they were involved in They were always always hitting pissing or crying on each other Only there wasn t any substance to what they were doing The dialog between characters is meant to be hip revealing instead it comes out trite and one scene after another is predictable I know there are viewers out there that really liked this movie so I could be wrong
If you loved Pulp Fiction and like hand held cameras you should love this film I liked the quirky story even though I feel that Pulp Fiction was the most over rated movie since The English Patient and found the characters unrealistic but interesting It s not On the Waterfront or Citizen Kane and is burdened by European pretentiousness But the worst part by far is the hand held camera It is so distracting and annoying I found myself waiting desperately for the movie to end I don t know why new directors think this method of filming is so great If you are prone to motion sickness stay away the hand held camera will have you nauseous in about 10 minutes
I m Irish and I ve been living in Denmark for a while so I was looking forward to going home last week so I could see Intermission And I will go on record as saying br br THIS FILM IS AWFUL br br It is not quite as bad a something like The Most Fertile Man in Ireland but it definitely does not stand up there with other Irish films such as The Commitments I Went Down or Michael Collins br br Some aspects of the film are actually quite funny such as Colm Meaneys American style garda But the film itself is shot completely wrong The bouncing around of the camera and the constant zoom in zoom out tries to give the film an edgy look as if it were a gritty drama But it isn t This is an Irish Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and it should be shot like this It should have smooth movement from one shot to the next The film just looks sloppy and thrown together br br The performances are okay given the awful script A friend of mine said to me like it was like they just followed Colin Farrell around Dublin for a week He gives a decent display as a Dublin Dirtbag but it no way compares to his performances in Minority Report Tigerland or Phone Booth The best performance was from Dierdre O Kane who plays a sexually frustrated middle aged woman who has just been dumped by her bank manager husband for a younger woman I think she should leave her god awful stand up and focus more on her acting br br All in all its does in no way live up to the expectations put on it by the Irish press or deserve to be even considered as one of the best Irish films ever br br I m expecting a backlash from these comments because most people I have spoken to have said it was great But before you reply ask yourself Would think so highly of this movie if it was set in England or America
This movie blows let s get that straight right now There are a few scene gems nestled inside this pile of crap but none can redeem the limp plot Colin Farrel looks like Brad Pitt in 12 Monkeys and acts in a similar manner I normally hate Colin because he is a fairy in general but he s OK in this movie There were two plot lines in this movie one about a kid who throws rocks through windshields of moving vehicles and the other about a woman with a moustache Let s face it this movie has no freaking idea of what it wanted to say or where it wanted to go THe characters story lines intertwine on some levels but are in no means worthy of being included in a script The whole thing is weak and pointless and then there is an occasional OK scene But overall Don t bother unless you love irish accents so much that you can watch mediocrity and it is rescued by everyone sounding like the Lucky Charms elf an American fetish that has catapulted some truly crappy movies to success
A terrible film which is supposed to be an independent one It needed some dependence on something br br This totally miserable film deals with the interactions among Irish people Were they trying to imitate the wonderful film Crash If so this film crashed entirely br br There is just too much going on here culminated by a little brat running around and throwing rocks into buses and cars which obviously cause mayhem br br The film is just too choppy to work One woman loses her husband after 14 years to another while her younger sister is ripped off by a suitor This causes the former sister to become a bitter vetch and walk around in clothes not worth believing The older sister also becomes embittered but soon finds romance br br Then we have 3 losers who purchase masks to rob a bank Obviously the robbery goes awry but there doesn t seem to be any punishment for the crooks Perhaps the punishment should have been on the writers for failure to create a cohesive film
I live in Ottawa where this film was made and I really wish it hadn t been This is one God awful flick I really try and support independent films but there is this stigma attached to anything indie and that stigma is Indie Films Blow Well this film does nothing to shed this curse The actor writer director Brett Kelly does little to contribute to the genre rather he re hashes tired clichés from movies past I am really tired of menacing evil looking characters that lurk in the shadows and prey on the unsuspecting it s way too overdone br br I can remember one scene in particular right near the end of the flick where the whole scene is lit with car headlights Now some may say that this was an effect used to create mood and tension but sadly it was to showcase the shoestring budget of this movie As well for a movie that dares to call itself horror a viewer will find themselves hard pressed to find any actual gore other than a few scenes with corn syrup and red food colouring br br The biggest thing that drags this film down is the pacing and the lack of character development the basic plot is that children are being kidnapped and the parents must track down this Bonesetter fellow before a certain time in order to get their kids back Not that this concept bugs me but I didn t really find it believable that when the two main characters both who have lost children can find time to make out with each other This is done in such a short time span that it s inconceivable my first priority would be to get my daughter back and at least get to know the lady before making out with her br br The last point that I have is and I won t hold this against Kelly but the movie is shot entirely on boring emotionless video and that really takes away from any tense moments that would have just oozed style on film Although if this movie were given a million dollar makeover and redone the story and boring acting and lame everything could not keep this movie afloat My only hope is that something happens to prevent Brett Kelly from making a sequel which has been reported on his website a sequel that was half written in one sitting br br Lord help us all
Usually when a movie receives a vote of one it is because someone simply dislikes it and is annoyed it doesn t have a lower rating and so decides to drag it down as much as they can instead of just giving it a low rating This is not the case here br br Bonesetter is a perfect example of a 0 10 film It does nothing right and it doesn t have the chance to because it doesn t really attempt to do anything There are strands of a bad D D novel kind of plot which doesn t hold together and a complete lack of any kind of acting throughout It is clear that nobody involved in this project gave it any kind of serious effort because even a completely patently untalented persons hard work would amount to more A truly awful film
Words cannot begin to describe how blandly terrible this movie is I wish it were so bad it s good but it s not It s just dull lifeless and boring It s so bad I couldn t even laugh at it br br In response to other posters Anne Marie Frigon is not the highlight of the movie The only person less charismatic is the director Brett Kelly who as a true statement on vanity cast himself as the male lead They both look like inbreeds sister and brother br br The gal Sherry Thurig is a looker The complete opposite of Anne Marie attractive This girl is tall and willowy and can act Although you can tell she s holding back br br All the actors seem to be holding back especially the supporting male Mark I ve seen less wood in a rain forest but he s still better than Kelly Why would Kelly keep his actors from acting Is he really that bad a director Everyone else has summed the story up perfectly there isn t one Kids are kidnapped and Kelly steps in poo to solve the crime I know how he felt stepping in the poo it s how I felt after watching his movie br br Yes I tried to get my money back from the rental store This is a home movie best left to be seen by the friends of the director and if you search them out you ll see those same friends were the one who gave the movie positive marks
A truly frightening film Feels as if it were made in the early 90s by a straight person who wanted to show that gays are good normal mainstream aspiring people Retrograde to the point of being offensive LTR suggests that monogamy and marriage are the preferred path to salvation for sad lonely sex crazed gays Wow Who knew The supporting characters are caricatures of gay stereotypes the effeminate buffoon the bitter lonely queen the fag hag etc and the main characters are milquetoast middle class middlebrow clones of little interest br br As far as the romantic ideological struggles of the main couple are concerned there s not much to say we ve seen it all before and done much better
Or listening to for that matter Even the soundtrack is a bore br br Honestly this isn t the worst gay movie I ve seen that would be Regarding Billy but it s down there very close to the bottom of the barrel br br This thing drags and drags and drags It s not that the plot is inane in the hands of a good writer it might have worked it certainly could have been much more entertaining There s not one plot point you can t see coming for ten miles down the road The dialog is flat The jokes are old To add insult to injury it s full of one dimensional stereotypical gays br br Nothing in this movie convinced me that the situation or the relationship of the two leads was possible much less real There was no chemistry no dynamic in fact no evidence of why the leads love each other we re just told they re in love Hard to figure when they have nothing in common and aren t compatible sexually They like the same book Huh br br The acting is not totally bad but the pacing is excruciatingly slow I mean almost Jarmusch slow but without Jarmusch quality In fact that would be a good barometer for you If you like Jarmusch films avoid this one
Movie had some good acting and good moments though obviously pretty low budget but bad rating due to basic premise being badly developed The main point of conflict between the two leads doesn t play out in a realistic manner at all There are a few scenes where they disagree because of it but no discussions of any great depth that would explain how they can be together while seeing the world so differently especially since the employment of Glenn is so wound up in this part of his life and Adam is active enough with his that he supports it with time and money Also several times Glenn is portrayed negatively for being the way he is apologizing to Adam for his past while Adam is shown to be upstanding and traditional which the film proclaims to be the good way in the end I don t like being preached to like that I attended a discussion session with the director after viewing LTR and he said that he presented this conflict between them because if he was in Glenn s shoes and he said he does in real life relate to Glenn s view that he could never date someone with Adam s views Well then I think he should have done a much better job explaining how Glenn could do it in the film Also director said he directed this his first movie only after reading Directing For Dummies Directing was not that bad but far from a top notch effort I ve seen worse but I rarely leave films feeling this frustrated
When this play was first shown by the BBC over 30 years ago it would have been something quite different for the time So therefor some people would have found it quite scary and may well have been impressed with the special effects br br Looking at the play in this day and age It doesn t seem to be all that scary anymore even the special effects can leave a lot to be desired br br Would a train really be allowed to pass a RED LIGHT into a dark tunnel I don t think so but if you watch this play again you will observe that the first train that enters the tunnel rushes straight through the RED LIGHT maybe that s how it was in dickens time br br You will also notice that the footpath that leads down to the Signal Box is very steep and in a poor state Surely there would have been a series of proper steps with handrails for the Signalman to climb up or down into the cutting i can t help but notice things like that br br I will not take anything away from the acting both Denholm Elliott signalman and Bernard Lloyd the traveller gave wonderful performances br br I am not at all sure what is going on I mean was the ghost the traveller or what Does anyone really fully understand this rather confusing story well maybe i am the only one that don t br br To sum up br br The play has a wonderful atmosphere throughout with great character It suffers from not being that scary these days and a little if not very confusing in places and has some rather unusual signalling practises br br Thanks for reading my review
I watched this movie for its two hours and have absolutely no idea what it s about Somebody got murdered or maybe they didn t and maybe somebody did it or maybe they didn t This brought back memories of the good old days bad old days when all CBC Canadian movies were stinkers Lately stinkers have been the exception but this confused hodge podge of trendy feminism mind reeling flash backs and mumbled dialogue makes up for lost time I ve never found Margaret Atwood s books easy to read This movie continues that fine Canadian tradition It isn t easy to watch Maybe the trendy folks at the chi chi Toronto cocktail parties will pretend they liked it Us folks in the boonies are a little less pretentious
I don t know what Margaret Atwood was thinking to allow this movie to have the same name as her book I ve always been a big fan of The Robber Bride and was so excited to learn there was a movie in the works I am aware that the translation of book to movie isn t perfect but this movie was the worst ever The names of the women are correct and some of the back story is correct but that is about it I feel like I lost a good portion of my time trying to make it through this movie This really should have been a mini series to tell the story the way it was written br br The actors for Roz Tony Charis and Zenia were well chosen even though I was skeptical at first about Mary Louise Parker I only wish they d had a better script to work with because this really had nothing to do with the book at all
When I saw that Mary Louise Parker was associated with this epic novel turned film I was intrigued Being a fan of the book I assumed she d be playing Tony Roz or Charis but more so I was intrigued to see how they would turn this very head y almost psychological but not psychological thriller novel in to a movie that would be accessible to those who hadn t read the novel and that would be at least mildly satisfying for those who had The book is a complex reflection of society women and modern life and I was interested to see how they used the 3 different narratives that lead to the unfolding of the story in a film What they actually did was a crime br br The biggest error and confusing issue is Why would Oxygen a network that advertises as being for women take an amazing book about how complex wonderful and terrible women are and can be and change the protagonist from 3 women to some dumb former cop with no real motive to be involved in the story It seems like whoever adapted it took an easy way out by using this guy to straight up ask Roz Tony and Charis about how they knew Zenia and in doing that they rushed through bulk of the book In doing this though they muddied the story and cut everything that is great about the characters in it aside from making it so the audience had no one credible to associate with In the film these women aren t people they are characters br br In the book Zenia does fake her death but the book mentions it to get this point across while the film wastes 30 45 minutes focusing on this former cop running around and doing nothing of use They tried to make this complex book an episode of Law and Order or CSI br br It turns out that Mary Louise Parker played Zenia which was SO wrong Zenia is a Catherine Zeta Jones Angelina Jolie or maybe even a Scarlett Johnasson type She is a woman men can t not adore and a woman that women are intrigued and threatened by but in a keep your enemies closer kind of way And once she gets closer she seems totally genuine and trust worthy despite your better judgment She s the kind of woman who even when she loses she wins she s always still beautiful still rich and there are always still people out there who don t know her game br br In the film Zenia didn t take Charis s man the blonde American draft dodger who was using Charis in the first place but instead took August and tried to become her legal guardian and apparently came back to be her Lesbian lover as a lingering kiss at the coffee shop implies And Zenia did kill the chickens before leaving with August but it made no sense since all of the build up to it was removed It s was as if whoever wrote the screenplay was grasping at straws to satisfy those of us who read the book but I think had I not read the book I would have spent the whole movie confused if I had bothered to stick with it at all br br And Roz s husband was dead before Zenia came in to the picture which was weird since Zenia took Roz s business AND home life in the book which is why Roz hated her so much and she and Zenia had conspired to kill Roz s husband years and years back And according to the film Tony and West had been dating forever even at the party where Zenia and West in the book had painted the whole place black and they made Tony seem like this totally with it and evil bitchy person who was always respected by everyone for her intelligence and popular for it Tony s character was SO wrong in this film she seemed a little psycho and like the mastermind behind whatever conspiring was going down as opposed to the kind of gawky mildly reclusive teacher that she was in the book The film basically implied smart women are evil beautiful women are evil powerful women are evil and women who teach yoga are off their rockers br br They basically tried to make it so Zenia wasn t necessarily as awful as she was in the book and then in the end the three women convince this former cop who of course in the process of researching this meets Zenia and has an affair with her that is supposed to end with them moving to Barbados or something ridiculous which of course Zenia bails on to hide Zenia s body which they found splat at the hotel she was staying at but the film implies that one of the three women pushed her over the balcony or they conspired together to do it and then Zenia also managed to take all of Roz s money in the process By the end of the film I was only half paying attention between commercials b c it had spiraled so far out in space from what it could and should have been br br If you aren t confused by this breakdown of the film then maybe you would like it because I have read the book and seen the movie and from the movie alone I am ridiculously confused It was terrible I get that making a film out of that book is quite a task but if you are going to take on the task you should start by determining what in the book is unnecessary instead of creating some useless character to be our Alice in wonderland br br Are there really no fluffier books that Oxygen could be making at least half decent TV movies of
I greatly enjoyed Margaret Atwood s novel The Robber Bride and I was thrilled to see there was a movie version A woman frames a cop boyfriend for her own murder and his buddy an ex cop journalist tries to clear his name by checking up on the dead woman s crazy female friends It s fortunate that the movie script fixes Ms Atwood s clumsy plotting by focusing on the story of these two men victims of scheming women br br Heh Okay you got me If these guys are mentioned in the book and I m pretty sure they re entirely made up for the movie I ll eat the dust cover of my hardback copy Apparently the three main female characters of the novel aren t enough to carry the movie Zenia s manipulations aren t interesting unless we see them happen to a man and a man s life is screwed up Roz Charis and Toni tell their stories to a man Because it s not important if a man doesn t hear them br br I liked the characters in the book It hurts to see them pushed off to the side for a man s story I normally do not look for feminist angles on media and I tried to enjoy the movie as is If I hadn t read the book I might have enjoyed the movie a lot more So if you like the cop and the ex cop and you want to read more about them you re out of luck Read the novel if you want to enjoy luscious prose and characterization subtly layered through a plot It s the same plot the movie excavated it ironed it and sprinkled it with male angst It s like Zenia s revenge on Margaret Atwood
If I had never read the book I would have said it was a good movie BUT I did read the book Who ever did the screen write ruined the storyline There is so many changes that it wasn t really worthy of the Title Character changes plot changes time line changes br br First off who was Henry and the investigator They weren t in the story Henry had Mitch s persona somewhat but Mitch wasn t a cop No you made it so Roz helped sink his body and used that as Zenia s blackmail against Roz The real so called blackmail was Roz thought Zenia was sleeping with her son and wanted her to get away from him Her son was also being blackmailed because he was hiding being Gay from his mother Her son wasn t even really mentioned in the story Neither I don t believe was his lover Roz s secretary br br Tony and West were not together in the beginning He was actually with Zenia first while in college The black painted apartment was their Idea Tony just went to visit This is where Zenia and Tony meet become fast friends Tony hides her love for West Then Zenia left west with cash from Tony then West and Tony get together Eventually marry at some point West leaves Tony for Zenia again for a short time Only to be heart broken again Then go back to Tony Zenia s blackmail for Tony was that Tony had written a test paper for Zenia Now being a Professor at College she didn t want to let it get out I will say the character who played Tony did it wonderfully br br Charis character was a blond not that it really matters Zenia didn t trick her about having cancer while Augusta was alive No she was there when Charis had a lover named billy Augusta s father he was a draft dodger in the Vietnam war Eventually after Charis takes care of Zenia for months for what was actually drug withdrawal Zenia and Billy have an affair right under Charis s nose while taking care of them both Then Zenia turns in Billy to the government and leaves on the ferry with him Not with Augusta Charis was pregnant with her tho Charis also had a split personality Karen was her real name br br Zenia did not die from being cut up into piece s she fell or was possibly pushed we never really knew off the balcony and landed in a fountain She had almost pure grade heroin in her blood and it was likely she took some not knowing and fell off as she OD d She was also really dieing of Cancer this time around br br It didn t show any of the childhood memories or anything that endeared the characters to the reader The Book was striped down to its bare bones Then re made in someone else s vision Why couldn t you just write your own story along the lines of what you made the movie It was different enough and I m sure could have been made more so
Warning no plot spoilers ahead but movie spoilers nonetheless My significant other rented this for me thinking it would be a terrific romance with an all star cast Wow very very wrong This movie is an overdone overwrought and overly sentimental excuse to theatrically release a student film 15 years after it was shot The copyright date on the box said 2005 yet during the very first flashback sequence I was looking at the clothes and hairdos that were supposed to be the early 1960s and noticed that the girls especially were wearing late 80s early 90s dresses and hairdos It looked as if it had been shot a good 15 or 20 years before the rest of the film I tried to convenience myself that it was a flashback and therefore supposed to look old but it looked WWWWWWWAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYY more 80s than 60s or even 21st century trying to be 60s then an adult coworker of the lead character turns up and he looks just like the boy featured in the flashback sequences yet it s a different much older character whose youth is featured in the flashbacks I was completely confused until I saw in the special features the short film included it was all the flashback sequences shot in 1990 as a complete student film of the same title as this movie It also features commentary that includes the little boy all grown up and indeed acting the co worker in the 2005 scenes Thus this movie is just a shell of story woven around an old re cut student film put together as an obvious excuse to get it up to theatrical running time The shell story shot in 2005 is mostly about a man who has lost his wife and finds healing and redemption at the dance class that he promises a dying man he will attend in his stead something about a promise made by the dying man in the early 60 s to his girl that they would meet on the fifth day of the fifth month of the fifth year of the new millennium an excuse to shoot the segments around the old film in 2005 These new scenes and plot might have been OK except the awful overly sentimental score that repeats ad nauseum over almost every single new scene and the clichéd action that permeates the new movie Don t bother There s a reason why you ve never heard of this movie even though it has a well known cast it s terrible
I ended up watching this whole very long movie because I was fascinated by the sheer stupidity and naivity of it It seems difficult to believe that so many famous people Anthony Quinn Lawrence Olivier John Gielguld Vittorio de Sica etc would have willingly participated in this farce But maybe in 1968 people really were so naive The plot seems written by some confused Latin American Marxist priest with an agenda There is a superpower conflict and the Russians are actually the good guys with the Communist Party General Secretary being a nice and spiritual man who suddenly after 20 years sees the light and feels compelled to ease his bad conscience by releasing a prisoner priest from a Siberian gulag The priest then promptly becomes the Pope by a series of coincidences We are allowed to see the secret Vatican papal voting process which is portrayed in the most hillariously pious form you can possibly imagine br br Meanwhile the communists in China achieved the usual socialist economic miracle of starving half of their country to death To solve this minor hiccup on the relentless shining path towards communism they want to start a nuclear war in order to justly distribute the Western capitalist riches to the poor workers of China br br Our good old comrade General Secretary gets a bit worried and calls the Pope just before his coronation to ask him to broker peace They meet with the Chinese leader comrade Peng who looks and acts like a 15 year old boy You will roll on the floor laughing about what people in 1968 thought the Chinese looked like Comrade Peng demands that the Western capitalists must pay which is quite logical after all don t capitalists always have to pay for the madness of the socialists and that the Pope needs to sacrifice something too for the common altruistic cause of equality and social justice br br So when the Pope gets crowned in Rome he pledges the entire wealth of the Catholic church world wide to feed our poor Chinese brethren in Christ And thus he saves the world from nuclear holocaust br br Apart from this there are also some minor sub plots which alas provide little to redeem this incredibly bad movie I d give it three Oscars for stupidity br br By the way Anthony Quinn looks quite unlikely as a Pope He is much more plausible as Zorba the Greek
My brother is an avid DVD collector He took one look at the cover two models on toilets and had to add it to his collection I stayed up with him to watch what turned out to be likely the most cringeable movie I use that term loosely I ve felt obligated to sit through I dared not make eye contact with my brother quite certain he must have been cursing the receipt in his clenched fist The biggest name in the whole movie is Michael Clark Duncan who appears in one scene which the filmmaker decided to show every take of about four total throughout the movie In fact the whole movie pretty much follows this suit The fact that the DVD contained deleted footage was a shock I went to bed without viewing it however To no surprise at all I found this disc without its case behind the TV about a week later
The Underground Comedy Movie is possibly the worst train wrecks I ve ever seen Luckily I didn t pay for this movie and my friend reluctantly agreed to watch it again siting that it was so awful but he needed to prove to me how awful it was I love off color comedy I figured at the least it would have that and I would be entertained No instead the acting was so awful the jokes were extremely cheesy and the plot was no where to be found Maybe there wasn t supposed to be a plot so I can t hold that against this movie It s pretty sad where the funniest thing in a comedy is an old woman having her head hit off by a bat by Batman A man dressed in a baseball uniform wielding a bat Hilarious Simply genius I got the feeling watching this movie that its creators made it and laughed hysterically with their friends about it Perhaps this was full of inside jokes we just didn t understand Or perhaps it s the worst piece of trash ever made and it should be locked away in a vault and dumped in the Arctic Ocean br br P S Don t buy this movie
Sure we all like bad movies at one time or another and we in fact enjoy them This however wasn t even a guilty pleasure it was just crap Some guy vince offer who is conceited enough to make himself the main character while probably got drunk high probably both and thought it was a great idea to make a movie He then proceeded to show his script to equally high drunk individuals Overall this movie was so bad predictable and unoriginal I couldn t get through 20 minutes of it before I turned it off It makes You Got Served look like Citizen Kane Bat Man WTF Some guy that walks around with a bat real original Almost as good as calling him Fat Man and having a fat guy walk around in a superhero outfit
Sometimes you wonder how some people get funding to create a movie as bad as this one You can only stand about 5 minutes of this utter piece of garbage before you stomp back into blockbuster and demand your money back I will now look at Michael Clarke Duncan with apprehension why he lent his name to this vermin
Anyone who has watched Comedy Central around midnight in the past few years has probably seen ads for this movie I first saw ads for this movie back in 2001 It looked like it could be funny but I wasn t about to call up the number on the television screen and order it without seeing the movie first I figured I would wait until the movie was available to rent at Blockbuster br br About a year and a half later I was at Tower Records and in the DVDS for less than 20 pile there was a copy of this movie Seeing that the DVD was only 6 99 I decided to buy it I got home put the disc in the DVD player and waited for the laughs to start and I waited some more The laughs never came br br I d have to agree with almost every other comment on this page when I say that this movie was horrible Sick desperately tasteless and poorly written and directed THE UNDERGROUND COMEDY MOVIE is an atrocious piece of garbage and is in my opinion the worst movie of all time No stars
The Underground Comedy movie is perhaps one of the worst comedies I ve ever seen I should have known it was going to be bad when the box had the phrase guaranteed to offend written on it meaning that the filmmakers were going to focus more on grossing you out than making you laugh br br This movie is an amateurish jumble of childish skits bad characters and worse jokes from the pathetic Bat Man sketch to the painfully unfunny Arnold Shvollenpecker skit they just aren t funny The few skits that are a little funny are few and far between watching Micheal Clark Duncan play a gay virgin for example but even they go on too long and get ruined from Vince Offer s ineptness at comedy br br Keep The Underground Comedy Movie underground bury it
First of all br br What the hell Why in the world are they trying to sell a low budget piece of crap on late night TV with the promise of disturbing offensive sick garbage that any normal real human being with a soul couldn t watch br br What the crap is funny about a dog being injured a grandma getting her head knocked off a guy getting his hand blown to pieces and two girls going to the bathroom what in the hell has this world come to that people find comedy in some thing so completely sick Anyone who thinks this kind of material is funny should not even be allowed to walk the earth br br But from what I hear its not even offensive so they promise comedy through demented piles of sick garbage and they cant even pull that off
This movie goes beyond just being bad it is definitively the worst movie I have ever seen in my entire life Unless you yourself have a problem with necrophilia than you will not enjoy will not enjoy the scenes depicting it in this film if you can call it that
Imagine the worst skits from Saturday Night Live and Mad TV in one 90 minute movie Now imagine that all the humor in those bad skits is removed and replaced with stupidity Now imagine something 50 times worse br br Got that br br Ok now go see The Underground Comedy Movie That vision you just had will seem like the funniest thing ever UCM is the single worst movie I ve ever seen There were a few cheap laughs very few But it was lame Even if the intent of the movie was to be lame it was too lame to be funny br br The only reason I m not angry for wasting my time watching this was someone else I know bought it He wasted his money Vince Offer hasn t written or directed anything else and it s not surprise why
Words cannot describe how utterly abysmal this movie is It is a series of random unfunny clips about everything from a stupid Batman spoof to a guy getting it on with an old dead lady REALLY disturbing The only remotely amusing thing about the Underground Comedy Movie is watching Joey Buttafuoco the best actor in this movie Also it is rated NC 17 shunning away the only people that might tolerate it
I have never seen a comedy that was this much of a chore to sit thru not one laugh in it Ok maybe one little chuckle for the Michael Clarke Duncan bit as the big black bald gay virgin But the rest of it was shockingly un funny On top of being void of any laughs the skits go on forever Steer clear of this one if you value your time and money DREADFUL The worst
Hawked as THE MOST OFFENSIVE MOVIE EVER GUARANTEED TO OFFEND EVERYONE Guess what It worked I m offended that we shelled out money to rent this Two friends and I were bored and decided to see if all that bull about the movie that we saw on TV was true Curse Comedy Central and all the other networks that pushed this garbage on us It was by far the worst movie I ve seen since Hollow Man I generally avoid the crappy ones but got sucked into this one We have since beaten the prick who suggest we rent it and his movie picking privileges have been revoked There is nothing remotely funny about this movie even the adventures of dickman scene was sophomoric at best Color me p ed Thought maybe the production value was crap for some important reason no it just sucked NEVER WATCH THIS for any reason whatsoever Not even with copious amounts of illegal substance would this movie be funny That s saying ALOT Please for the love of all that is holy if you cherish your sanity never view this movie It s many things stupid pointless and worthless to name a few But the main thing it was aiming for offensively funny it failed miserably Crash and burn
How do I begin This movie is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen It has no redeemable qualities I just sat through this movie and it was a struggle It failed to get even a single smile on my face I find it hard to believe that anyone would distribute this horrible film I felt that this movie was a failed attempt at distasteful humor The only thing that was worth anything about this movie was the soundtrack I m pretty sure thats the reason I wanted to see this movie in the first place I will wrap this up as I am going to try and forget the time I just wasted with this piece of crap I will leave you with this warning DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM IT SUCKS
It really impresses me that it got made The director writer actor must be really charismatic in reality I can think of no other way itd pass script stage What I want you to consider is this while watching the films I was feeling sorry for the actors It felt like being in a stand up comedy club where the guy is dying on his feet and your sitting there not enjoying it just feeling really bad for him coz hes of trying Id really like to know what the budget is guess it must have been low as the film quality is really poor I want to write the jokes didn t appeal to me but the reality is for them to appeal to you you d have to be the man who wrote them or a retard So imagine that in script form and this guy got THAT green lit Thats impressive isn t it
This movie shows a row of sketches which partly pass over into one another I realized the passing over late in the movie at first it only irritated me br br Many of the episodes in this movie come along without any recognizable punchlines and simply try to wangle around that fact using absurdity and obscenity The attempt of it to stay comedy without any funny bits fails br br My personnel and maybe subjective result after watching this movie My god it hurts in my head every time I call it movie A bold attempt to turn nothing into something great But it failed At least the director made something out of nothing But it isn t something good br br Many movies didn t turn out as funny as they were planned but this one tops them all It s the real life manifestation of the worst case scenario of film making No To correct myself it s even worse than that A movie with gags so bad that they aren t funny at all It s not even fun to watch the lead actor writer and director all three the same guy by the way perish by drowning in the sea of bad movies The movie is too bad for that
This film stars among others SlapChop Vince Offer who also wrote edited and directed and Joey Buttafuoco not exactly names that scream out quality And with such uplifting skits as Supermodels taking a dump it s exactly what it sounds like a guy who robs a sperm bank the Rhymer necrophilia with a rotting corpse black market fetuses featuring a guy scooping what are supposed to be them out of a jar lots and lots of gay jokes a skit about a giant phallus who is a superhero and forced abortions The skits are painfully unfunny such as Batman and Rhymer the acting not good enough to be considered amateurish and the film is crude just for the sake of being crude and stupid I truly believe a group of 8 year olds could have EASILY made a funnier film with the same budget br br Apparently this film resulted in a lawsuit by Slap Shot Vince against the Scientologists Frankly I wouldn t know who to root for in this case Apparently he alleged that somehow Scientologists destroyed his reputation and sank this film No matter that the film is repellent junk from start to finish and 99 unfunny by comparison Ebola is funnier and these are the nicest things I can say about the movie br br By the way that IS Bobby Lee from Mad TV wearing a diaper and participating in the dumb fake porno film It s amazing his career could overcome this
Lately they have been trying to hock this film late night on cable TV commercials Don t believe the hype I was one of the unlucky people to see this stinker in theatres This is in my opinion the 3rd Worst Movie of All Time just behind Mac Me 1 Worst and Jack Frost 2 Worst but I must admit they are all close and all TERRIBLE Really nothing of this movie is funny or disturbing or anything else it claims to be so don t waste your money The only thing it is good for is giving to your worst enemy I m not lying about that Someone who you would love to kill or torture would be a prime candidate for this film It is that awful If you don t believe me then you deserve to suffer through the misery of watching this which I doubt you can finish Two Thumbs Enthusiastically Down
I bought this at tower records after seeing the info mercial about fifteen hundred times on comedy central I was actually really looking forward to watching this My god where did i go wrong Now before i give my review let me just say that i am a person who can pretty much find the good in all movies hell i own over 1 500 dvd s With that said the underground comedy movie ranks up there with the worst film i have EVER seen I tried to give it a chance but not only was it not funny It had no point did not offend what so ever and was all around stupid God who in their right mind thought these pieces of crap were funny this is going right to the bottom of the bin
I rated this movie as AWFUL 1 After watching the trailer I thought this movie could be pretty cool Guaranteed to offend everyone the trailer said Well it did offend me because this movie really sucks It is hardly a comedy as I laughed about two seconds during the entire movie And what s with all the gays in this movie I m not gay and I don t have a problem with those who are but what s the point of adding so many gay scenes in a so called comedy movie when these scenes are absolutely not funny I guess the director is a gay man in denial or something like that br br So my advice to you is if you want to waste good money go rent a good comedy you ve already seen a million times you ll be better off than watching this Mother Of All Lousy Comedy s It really is total crap
This movie doesn t even deserve a one This was an utter waste of time It was a waste of film and money It was not offensive but everything was provocative and disgusting My spoiler is one that I think should be read by everyone There is full frontal nudity and disgusting language But not only that there is NO plot line the actors are terrible the accents are horrible the actors are small time and I was even EXCITED to watch this movie br br The only reason I rented it was for Brian van Holt who got only a fifteen second part by the way I think this might have been a mistake on the directors and editors parts but they repeated the same segments two or three times adding only a new sentence br br A film similar to this is Eraser Head possibly the most disturbing movie in existence There is no plot line and is not funny Although it isn t trying to be funny DO NOT WATCH EITHER MOVIE
A series of painfully unfunny skits that seem to go on forever and a day Not as mind numbingly awful as say Freddy Got Fingered or Lost Reality but that in NO way is an endorsement in ANY way sense or form Features the worst rhyming clown ever Any most if it isn t offensive to anybody but the most prudish or politically correct It also has the worst song parody EVER put on film the WORST Arnold impersonation EVER not just the worst put on film literally the worst EVER I have NO clue why Karen Black Micheal Clarke Duncan or Slash would star in this the reasons I watched this in the first place The only thing mildly amusing was Dickman In conclusion I would t recommend this film to ANYONE but the people who are making it their mission in life to get this in the Bottom 250 on this site are pathetic Do something notable with you lives people Plus if it s true the Church of Scientalogy hates him he can t be ALL bad br br My Grade D
And I repeat please do not see this movie This is more than a review This is a warning This sets the record for the worst most effortless comedy ever made At least with most of the recent comedies nowadays the gags are crude and flat but the writers and directors put in at least some sort of effort into making them funny I never get tired of repeating one of my favorite mottos Everyone thinks they can do comedy and only 10 percent of them are right Comedy is hard This is not some genre any fool can play around with I think it s atrocious that the filmmakers are comparing this piece of garbage to Kentucky Fried Movie Basically these bozos are comparing their so called comic talents to those of the brilliant Jim Abrahams and the Zucker Brothers Come on I ve seen Pauly Shore movies that are 10 times funnier than The Underground Comedy Movie Here s a sample of the comedy for those curious about seeing this movie One sketch involves a superhero dressed like a penis named D kman The whole joke is that he defeats his enemies by squirting them with semen That s it That s the whole joke Wow This is enough to make Carrot Top roll his eyes Another sketch involves a man having sex with a dead person in a porn movie And in another sketch there s a bag lady beauty contest in which we re exposed to the horrible sights of bikini clad middle aged women with beer guts and stretch marks Plus making fun of the homeless is more sad than funny It s a step away from mocking the mentally handicapped The whole movie is supposed to be a satire I think the filmmakers forgot that a key element of satire is TRUTH For anybody who actually enjoyed this crap explain to me what is truthful about ANY of these gags Some of the sketches might ve sounded funny on paper but anybody who s taken any screen writing classes knows that if a sight gag sounds too funny on paper it probably won t be funny on screen If I tell someone about a big black muscular gay virgin who s saving himself for the right man he or she would probably laugh But watching the premise played out on screen for about 10 minutes is a complete drag I hate how whenever people criticize a low brow comedy like this for not being funny they re regarded as stuck up squares I just saw White Chicks recently That s another low brow politically incorrect comedy but I laughed my head off The most offensive thing about The Underground Comedy Movie is it s not funny What the writers and directors don t understand is that merely being filthy and tasteless doesn t work There has to be more Just think of the famous scene from There s Something About Mary ironically enough the bozo filmmakers put the Farrellys on their special thanks list The joke about the semen wasn t just funny because it involved bodily fluids There was a buildup Ben Stiller was masturbating in the bathroom to make sure he didn t go out on a date with a loaded gun Then he looked around to see where all the semen went after it was released A knock is on the door and he has to answer it His date Mary is at the door and that s when it s revealed that the semen is hanging off Ben s ear In this movie there are multiple gags involving characters squirting loads of semen at people with no buildup whatsoever As Jay Leno always says This comedy thing s not so easy is it Keep that in mind Vince Offer cause you weren t cut out for this genre The only reason people might laugh at these gags is because they want to feel hip Let s face it nowadays it s hip to laugh at anything politically incorrect I know comedy is subjective but this movie shouldn t be funny to anybody except maybe the filmmakers themselves As a side note the movie had to have been made before Michael Clarke Duncan s fame in movies like Armageddon and The Green Mile There can t be any other reason why an actor of his caliber would volunteer to be part of this amateurish freak show All the others in the cast are either non actors has been actors or B movie stars Karen Black made a good impression in Five Easy Pieces but I don t think she s done anything of value ever since Slash was probably drugged into being in this film Gina Lee Nolin is nothing without Baywatch Angelyne is the film s biggest star keeping in mind Duncan wasn t famous at the time and there are still probably a ton of people who haven t heard of her for good reason Usually I m in support of extremely low budget flicks but this one deserves to drift into obscurity I hope to Lord this doesn t become a cult classic Shouldn t there be a law against distributing crap like this
I m into bad movies but this has NOTHING going for it Despite what the morons above have said it is NOT funny I know comedy AND underground movies but this is so boring that the Director Writer should be prohibited from EVER directing anything but local cable access EVER again To love movies and comedy is to despise this film I may never get over how unfunny and boring this work was If you like this movie you ARE a pothead as sober there is NOTHING here ZERO If you need to compare underground movies see Kentucky Fried Movie or early John Waters The movie starts by defining satire and I defy anyone to show me the satire The rule for comedy is THIS If it s FUNNY you can say or do ANYTHING but if it s NOT funny you are not satirical you are not edgy you are merely pathetic and this movie is simply not funny ZERO
This is the worst movie I ve ever seen in my life This is saying quite a bit considering some of the choices I ve made in film rentals br br I got this on netflix based entirely on the fact that someone I went to high school with is topless in it The topless scene lasted all of about 5 seconds and the rest of the movie was about as much fun as having pungee sticks driven underneath my toenails whilst being forced to listen to Roseanne sing Big Spender br br The skits are stupid and consist of the worst kind of juvenile bathroom humor and locker room gags and it s such a blatant and poor rip off of The Kentucky Fried Movie that you ll be begging for Big Jim Slade to crash through the wall and save us from the stupidity of Vince Offer whoever that is br br Unless you are a masochist avoid this pile of rubbish
I foolishly read the back of the DVD cover of this movie in Best Buy about a year ago and said to myself Seems funny plus it has Michael Clarke Duncan how can I lose I proceeded to pay 15 99 plus tax for it I took it over to a friends house and we both stood aghast at how poorly it was written and acted Wooden performances abound All the hilarious and outstanding performances promised never seemed to arrive After 90 minutes I hung my head in shame knowing that I could never get that 90 minutes or 15 99 back I literally almost cried as well because if that was what could be considered comedy I didn t want to believe in movies anymore My friend and I constantly informed a friend of ours of the horror of this movie to the point that he needed to see it just to understand how bad it was Over the holiday season this year I watched it with him because he didn t want to watch it alone This was my next horrible mistake because as I watched I just became angry I began to yell at the movie and I m not one to talk to movies period Everyone I know that has even glimpsed this movie has agreed its the worst they ve ever seen My sense of humor is sick and twisted and often offends my friends but that could not save this movie even The fact that this movie is not on the bottom 100 list on IMDb is astounding The fact that its rating at the time of this writing is 3 6 is a crime against humanity
Imagine the worst skits from Saturday Night Live and Mad TV in one 90 minute movie Now imagine that all the humor in those bad skits is removed and replaced with stupidity Now imagine something 50 times worse br br Got that br br OK now go see The Underground Comedy Movie That vision you just had will seem like the funniest thing ever UCM is the single worst movie I ve ever seen There were a few cheap laughs very few But it was lame Even if the intent of the movie was to be lame it was too lame to be funny br br The only reason I m not angry for wasting my time watching this was someone else I know bought it He wasted his money Vince Offer hasn t written or directed anything else and it s no surprise why
A woman s nightmares fuel her fear of being buried alive The cheating husband wants her dead and decides to make good use of her phobia by sticking her in a coffin and leaving her in the basement Of course B horror movie queen Brinke Stevens transforms into hideous ghostly creature The only reason to see this amateurish junk flick is Michael Berryman in a really small cameo and two sex scenes with Delia Sheppard And the last twenty minutes of Brinke s bloody rampage are quite fun to watch The special effects for example laughable decapitated head are truly awful Better watch Scalps or Alien Dead again Of course I ain t expecting classy entertainment from Fred Olen Ray but Haunting Fear is too dull to be enjoyable
I purchased this video quite cheaply ex rental thinking that the cover looked quite nice And it was nice but the movie is trash I can handle B grade I sometimes even enjoy a good B romp ie Surf Nazis Must Die is a classic example of how entertaining the genre can be but this was just bland bland bland Incredibly dull scenes were broken up too sparsely by good wholesome cheap porn and entertaining dream horror sequences This movie has very little to offer
Fred Olen Ray is a lousy director even as far as B movie directors go but Haunting Fear is probably one of his better films Yes it does butcher the great Poe story Premature Burial and yes it is badly paced and uneven throughout but it is also pretty entertaining Scream Queen Brinke Stevens is better than usual as a pretty fragile housewife whose worthless husband Jay Richardson is plotting to do away with her because he needs money to pay off a gangster played by Robert Quarry Delia Sheppard a veteran of many early 90s soft core movies actually gives the best performance in the film as a slutty mistress You will also enjoy small roles played by Karen Black as a psychic Robert Clarke as a doctor and Michael Berryman in a nice cameo in one of the better scenes The ending didn t make much sense
First off with names like Fred Olen Ray Brinke Stevens and Jan Michael Vincent plus distributors like Rhino and Troma on the video box you know what you re getting into with this one B movie mania If you re actually expecting to see a thriller based on Edgar Allan Poe then forget it and head straight for the excellent series of Roger Corman 60s Poe films This is pure unadulterated sleaze with just a pedestrian attempt at a plot similar to The Premature Burial complete with lots of R rated ready for video sex and nudity However it s certainly entertaining and fun in a slipshod kind of way br br Brinke who has three nude scenes in the first 30 minutes plays rich traumatized insomniac housewife Victoria Monroe whose fear of being prematurely entombed stems from her belief that the same fate befell her father Hoke Howell Her worthless husband Terry Jay Richardson has racked up some serious gambling debt owed to a gangster played by Robert Quarry and with help from his kinky blonde European accented sexpot secretary Lisa Delia Sheppard plots to do away with Brinke for her money Name value actress Karen Black drops in briefly wearing a blonde wig as a hypnotist she s way too talented to be playing an insignificant role like this 50s sci fi horror star Robert Clarke plays a doctor and family friend and Michael Berryman shows up for a decent nightmare sequence performing an autopsy on a still living Vicki Jan Michael Vincent mostly sits outside a house in his car making goo goo eyes as Brinke enters and exits the home br br The kill a spouse for the inheritance plot has been done a million times before the ending is an unintentional laugh riot concluding with a direct rip off of the Zuni Fetish Doll segment in TRILOGY OF TERROR and whoever created the awful stabbed face and decapitated head FX for this release needs to sharpen up on their skills a bit Brinke does a decent job making her character somewhat sympathetic but the biggest surprise of all is how good former Penthouse Pet Delia Sheppard is in her role She stole every scene she was in and easily gave the standout performance here
Hallam Foe tells us the story about a boy who lost his mother and experiences some sort of Oedepus complex afterward br br It is something like 95 minutes long but would be better in ten There s like an hour in the middle where he is doing climbing practice on rooftops and habits in a church tower like Quasimodo only he is much less sympathetic br br There s a strange love story involved which doesn t have anything to do with anything She happens to look like his mother yes so what We know he misses his mother that s what the first ten minutes were about They should just have put the beginning and ending together and it would have been a O K short film Now it s a portrait of a character who doesn t change He is a guy that stuff happens to The only active choice he has in the whole middle of the movie is to apply for a job br br There s this whole Oedepus thing going on which is supposed to make us analyze his character He paints his face dresses in women s clothing and wears a dead Badger on his head A Badger You ve got to see the ending He returns to his home with the badger on his head and it is shot like a tacky Horror film to kill his dad s new wife which he had sex with in the beginning And somehow they thought this wouldn t be entertaining enough so they put some indie punk music in the background I ve got to admit though I m kind of allergic to films that want to write a psychological complex on your nose It feels like this MacKenzie director guy whatever is trying to show us that he also has been studying psychology in school You are so smart Thank you for bringing all these forgotten theories back into our memories You really dug What a Wallraff Okay so now I realized this film is based on some random book but anyway br br Photowise it is boring A lot of talking heads Plus the editor has changed the colors from scene to scene you know cold and warm etc why maybe Hallam Foe is both a feature and a test film for color blind people Or maybe they just thought that the drama wouldn t be enough to tell us that he feels lonely so they increased blue so that we really get it br br I m not even gonna comment on the cliché indie oh how how how cute drawings they have made in the presentation And all the cute sex stuff going on This whole film is an independent cliché But I do recommend it I laughed more than a few times Though it is really annoying to be a film student and to see how crap like this gets through the machine
In its way Mister Foe originally and more appropriately titled Hallam Foe I can t see addressing its title character as mister is a tribute to good acting Both Jamie Bell as Hallam a physically attractive voyeur creep and Sophia Myles as Kate his kinky partner in sex and fantasy romance are convincing The problem comes when you try to connect their roles to anything that happens in real life A young man who spies on the intimate details of people s lives the way Hallam does would be deservedly beaten to a pulp And a woman in Kate s situation would be repulsed and frightened she would probably call the police br br These things are not however what happens in the movie Poor Hallam s mother has died and his father married a woman with whom he s been having an affair Hallam of course hates his stepmother and lets he know it She has sex with him Kate s some kind of an employment person who places Hallam in a dish washing job and plays sexual games She looks like his birth mother It all ends happily with Hallam resolving his issues br br Forty some years ago the play and brilliantly acted movie Who s Afraid of Virginia Woolf had a similarly optimistic ending with characters becoming wiser and better after tearing each other apart The trouble is it doesn t always work that way especially when nobody really cares In Virginia Woolf the ending s plausible because of the intensity of the emotional revelation In Mister Foe the emotional revelation never really happens
David Mackenzie s follow up to the brilliant Young Adam wants to be a feel good underdog story of a lonely voyeur who is trying to confront some psycho sexual issues with his dead mother It wants to be gritty realistic and mysterious At the same time it wants to be funny and nonjudgmental of its disturbed lead as he establishes himself as an adult br br To meet this end the film tries hard to be youthful Its poster has hand drawn letters looking like that of Juno Its original soundtrack is comprised of fast paced indie rock which tries to convince the audience that Hallam is OK just a little misguided But strangely the film is anything but youthful br br Like Young Adam this film s central mystery concerns a drowned woman in this case Hallam s mother Young Adam keeps its mystery quiet contemplative and paced well enough to hit you with the truths as they come Hallam Foe does the opposite It foregrounds its character s psychosis so clearly and so early that he never really does anything outside his expected parameters The opening scene is Hallam in his treehouse watching his sister fooling around with her boyfriend Hallam swiftly interrupts asserting his presence in the household Here we see everything that Hallam will do for the rest of the movie br br The mystery surrounding his mother s drowning is whether it was suicide or murder by his father s girlfriend The audience can never really trust Hallam because besides being creepy we think his obsession has led him close to insanity This hindered the mystery element for me because Hallam is too sporadic to be relatable Right when he s found some clues that would support his claim he runs away from home at first it appearing to be looking for the police Then he gets extremely sidetracked by a girl who resembles his mother which frustratingly leads the story away from the mystery element br br While Jamie Bell does bring out some very endearing traits in his lost character he was limited by the obviousness of his psychological needs This movie is in no way mysterious yet it is not blunt either It tries to be realistic in dealing with such issues but it adds a very self conscious spunk which registers itself as quite the opposite It goes for a soundtrack heavy Trainspotting attitude to help the audience root for a protagonist who scales buildings picks locks and camps out for the sake of voyeurism These urban peeping tom adventures Hallam engages in are way too difficult for an inward drawn country boy to engage in and they are not sexy giddy or pleasant They are more neutral than anything not propelling the character or story Mackenzie makes you understand Hallam yet he fails to build common ground br br He expects you to enjoy Hallam s trials and tribulations without much ideological justification The film hinges on its audience s perspective on voyeurism the kind of person who engages in it Obviously most people would be disgusted by it And Hallam Foe realizes that but it does not let us see Hallam weigh the morality of his decisions He goes from person to person trying to fill his deep void There is a particularly disturbing line from Hallam s love interest Kate where she drunkenly says I love creepy boys perhaps asking the audience to do the same The line tries to foreshadow her understanding of him her motivation remains vague throughout and tries to further us from judging him It s not hard to like Hallam but it is very hard to participate in his adventure if it is even an adventure at all All the while the film tries to use its flamboyant soundtrack to mask its indecisive mood br br Great performances are weighed down by a film with a weak third act muddy development and needlessly ambiguous direction from Mackenzie Recently this film was re named for a US release and for what reason Not only is it more unappealing but the hard truth is that the Hallam character never earns the title mister
I saw this film first in the Soviet Union and many erotic scenes were simply edited out by the censorship committee But then in Poland in 2000 I watched it in a complete form And so what The plot is incredibly unwise 2 men survive the genetic catastrophe and find themselves on the planet full of feminist strong straight and fundamentally severe ladies The men now try to fight it and then the whole bunch of extremely silly clichés follow sex drive constant masculine desire for sex feminists who are shown like complete idiots you may agree with them or not but idiots certainly they are not and so on The performance even of the stellar Jerzy Stuhr is here wooden and strangely bad he just pulls unfunny faces and repeats on saying phrases like I am in the elevator with a nude chick and I haven t done anything to her This was intended to be a comedy instead it turned out to be a vapid farce full of predictable jokes and below the waist innuendos Do not waste your time on it this is just bad
Once again I have seen a movie made by people that know nothing I just recently reviewed Baby Face Nelson Now I ve seen Dillinger and I ve had it br br This movie is garbage I don t know how anyone in their right mind could compare this to a classic like Bonnie and Clyde This movie is far from a classic Someone called it brilliant That s an insane thing to say This movie can t get any facts straight and it has the worst casting I ve ever seen I don t know whose dumb idea it was to cast Warren Oates as John Dillinger First of all he looks nothing like him Second of all by the time John Dillinger was killed he was 31 When Oates made this he was 45 You could even tell that he s older than the real Dillinger just by looking at him Not only was he too old but so was Ben Johnson as Melvin Purvis br br They show Baby Face Nelson die then Homer Van Meter and finally John Dillinger John Dillinger was killed before both of them The last one to die out of the three was Baby Face Nelson Not only do the writers not know when they died but they also don t know how they died Baby Face Nelson was not killed after he escaped from Little Bohemia in a robe Homer Van Meter was not killed by farmers with shot guns Homer Van Meter was cornered by the police in St Paul and gunned down with machine guns Another member of Dillinger s gang Harry Pierpont is shown being shot by police in this movie Pierpont wasn t shot Harry Pierpont was captured and sentenced to die in the electric chair I go into what happened to Baby Face Nelson on my Baby Face Nelson review so I m not going to go into it again here Let me also add that Richard Dreyfuss portrayal of Baby Face Nelson is pathetic There s a scene where he attacks Dillinger and then gets a bad beating While Dillinger was beating him he was crying like a baby and screaming Leave me alone Baby Face Nelson and John Dillinger never fought Maybe Dillinger didn t agree with Nelson s bank robbing methods but they never fought Nelson also never cried like a little girl while getting beaten They keep calling him Lester Baby Face Nelson He was never in his life known by that name Nelson s real name was Lester Gillis and he changed his name to George Nelson The black guy that escaped from jail with Dillinger was Herbert Youngblood but in this movie he is known as Reed Youngblood John Milius doesn t know anything Where the hell did John Milius get his information I could probably make a better movie than him br br Finally the way they showed John Dillinger die is outrageous and inexcusable The movie shows Dillinger walk out of the Biograph with the Lady in Red and his girlfriend Billie Frechette By the way Billie Frechette wasn t even there that night But a girl named Polly Hamilton was Melvin Purvis yells Johnny Dillinger pulls out his gun and is blown to hell It is a proved fact that Dillinger did not have a gun that night The FBI gave him no chance to surrender and as soon as he was in sight they blew him away They didn t even have to shoot him They were so close that powder burns were found on his face It was murder They also say that the man killed that night was not John Dillinger After killing tons of civilians in the Little Bohemia incident can you imagine the FBI reporting that they had just killed another innocent unarmed man The gun they had on display that was supposedly on Dillinger was also proved not to have been manufactured until after Dillinger s death I could go on and on how the man they killed wasn t John Dillinger but I ll stop here If you would like to know more check it out here br br See the Dillinger version with Lawrence Tierney if you want but don t waste your time with this inaccurate piece of garbage movie
I just finished reading a book about Dillinger This movie was horribly inaccurate It s like they got a list of names and just made everything up His robberies and getaways were well planned down to the second when the time was up they left whether they had all of the money or not They had notes of every road where to turn etc Purvis never saw him at the restaurant he was told that Dillinger paid for his meal after Dillinger left Purvis never even SAW Dillinger before the night Dillinger was killed only photos of him The way his gang members died were fictitious Dillinger never robbed a bank by himself like he did in this movie If I had never read the book maybe I could have enjoyed the movie The acting was a bit over the top in places The action was overdone as well On second thought I doubt if I would have enjoyed it much even if I HADN T read the book
Proof why Hollywood conventions are in place Stale dialogue underdeveloped and flat characters and a disjointed storyline are only part of the problems with this gangster classic wannabe An attempt to be daring and different but this appears to be a slap together attempt at recreating the magic of Arthur Penn s Bonnie and Clyde 1967 and George Roy Hill s Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid 1969 truly innovative filmmakers and films but falling well below the bar Problems with storylines being self explanatory result in the need for a voiceover to explain problem sections The editing appears again to be an attempt to duplicate the previous classics but is occasionally disjointed and cause more problems for me technically Unnecessary shots are thrown in to justify the filming of them but would have better served the viewer by sitting on the cutting room floor Stills black white montages and period music are thrown in from time to time in attempts to either be different or to cover up for scenes that can t transition well or to replace scenes that just didn t work at all and again are reminiscent of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid 1969 br br Overly dramatic pauses between sentences random shots of surrounding scenery that wasn t needed for storytelling plus over the top acting of bit players and supporting actors was reminiscent of the backyard camcorder directors of the late 1980 s I was left wondering who was in charge of this film during production and during post production The playing of music in most two shots and close ups and then suddenly stopping in wide shots overly emphasized a weak musical score No sound editing was drastically apparent as the bulk of the film was gunshots doors footsteps and dialogue a style used in the late 60 s through the mid 70 s by new directors but lacking background noise causing it to seem artificial particularly the tire squeaks on dirt roads In my honest opinion the biggest problem of all is there are no likeable characters for the audience to route for nor were we lead to see as the protagonists of the story Neither the gangsters nor the lawmen were characters I wanted to see win and neither were focused on as the hero a necessity for any story to work for me We know from Penn s and Hill s movies who the heroes are Even though they are criminals we like them and want to see them get away I could care less who was on the screen in this film I got the impression that John Milius was trying to give off a non historically accurate reenactment documentary of the events surrounding John Dillenger s life from June 1933 to July 1934 his death br br To be fair there are some moments of good solid storytelling which are moments that shine forth brightly from the dark and dismal canister in which this film sits John Milius gets better thankfully in future films where he doesn t seem to try to copy other filmmakers Dillinger 1973 isn t a total waste as many stars and famous faces who were at the cusp of breaking out are involved with this directorial big budget debut but wait for it on a classic movie channel rather than spending money to rent or buy br br

Anyone who visited drive ins in the 1950s 60s and 70s must have seen a film or two by American International Pictures a distributor that resembled 1980s giant Cannon Films Wherever movie goers ventured AIP would be right there to supply the latest en vogue titles in the 50s came horror movies like Voodoo Woman and The Undead in the 60s were Frankie Avalon Annette Funicello beach comedies and biker flicks like The Glory Stompers and into the 70s AIP churned out grindhouse level trash like Cannibal Girls and Sugar Hill br br Dillinger released in 1973 is one of the more highbrow AIP efforts that capture the true spirit of drive in film making it is one of those uneven over the top flicks that satisfied the masses thirst for entertainment craftsmanship and common sense be damned On the whole Dillinger is typical for its era entertaining and worth a couple of hours but certainly not memorable Heavy on action and short on both acting and historical fact Dillinger was a fair effort by screenwriter director John Milius Magnum Force but certainly left room for improvement in his extensive career br br The 109 minute Dillinger epic for AIP s scope follows the quest of FBI Midwest chief Melvin Purvis played by Academy Award winner Ben Johnson Purvis was the investigator who sought revenge for four FBI agents killed in a 1933 Kansas City ambush that helped gangster Frank Nash to escape justice At large were the men who supposedly plotted that breakout including expert bankrobber John Dillinger Warren Oates Pretty Boy Floyd Steve Kanaly and psychopath Baby Face Nelson Richard Dreyfuss Dillinger eventually joined forces with Floyd and Nelson taking along Homer Van Meter Harry Dean Stanton and Harry Pierpont Geoffrey Lewis He also hooked up with Billie Frechette Michelle Phillips a prostitute of French and Indian extraction While taking place over several months in 1933 4 Dillinger is basically a chase film with Purvis s entourage looking to run down and kill off the men wanted by J Edgar Hoover br br Dillinger has a documentary feel listing dates and places while Johnson supplies loose narrative as Purvis Milius keeps an honest Depression look using authentic fashion cars weapons and buildings he also sprinkles around black and white photography and stock footage of gangster shootouts The film is never boring moving at a quick if haphazard pace The action scenes are Dillinger s strongpoint edited competently by Fred Feitshans Jr in his last professional effort Thousands of blank ammunition rounds must have been used to make this film not to mention pounds of explosives This film is certainly not for the squeamish with people getting shot and dropping dead all over the place The violence while gratuitous brings some understanding of the mayhem that organized crime dumped on American life br br This film never transcends its exploitation status however because the needed writing just isn t there John Milius somewhat overrated as a filmmaker places way too much emphasis on action The action scenes mostly blood filled shootouts are impressive and comparable with any major crime film of its era including 1967 s Bonnie and Clyde But we simply don t get to know much about Dillinger and his gang members as people the vital relationship that develops between Dillinger and Frechette is barely touched upon with the pair meeting in a bar during one scene and cavorting as lovers just ten minutes afterward Melvin Purvis also seems to wander in and out of the storyline becoming a prominent figure only when Milius needs to keep the film from unraveling All too often the film takes on a shoot em up persona when its characters could have been explored in detail br br Aside from this the picture s main crime is ignorance of historical fact While many say that Dillinger is just a film it s films such as this one that create fables and make them permanent Those with knowledge of gangster history will point out that John Dillinger was not the last of his ring to die as Milius s screenplay and the film s documentary style encourage us to believe In fact Dillinger died before Baby Face Nelson and Homer Van Meter he also was said not to be carrying a gun on the night of his death nor did he have Billie Frechette in tow While these inaccuracies might make for high drama there is no reason why Milius couldn t have stayed with the facts and written a great story around them br br Warren Oates s performance as Dillinger is quite good although he sometimes looks unconvincing Oates is humorous and nicely portrays how Dillinger became consumed by his larger than life image in the American press however we never really feel the menace he invoked in his lifetime Ben Johnson gives some life to Purvis suave but rather flat Michelle Phillips brings emotion to the Billie Frechette character and it s really too bad that Milius s screenplay didn t flesh out her relationship with Dillinger We never learn what drew her to a cold blooded killer other than the stereotype of an easy going girl who is attracted to men of danger The supporting roles with Kanaly Dreyfuss Stanton Lewis and a briefly appearing Cloris Leachman are acceptable for such talent br br As a piece of 1970s exploitation Dillinger appears doomed to retail bargain bins which is exactly where I picked up MGM s DVD release for 4 99 The film is nicely presented in widescreen a must for drive in flicks with subtitles in French and Spanish Dillinger s theatrical trailer is supplied as a lone extra Largely forgotten except by gangster movie fans and drive in enthusiasts the film doesn t really call for much else in way of supplementary material For fans of the genre it s certainly worth checking out br br out of 4 br br Roving

I recently watched this film at the 30 Th Gothenburg Film Festival and to be honest it was on of the worst films I ve ever had the misfortune to watch Don t get me wrong there are the funny and entertaining bad films e g Manos Hands of fate and then there are the awful bad films This one falls into the latter category The cinematography was unbelievable and not in a good way It felt like the cameraman deliberately kept everything out of focus with the exception of a gratuitous nipple shot the lighting was something between one guy running around with a light bulb and non existing The actors were as bad as soap actors but not as bad as porn actors and gave the impression that every line came as a total surprise to them The only redeeming feature was the look of the masked killer a classic look a la Jason Vorhees from Friday the 13 Th The Plot was extremely poor and the ending even worse I would only recommend this movie to anyone needing an example of how a horror film is not supposed be look like or maybe an insomniac needing sleep
It s interesting to see what the director tried to do with this film But the problem is that it s not very good There was nothing really original in the film and while the plot was well presented the main characters were all a bit to shallow and you didn t bother for any of them br br Rather bland and sometimes downright bad photo leaves a bit to be desired but I guess you can t expect to much from people who are just doing a low budget film for the heck of it It s unfair to review the film and compare it to other high budget films But alas that is what one must do On its own it s not very good And compared to others it s still not very good But it is not without its good points I liked the plot It was built up rather nicely and tied together well at the end Sometimes in the really dark scenes it managed to build up a creepy feeling as well br br However in the end the film fails to impress The characters are pretty much non existent and we don t care for any of them Any of them might die but it s possible to pinpoint the final survivor from very early on
I Love New York is another entry by VH 1 MTV Networks showing the entertaining side of dating a shrill obnoxious woman It must have been an easy decision to take the most wildest Ebonics speaking craziest contestant and her mother and give them a show on this network Many will argue this is a show True it s not as bad as it s previous show Flavor of Love but it s just as bad br br It reminds me of a skit from the 90 s show In Living Color where Keenan Ivory Wayans was imitating the boxer Mike Tyson on The Love Connection dating show and he picked Robin Givens for a date Mike talked of how the date was okay but how the obnoxious mother kept butting in This show reminds me of that br br The men are chosen and given names to degrade themselves and the woman that they are dating more I would think an intelligent man looking to date an intelligent woman would NOT allow her and her mother to give you a name that is so ghetto you ll embarrass yourself every time you appear on TV but these are professional reality actors so why bother br br It escapes me to discover what is so entertaining about all of this The fact that this is as fake as her newly implanted additions 15 Minutes of fame and hundreds of thousands of dollars in ad time for the network Well you can t hate them for trying to make a buck Maybe the wonder is who would want to be with this woman past an hour Or wonder if she and her mother s next show would be on the WWF Any way you slice it it s a train wreck you ve seen countless times before so by now the shock value is down to nil br br No twist or turn will make this a more interesting train wreck or any different from any of the others Appeals to the lowest common denominator and for those calling an end to reality shows this is just another nail in the coffin as to why they should end immediately
The latest Rumor going around is that Vh1 is starting casting calls for I Love New York 3 mid 2008 So does this mean Budah or Tailor made dumped New York or does this mean New York dumped the winner br br I know Flavor of Love is coming up to it s 3rd season so now with a Flavor of Love 3 and a I love New York 3 will there ever be a true winner br br I ve also heard a few rumors that Chance WILL be brought back for the 3rd Season of I Love New York I have also heard rumors that New York will be Specially featured on Flavor of Love 3 br br Hopefully this was not too much of a spoiler for the ending of I Love New York 2 I m just stating the latest rumor

This is the most saccharine romance I ever sat through The perfect film for an idle housewife in kerchief housedress and ostrich trimmed high heeled mules to watch in the afternoon lying on the couch eating bonbons In fact bonbons play a prominent role in the movie br br The only reason I was able to watch to the end is that I finally was able to gaze at Keanu Reeves dreamy face in almost every scene In most of his films he moves too fast to get a good look The only rapid action in this show is Giancarlo Giannini waving his hands with Latin emotionality more Italian than Mexican really br br The dialog is as stiff as wood Unfortunately no bodices are ripped the hero is disgracefully perfect mannered and mild The aristocratic warm blooded old world family cliche is as old as the hills What does it matter if they are Irish or Italian or Mexican This is a fairy story br br I knew before the titles finished running that this would not be the movie I hoped for The glowing grapes looked like the paragon of all food ads in Women s Day Magazine I didn t see his name listed but the art director surely was Thomas Kinkade who paints the million dollar canvases of Irish cottages snuggled in fuchsias This film was literally seen through rose colored glasses If you like dreamy pink and blue sky this film is for you The bonbons looked really good too
It must be the most corniest TV show on the air This is probably a escape for Jim Belushi and all of his bad movies His brother sucked all the talent out he younger brother I hope this show is canceled and never spoken of again except in a negative use Jim has got to retire or something Please let them go of the air If i here a joke from that show i will throw up and and wash my eyes out with a toothbrush Id rather be taken from the devil himself than watch a full half hour that piece of programing I still do not understand why the show is still in the air and running We all know deep down that we want to shoot our TV screens when we see Jim s face In conclusion no more please
I love the episode where Jim becomes the Greenman It is great When Jim tosses that little person through the window the look on his face is priceless Then when he starts to address the Priest in his wife s behalf only to find out that she has become the Pee Woman Great writing and great casting along with great acting makes this a must see I am attempting to find a certain photo from that episode I d like to use it as my avatar on a message board because I think the Greenman is hilarious Does anyone know where I can download a photo of Jim as the Greenman Can anyone point me in the right direction to find such a photo
I always wrote this series off as being a complete stink fest because Jim Belushi was involved in it and heavily But then one day a tragic happenstance occurred After a White Sox game ended I realized that the remote was all the way on the other side of the room somehow Now I could have just gotten up and walked across the room to get the remote or even to the TV to turn the channel But then why not just get up and walk across the country to watch TV in another state Nuts to that I said So I decided to just hang tight on the couch and take whatever Fate had in store for me What Fate had in store was an episode of this show an episode about which I remember very little except that I had once again made a very broad general sweeping blanket judgment based on zero objective or experiential evidence with nothing whatsoever to back my opinions up with and once again I was completely right This show is a total crud pie Belushi has all the comedic delivery of a hairy lighthouse foghorn The women are physically attractive but too Stepford is to elicit any real feeling from the viewer There is absolutely no reason to stop yourself from running down to the local TV station with a can of gasoline and a flamethrower and sending every copy of this mutt howling back to hell br br Except br br Except for the wonderful comic sty lings of Larry Joe Campbell America s Greatest Comic Character Actor This guy plays Belushi s brother in law Andy and he is gold How good is he really Well aside from being funny his job is to make Belushi look good That s like trying to make butt warts look good But Campbell pulls it off with style Someone should invent a Nobel Prize in Comic Buffoonery so he can win it every year Without Larry Joe this show would consist of a slightly vacant looking Courtney Thorne Smith smacking Belushi over the head with a frying pan while he alternately beats his chest and plays with the straw on the floor of his cage 5 stars for Larry Joe Campbell designated Comedic Bacon because he improves the flavor of everything he s in
All the funny things happening in this sitcom is based on the main character Jim being either a bad father a bad husband or generally just enormously selfish How can that be funny Of course a character in a sitcom has to be flawed but Jim s character is flawed in an extremely unsympathetic manner br br And why it that My guess is that it s because he should now better Jim s not a stupid guy he can take care of things and he s got the opportunities to do so But he chooses not to It s a conscious choice he makes when he chooses to not play with his kids not go shopping because he doesn t want to buy lady products and it s a choice he makes when he puts down his relatives br br The other characters seems to only be in the series so Jim can have someone to be a jerk to If the Cheryl character was a real person she would have left him years ago and not stay with the deadbeat for 8 years But alas she s just a catalyst for Jim s quirky middle class extreme selfishness
You need to watch this show once to have seen them all the formula is exactly the same in each episode Jim does something his way he means well but he upsets his wife at the end she finds out that what he did was really for her she caresses his cheek and gives a gummy smile while he looks on bashfully In fact the story lines are so lame and formulaic that I ll take a stab at one now br br Episode Valentines Pay br br Jims wife notices that all of Jims weekly pay has disappeared he then explains to her he lost it at the casino She screams and leaves the house lamenting how awful he is Then on Valentines day he turns up in a limo with tickets to a Ball hence explaining the missing wages She realizes Her mistake and the usual Oh Jim you re so lovely The end br br Another very obvious item is the fact that Jims character is based on Homer Simpson who as a cartoon character can get away with being belligerent and ignorant when this is attempted with Human beings it does not work and Jim just comes over as an arrogant self centered jerk br br IMO the only reason that this is successful is simply because we re so many now in terms of Human beings with TVs these days you could make a show about a man who insulates walls and you d get an audience br br Two and a half men on the other hand is fantastic and hilarious
The show is average It doesn t make me laugh particularly However I think Courtney really brings it down She doesn t look natural She has these three ways to talk all robotic She talks quietly with no intonation she talks normally with no intonation or she does that thing where she starts talking normally and starts yelling gradually However her yelling is like let s pretend I m yelling because I shouldn t be too loud on the set br br She is constantly aware of herself being this cute actress doing this funny thing It s annoying You can t really get her personality because she doesn t really produce emotion and doesn t get upset She has this husband who s doing all these stupid things and there is no reaction from her Very dry and plain acting
I wish I could say that this show was unusual in it s banality but it is usual in every way It has the dumb husband his smarter but boring and conventional wife along with the idiotic sidekick for comic relief it sorely needs it Stale predictable jokes with even more predictable reactions from the laughtrack punctuate this noxious mental narcotic s nauseatingly unimaginative plot lines to leave me either physically ill or in a deep sleep more resembling that of an induced coma But it might be on for a while yet because it gives the average American a personage to which they can truly identify A regular guy just like you and me I live in the southern U S so to me this show is just the opposite of escapism Down here that obnoxious character is everywhere in some form or another Seeing him on television is brutal overkill
This is certainly the worst movie i ever saw The beginning is somewhat good but the end I still don t even get it Magical power 300 years later goddess dancing what the f is that about The acting is somewhat not so bad but some place I could do better for sure
Shown in Australia as Hydrosphere this incredibly bad movie is SO bad that you become hypnotised and have to watch it to the end just to see if it could get any worse and it does The storyline is so predictable it seems written by a high school dramatics class the sets are pathetic but marginally better than the miniatures and the acting is wooden br br The infant muppet seems to have been stolen from the props cupboard of Total Recall There didn t seem to be a single original idea in the whole movie br br I found this movie to be so bad that I laughed most of the way through br br Malcolm McDowell should hang his head in shame He obviously needed the money
This movie is absolutely pointless one of the good esamples how Malcom McDowall never got one decent role after Clockwork Orange This one may be one of the worst though No story crappy special effects shot in 4 3 or even worse cropped on DVD just avoid it
This is probably one of the worst movies ever made Bad acting bad special effects bad plot bad everything In the last 15 minutes a cat suited cyborg is introduced which muddles everything Malcom MacDowell must have needed to make a house payment because otherwise he would have had to sell himself on Hollywood Blvd to pay the bill I just don t know how you can go from Clockwork Orange to this crap and be able to look yourself in the mirror each morning I could have done better special effects in my bathtub There s no continuity The editor must have been asleep or on drugs its so bad Acting Do they have to smoke to be bad The gun either shoots blue flames or bullets make up your mind The bad girl and the other girl in the movie look so much alike that it is confusing Whay is it called 2013 Seadly Wake It has nothing to do with the movie
There are two reasons why I did not give a 1 to this movie One reason are some of the actors like Malcolm McDowell and Gwynyth Walsh work who tried to play at their usually good level of acting However at many scenes they were somehow blocked by the bad scripting br br The other reason is the cool idea and looking of the Cyborg which is quite different to most other such roles I ve seen so far br br Everything else in this movie is as bad as it can be Boring scenes useless and boring dialogs bad script work And it seemed as it was the first movie ever for many actors It could have been an interesting story though but they failed completely
Malcolm McDowell has not had too many good movies lately and this is no different Especially designed for people who like Yellow filters on their movies
If Mr Cranky had rated this I d be tempted just to copy his review and paste it here But as he hasn t I ll have to give it a go myself br br The only thing giving this movie a 1 instead of a 0 is that Malcolm McDowall s acting is excellent However not even he can save this film from disaster The director must have been really distracted when he worked on this one because it is just a conglomeration of scenes that were thrown together with very little continuity reminiscent of bad 70 s movies Even worse both the actors and director appeared to be making it up as they went along which probably showed how bad the original script was br br It s not even worth discussing the story line although it revolves around a futuristic corporation called the Proxate Corporation who put together a crew of dispensable people to carry a dangerous cargo on an old container slave ship to Nigeria This ship s computer is a baby kept in a glass jar and wired into one of the crew via USB 12 or something The company should have been called the Prostate Corporation as the entertainment value of this movie is on a par with an examination of the same name br br I honestly can t find one scene that I could say was well made and made any real sense in the context of the movie I only watched it to the end as I had a touch of the bird flu and this movie reminded me that there were people out there who were actually worse off than me Malcolm McDowall in particular I won t hold this against him as he s a great actor and every great actor is entitled to one bad movie in their career and this one is a doosie br br So unless this is the only movie your shop hires out or you re male and you re doctor isn t doing prostate examinations this week and you somehow feel this is a bad thing then give this one a really wide berth unless of course if you re really community minded buy a copy to support Malcolm and then use it as a drink coaster
Terrible use of scene cuts All continuity is lost either by awful scripting or lethargic direction That villainous robot musta been a jazz dancer Also one of the worst sound tracks I ve ever heard monologues usually drowned out by music And where d they get their props That ship looks like a milk carton I did better special effects on 8mm at the age of 13 br br I d recommend any film student should watch this flick 5 minutes at a time so as to learn how NOT to produce a film Or was it the editors fault br br It s really too bad because the scenario was actually a good concept just poorly executed all the way around Sorry Malcom You should have sent a stunt double You re too good an actor for such a stink bomb
A terrible movie containing a bevy of D list Canadian actors who seem so self conscious about the fact they are on camera that their performances are overly melodramatic and quite forgettable br br This film is badly written badly edited and badly directed It is disjointed incomprehensible and bizarre but not in a good way McDowell does a great job with what he is given but is the only one in this film to do so he really has a bad story and script to work with It s not even camp enough to be funny br br I have yet to see Van Pelleske act in a credible manner and even the sub characters like Eisen with his nasal whiny voice confirm that we are on a lot in Toronto rather than on a barge off Africa br br Didn t the director see that the creature looks like a jazz dancer in an alien suit The fight between the blue bolts of lightning and Pelleske s orange wisps of magic for lack of a better word is obviously the result of bad actors with no choreographer overlaid with completely derivative special effects Was there even a director on set or in the editing room for this disaster film not the good kind br br Learn from the mistakes of others don t even waste your time with this one you ll regret it like I did I have nothing more to say about this waste of celluloid
The Deadly Wake is THE PERFECT MOVIE for film students to learn how NOT to make a film br br Let s see what did the crew mess up in this flick Worst music mix Worst editing Worst script WORST ALL TIME DIRECTING Worst acting Worst choreography Worst cinematography Worst props Worst sets Worst lighting Etc Let s face it if this film had been in ultra high contrast black and white AND silent it still would have been awful All scenes are dark lighting people call it black often the music score drowned out the meandering dialogs which was OK because nobody ever spoke two whole sentences without long pauses for effect The evil robot was hilarious what was that Jazz dancing Oh I guess it was supposed to be walking tactically or something I m sure it struck fear into the hearts of the poor editors And how do you edit so much footage of garbage Not possible Garbage is garbage no matter how you splice it How did anyone ever get this thru the dailys br br Bottom line is I couldn t stand to watch more than 15 minute segments it was so bad but I did see the whole thing with lotsa breaks just to see if it had ANY good parts in it at all NOPE NONE br br A perfect example of how not to make a flick a must see for EVERY serious film student
This is one of those so bad it is good films that you always hear about but never see Unlike Troma films which are deliberately bad and campy and I am not amused this one is 100 pure serious br br However with features such as a supposedly super lethal killer robot that prances about like one of the Solid Gold Dancers on an acid trip and a magical first mate that calls down lightning and transforms into the Good Witch of the East the fact that it takes itself seriously pushes it so far over the edge of bad that makes it full circle around back to entertaining br br Watcheable enough because of that
I find it heart warming and inspiring that the writing team behind such hopelessly mainstream Hollywood movies like INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM American Graffiti and HOWARD THE DUCK would begin their career with a low budget exploitation horror film like this Perhaps as a testament to the talent that would earn Willard Hyuck and Gloria Katz an Oscar nomination later in their respective careers Messiah of Evil has potential but sadly becomes frustrating exactly because it can t muster the film making prowess to pull it off br br The premise involves a young girl who travels to a small coastal town in search for her painter father who went missing a while back It doesn t take long for the fragmented narrative to abandon all hope and dive headlong in disjointed absurdity and for a while it works admirably well to the point where you begin thinking that maybe Messiah of Evil needs to be reclaimed from the schlocky gutter of 70 s exploitation as an example of artful mystery horror br br The surreal non sequiturs keep piling on as the daughter stumbles upon a young couple in a seedy hotel room who are in town to conduct a research on the local legend of the blood moon a scruffy and half mad alcoholic played by the great Elisha Cook Jr in perhaps the best scene of the movie who warns her about her father only to be reportedly found dead in an alley eaten by dogs a little later the blind old lady that owns the local art gallery and who has inexplicably removed all of her father s paintings from the shop and last but not least a retarded murderous squirrel eating albino br br Part of the movie s charm is precisely this brand of bargain basement artsy surrealism that defies logic and genre conventions every step of the way Whereas with Lynch it is obviously the mark of a talented creator with Messiah of Evil the boundaries between the intentional the unintentional and the didn t really expect it to come out this way but it s good enough WRAP SCENE blur hopelessly br br Take for example the double narration that flows in and out of the picture in a drug addled feverish stream of consciousness way one coming from the daughter as she wanders from place to place in search for her father and the other narrated by her father s voice as she reads his diary br br While we re still talking about a living dead picture Messiah of Evil is different and only loosely one at least with current preconceptions of what a zombie movie is supposed to be The origin of the living dead here is a 100 year old curse bestowed upon the town by a mysterious Dark Stranger who came from the woods one day In the meantime Hyuck finds time for snippets of mass consumption criticism in a flesh eating supermarket scene that predates DAWN OF THE DEAD by a good number of years you can hear the MST3K line already man is dead only his capitalist food tins remain and a nicely thought but poorly executed similar scene in a movie theater br br I generally think that the surreal works in careful well measured doses how is the absurd to work if it s not hidden within the perfectly normal Hyuck seems to just smear it all over the picture and by doing so dangerously overplays his hand When the albino for example picks up a girl hitching her way to town and eats a squirrel in front of her you can almost imagine the director winking meaningfully at the audience amused and satisfied with his own hijinks br br The general film making level is also pretty low after the half way mark the pace becomes muddled and the story tiresome and evidently going nowhere and not particularly fast either Add to that the choppy editing average acting and Hyuck s general inability to capture true atmosphere the empty streets of coastal town are criminally misused and I d file Messiah under missed opportunity but still grindhouse afficionados will find enough to appreciate even though it s not particularly gory trashy or sleazy
I just watched this movie in high definition on television I am in a wheelchair due to a neuromuscular disorder and like to watch the few films made about those with physical disabilities br br At first I found the main character somewhat noble and captivating His message about the disabled and the life time he spent fighting to have the disabled recognized and integrated into mainstream society s job market is great And my problem isn t with the real person who did these things HE was a great man But this film is completely hypocritical and diametrically opposed to the very message it is preaching that I found it insulting br br First of all they didn t cast anyone in a title role with an actual physical disability Sure they were competent actors but it seems completely dis genuine to preach about hiring the disabled and then not actually HIRING THE DISABLED for anything in the film Further compounded by the fact that in one scene mid way through the film a man is seen walking to a podium on crutches appearing to have only one leg But the CGI in this scene is so apparent it is shameful What They couldn t find an actual amputee anywhere for the film For a 5 second shot it was more financially sound to do CGI effects than to just HIRE an ACTUAL amputee At that point in the film I found it so fraudulent and completely against the message it was trying to convey that I came here to bitch and whine about it like the pathetic cripple I am br br Figure that out
I was so disappointed in this movie I don t know much about the true story so I was eager to see it play out on film and educate myself about a little slice of history With such a powerful true story and great actors it seemed like a surefire combination Well somewhere the screenplay failed them It was so scattered is this movie about his childhood his love life his own disability his speaking ability his passion for the disabled I m sure there is a way to incorporate all of those things into a good story but this movie wasn t it I was left cold watching characters that were unlikable not because of their disabilities but because of their personalities Other small gripes 1 The heavy handed soundtrack It s the seventies WE GET IT ALREADY 2 If he s such a phenomenal public speaker why weren t we treated to more than a snippet here and there and even then mostly in montages
What about Dahmer s childhood The double hernia operation which is believed to have sparked off his obsession with the inner workings of the human body What about infinity land The game he invented as a child which involved stick men being annihilated when they came too close to one another suggesting that intimacy was the ultimate danger What about the relationship between his parents and the emotional problems of his mother that were far more relevant than just his own relationship with his father His feelings of neglect when his brother was born What about his fascination with insects and animals How he would dissect roadkill and hang it up in the woods behind his home What about focusing more on his cannibalism And what about his parent s divorce These are all things that should have been included in the film Instead the film maker chose to give us a watered down snapshot from a night or two in his life and combine it with series of confusing and at times unnecessary flashbacks to events that weren t even particularly relevant to our understanding of Dahmer br br Why didn t the film maker show how Dahmer was interested in people as objects rather than people He could have made this point many times particularly in the scenes in which he drugs his victims whilst he has sex with them which actually took place in a health club not a night club Instead he just shows him ramming away at them from behind br br Whilst I appreciate there is only so much information you can cram into 90 minutes or however long but why spend such a large part of the film examining his relationship with Luis Pinet known as Rodney in this film My only guess is that the director was trying to build up Pinet s character to try and make us fear for or empathise with him but this film is supposed to be about Jeffrey Dahmer so why couldn t he have spend those forty five minutes on something else If the scene and their relationship was important enough to warrant such time then fair enough but it wasn t The scene in which he kills Steven Hicks his first victim is a vital part of the Jeffrey Dahmer story because it was the first killing and because of the effect that killing had on the rest of his life Unfortunately the film doesn t explain that it was his first killing or that he didn t kill again for nine years We assume because his hair style is different and he is wearing glasses that this is a flashback but to when And why br br What about the shrine he made in his sitting room towards the end of his career one of the most important clues we have towards understanding Dahmer and his motivations br br Some people may find my need for accuracy in fact and detail a bit anal but having studied Jeffrey Dahmer in depth it is plain to see that this film has very little in common with the person he was and the crimes he committed Why bother to spend the time making a film loosely based on Jeffrey Dahmer rather than tackle the real issues behind his descent into madness and the carnage that ensued br br Finally a film with subject matter as repellent as this should carry an 18 certificate not a 15 We needed to see his perversion in more depth to understand just how detached he was from the rest of us That doesn t mean showing the drill actually entering Konerak Sinthasomphone s head for instance but at least an indication of the amount of people he killed and what his Modus Operandi was when actually killing Anyone watching this film who doesn t know the story of Dahmer might come away thinking he had only killed a few people He actually killed seventeen men br br Aside from the facts and lack of depth the film isn t all bad There is some nice cinematography and good performances from the two main characters I d like to see this done again by a film maker who has more knowledge more energy and a better reason for making the film in the first place
Disappointing and undeniably dull true crime movie that has poorly cast character actor Jeremy Renner languidly mumbling his way through the title role of Jeffrey Dahmer who was easily one of the last century s most recognizable degenerates serial killers Released straight to video back in early 2003 Dahmer is an overtly talky boring badly acted and virtually bloodless snore fest of a true crime drama that never truly delves into the monstrous and demented psyche of the late mass murderer like it had the perfectly good potential to do What it does however attempt to do for reasons unknown to me is evoke some sort of sympathy in the viewer for the man by portraying him out to be what is ultimately a lonely nebbishy and severely socially inept homosexual loser who was simply lookin for love in all the wrong places as opposed to the cold calculating and depraved sicko and madman that he was Overall 2003 s Dahmer is one that true crime buffs everywhere might as well skip because I m not kidding when I say that it s one of the worst serial killer biopics ever done It s even sorrier than other pathetic and exploitive straight to video trash like Gacy Bundy Ed Gein and The Night Stalker Turkey Zero Stars
Dahmer is an interesting film although I wouldn t use horror or thriller do describe it It s more a minor character study that seems oddly sympathetic of the killer br br Jeremy Renner portrays serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer who drugged murdered and dismembered his male victims The film centers on the relationship between Dahmer and Rodney well played by Artel Kayàru br br Rodney is almost the more interesting character enamored of Dahmer and having once escaped an attack he returns to Dahmer for sex and survives a second attack br br I think the film is disjointed because it does little to portray Dahmer s formative years how events may have created the human monster we see on screen and offers no insight into Dahmer s belief that he could create sexual zombies of his victims br br The roles are well played but the story is thin
It could have been a morbidly fascinating look at the life of one of America s most notorious serial killers but sadly it doesn t even come close Terrible editing direction bad acting you name it This movie is literally about 10 minutes of plot stretched into 100 The only redeeming quality is Bruce Davidson as the father but that s not nearly enough to save this stinker A 1 out of 10
Curiosity led me to this masterpiece Unfortunately I didn t rent it I bought it The most disturbing thing about this film is that it s not so disturbing For reasons known only to them the makers of this film set out to show the human side of Jeffry Dahmer Are you kidding me The man gave new meaning to the term finger lickin good And with all the flash backs and flash forwards I had trouble following the story All in all Jeremy Renner s performance wasn t too bad You can catch him in S W A T in which he plays a disgruntled ex cop Anyway I would rate this as a 1 10 It only got a 1 because of Renner s so so performance There are plenty of books and tv documentaries out there that do a much better job of covering Dahmer s crimes Avoid this one
Way to go ace You just made a chilling grossly intriguing story of a necrophiliac cannibal into a soft mellow drama Obviously a movie called Dahmer would be one of two kinds Horror or documentary right This was neither It wasn t close to any detailed facts in fact it barely had any substance at all It wasn t really morbid or scary or didn t even try to be very disturbing as if you would ve had to try What the hell was this writer director thinking Here s one of the most REAL examples of sick serial killers ever and we get badly shot poorly acted gay bar roofie rapes and lengthy droning flashbacks to alone time in his old parent s house I think Jacobson was actually trying to present or invent the soft side of j Dahmer
I do have the guts to inform you to please stay away from Dahmer the biographical film based on the real life story of the grotesque serial killer Dahmer strays more in relation to the mentality of its focused subject Jeffrey Dahmer who murdered over 15 young males and ate some of their body parts was probably the most incongruous serial killer of our generation However the real sick individuals are the filmmakers of this awful spectacle who should have had their heads examined before deciding to greenlight this awful dahm project This is not an easy film to digest even though Jeffrey would have easily digested it with some fiery brainsadillas appetizers or even some real life Mr Potato skins Failure
Well it is hard to add comment after reading what is already here but I feel I must say something I wasn t exactly looking for a splatterfest as someone puts it or even blood and guts gore I have some respect for the victims relatives although I really felt the filmaker DIDN T They were nameless faceless and meaningless Just a vessel for Dahmers sexual antics br br I watched this film with the kind of morbid curiosity that makes me think What makes a guy be a serial killer as well as wondering the specifics about the Dahmer story of which I know very little People here seem to think that the movie didn t have to cover the events of the Dahmer story I E his history what happened when he got caught the aftermath etc but IT IS IMPORTANT You see I assume if you are American you WILL KNOW all of this We do not all live in America To tell this story about such a man as he obviously was REQUIRES that at least SOME of the history and actual events are told shown This doesn t mean blood and guts there are ways of showing horrific things in a movie by implication or clever filming without resorting to gore Without even touching upon some of what he did I found out more about him reading the user comments on this site the movie felt like a void A moment in time with very little substance I would like to know if there is a film about the REAL Dahmer because with its lack of direction VERY slow pace that NEVER changes Strange portrayal of homosexuality and the VERY unfortunate lack of ANY attempt at an ending this movie is POOR I would not recommend to anyone that they waste the time it takes to watch it A definite 1 out of 10 for the acting
This movie had so much potential Anyone who followed the story of Jeffrey knows that there are so many details overlooked in this movie it s ridiculous Too much time and effort was spent in the movie on Dahmer s homosexual tendencies and his alcohol consumption Where was the character development The origins of any villain are always interesting and Dahmer was no exception Where in the movie does it address his adolescence when he began killing and mutilating small animals Instead we are giving a dizzying array of flashbacks that seek to explain the origin of the killer but fail to address the major point in Dahmer s development Also the reason why the country became so intrigued with this story was the details how he stored the bodies in his apartment and the lengths and measures he went to to accomplish this his cannibalism and his desire for flesh etc I could go on but to sum up too many lagging points in the film focused on his sexuality and not enough of the gore the good stuff you would expect to see when the title of the movie is Dahmer
Prior to watching Dahmer I thought no movie could be worse than Freddy Got Fingered I was wrong To sum Dahmer up it s a story about a gay serial killer which features almost no killing and almost entirely consists of Dahmer s encounters with gay men before they were killed There is no plot to be found and it serves no purpose as far as telling us anything about Dahmer All you ll learn about Dahmer from watching this movie is that he liked to have sex with men Horrible acting horrible directing horrible writing horrible everything If you have to choose between watching Dahmer and projectile vomiting for three hours go with the vomiting it wll be less painful
I m a big fan of the true crime genre but I couldn t sit through this putrid piece It was almost as if Dahmer was intended as erotica down to the porn flic soundtrack There was no look at what made Dahmer tick no exploration of who his victims were Nothing but Look at how creepy this guy is And I have to give the filmmakers this much their Dahmer is the creepiest thing ever to disgrace the screen
Dahmer a young confused man Dahmer a confusing movie Granted I had a few beers while watching the movie but that doesn t explain why I got so bored by this flick br br Its flashbacks are nothing but confusing and annoying and there s no real storyline with a beginning and an end the only thing that made sense in the movie was the explaining text in the beginning and at the very end of the movie The inbetween stuff which would be the movie is just boring images and a waste of time br br We never see actual murders everything is just a bunch of insinuations Sometimes you even just get a feeling that Dahmer s dreaming the entire thing but you know he isn t since it s br br based on a true story and this actually happened at least most of it But what happened It s not easy to tell br br I do not encourage people to waste time on this movie I br br didn t like it one bit and I felt cheated when it suddenly ended br br
I really felt cheated after seeing this picture It felt like I sat watching this movie 101 minutes for nothing I don t understand what they were thinking when they made this It hardly gets into Jeffrey Dahmer murdering and it has no ending It felt almost like they were leaving this movie open for a sequel It was like watching a television episode of the Sopranos It ends suddenly and you know there s going to be another episode next week It also felt like I just watched part 1 to a two part movie There are many possibilities for what went wrong here they got lazy they ran out of money they didn t know the rest of the story they wanted to make a Dahmer 2 After seeing this movie they all sound very accurate I was watching Jeffrey Dahmer walking through the woods All of a sudden I hear this music playing then writing comes on the screen and says how Dahmer served 2 years of his sentence and was attacked by a fellow inmate and killed at the age of 34 Wow he goes from a walk in the woods to his death in jail How about showing how he got there How about showing Dahmer s trial How about showing some more detail I can t even explain what happened in this movie because it jumped all over the place I actually found myself saying in disbelief That s it that s the end I want to conclude this review by saying there is still a good Dahmer movie yet to be made To the filmmakers I d like to say if you re going to do it do it right
This was a truly bad film The character Cole played by Michael Moriarty was the biggest reason this flopped the actor felt that conjuring up an unbelievably awkward southern drawl would make this character more evil it didn t After about 20 minutes I had wished for a speech therapist to make an appearance this would have added some sincerity br br 1 badly acted 2 unsympathetic characters 3 razor thin plot line br br Yuck br br
The various nudity scenes that other reviewers referred to are poorly done and a body double was obviously used If Ms Pacula was reluctant to do the scenes herself perhaps she should have turned down the role offer br br Otherwise the movie was not any worse than other typical Canadian movies As other reviewers have pointed out Canadian movies are generally poorly written and lack entertainment value which is what most movies watchers are hoping to get Perhaps Canadian movie producers are consciously trying to de commercialize their movies but they have forgotten a very important thing movies by definition are a commercial thing
Saw in on TV late last night Yeah I can hear what y all say about this one It IS likely to be categorized as one of those stereo typical TV soap series In all fairness the story line does have a fine twist to it and you might nod saying Well that s not what I expected But as a film well it is not easy to spot a redeeming element Casting acting camera work cars costume setting script no there s nothing to congratulate Rated R Oh that scene Did we need it This is a film that you can watch it and then forget that you even watched And what was the title again
This is awesomely bad and awesomely embarassing for a Canadian We grow good wine Our writers and poets are among the world s best The National Ballet is rated among the top five companies in the world BUT WE MAKE BLOODY AWFUL MOVIES This one isn t especially bad It s especially typical and typically bad shot in two bit hotels and public parks with thin direction high school level acting and gee whiz lets see what this button on the camera does photography If Michael Moriarity was so intent on doing a Jack Nicholson impersonation couldn t he at least have done a GOOD Jack Nicholson impersonation And if the movie was shot in Vancouver truly one of the loveliest cities on earth and also a centre of yacht building part of the plot why in God s name do we let that endemic Canadian inferiority complex dictate that it be disguised as Seattle Not only am I mad about this film I m embarassed and more than a little ashamed The Australians turn out some splendid stuff We produce pretentious second rate piffle Gawd
Taped this late night movie when I was in grade 11 watched it on fast forward I sugest you do the same I though it would be and action film but went to a cort tv type movie In the end it fits in with the early 70 s social activest type films Glad I missed that era 2 10
Once upon a time there was a science fiction author named H Beam Piper who wrote a classic book named Little Fuzzy which was about a man discovering a race of adorable little fuzzy humanoids on another planet Mr Piper died in 1964 but Hollywood and many of today s authors starting looting his grave before his cadaver got cold This is the book where they got the idea for Ewoks from br br Skullduggery is such a blatant ripoff of Little Fuzzy I can wonder why I m the only who s ever noticed br br But don t take my word for it Here s a link to Project Guntenberg where you can download a copy of Little Fuzzy for free http www gutenberg org ebooks 18137
Skullduggery is a strange strange film based on the novel Ye Shall Know Them by Vercors To unleash criticism at the film feels really unkind since it is a movie that deals with earnest themes like humanity and pleas for upright moral standards and tolerance But in spite of its honourable intentions and its well meaning tone Skullduggery simply isn t a very good film For me the main problem is the terribly disjointed narrative which can t make its mind up how best to convey its message The first half of the movie is like watching a standard jungle expedition flick of the Tarzan ilk later it teeters into sci fi fable by the end it slips into courtroom melodramatics The differences in tone between each section of the movie are too great too jarring to overlook They stick out like a sore thumb and remind you constantly that you re watching a muddled disorganised movie br br An archaeological expedition into the jungles of New Guinea is led by adventurer Douglas Temple Burt Reynolds One of the main archaeologists involved in the excursion is attractive lady scientist Dr Sybil Greame Susan Clark After an arduous trek they stumble upon a tribe of strange ape like creatures These primitive long lost people are covered in hair and have survived for centuries without being in any way touched or influenced by the developments of modern man There is some evidence that they may the ancestors of early man the missing link in the evolution of apes into humans Or perhaps a race of humans who simply look and behave differently from usual Or even a race of animals that have begun to develop human characteristics The archaeologists call the tribe the Tropi and are initially thrilled by the implications of their discovery But things take a devastating turn when nasty opportunist Vancruysen Paul Hubschmid declares his intention to exploit the tribe and their idyll on behalf of developers He questions whether the Tropi are truly human and takes his argument to the courts where he hopes to be granted legal backing so that his own greedy ambitions can be continued br br This was a very early film in Reynolds career and he actually unbalances this movie by acting like he s in a comedy while the rest of the cast take it all very seriously Not that Reynolds can be blamed he has an impossible role asked to play a charming adventurer who really belongs in a Tarzan flick His character and the film are not relevant to each other Clark fares much better as the earnest lady archaeologist and there are nice supporting roles for British actors Edward Fox Alexander Knox and Wilfrid Hyde White A major shortcoming in Skullduggery is the lame and ineffective make up used to give the Tropi their strange hairy appearance Rather than making the actors look like believable hominoids the stuck on hair merely makes them look unintentionally comical and that s just not the right idea We re meant to feel great sympathy for these creatures but that s awfully hard when they look so unconvincing Skullduggery is a failed attempt to tell a story that could have been poignant philosophical and stimulating The honourable intentions are there for all to see but the end result doesn t do them justice A worthy failure it might be but a failure nonetheless
The only reason I elected to give this flick a shot was due to the presence of Oscar winner Ernest Borgnine All I can say is it was the greatest waste of a good actor ever put to film As far as I could tell Borgnine was the ONLY actor in it The other performances were so uniformly terrible I am amazed a studio would actually pay the performers to appear Couple this level of talent in the acting department with a story so plodding and insipid that I thought my eyes were going to start bleeding by the time the credits rolled and you have a perfect cinematic disaster Obviously the movie was made to appeal to an audience of children and to its credit it was better than most of the original programing on the Disney Channel and similar kid focused networks But honestly that is not saying much
honestly where can I begin This was a low budget HORRIBLY acted film it was so cheesy it had us all bursting with laughter to how completely retarded it was the sword fighting scenes weren t even sword fights they were playing around with some plastic swords they bought at wal mart and all they were doing was just moaning to try and make it look like they were struggling Me and my family was in the mood for a really good action movie one day so we decided to go to the store and look for one and there it was The Sawtooth Island movie I mean it looked so great but when we watched it at home I practically died after the first scene br br Oh and the plot of the film the story board the script etc was a bunch of garbage that I don t even know why the director and producer even wasted their time making it But if you happen to stumble upon this movie do not get it
Over several years of looking for half decent films to rent for my kids I ve developed a sixth sense for spotting the really cheesy direct to video efforts that are really painful to sit through for anyone over the age of eight I dropped the ball on this one and the kids spent half the movie asking me what did she say that for and why did he do that and my eyes got sore from rolling them every minute or so as characters did a really bad job of introducing seemingly random plot changes And the next time someone decides that having absolutely no skill with a sword is simply bringing realism to a film please run them through with a dull butter knife Prehysteria was head and shoulders above this Arrgh
You gotta love the cheesy low budget movies This one comes complete with bad effects props and bad acting really bad Plus every time I see Mercedes McNab the sister I keep thinking Watch out She s a vamp for those that know Buffy Angel br br A perfect example of what happens when someone with bad taste and wants to waste money making a flick the little that was spent of course I don t know if I feel more sorry for the writer of the movie or the producer who didn t make back any money br br I d say it s good for little kids in it s simplicity but I don t know if I d want to subject a kid to it br br umm 1 10 because that s the lowest it will go
While the overall idea of Escape from Atlantis was intriguing I found the film to be far less than what I had hoped for upon reading the plot summery Perhaps I am too much of a child in the technological age the movie was made as it is now 2002 an official five years ago after viewing fantasy epics such as Lord of the Rings and science fiction feats like Star Wars as a whole it could not compare to other movies of similar line such as Dinotopia or Homer s The Odyssey br br My beef basically is that I couldn t relate I am just about the same age of the children a young adult and have no trouble putting myself in the place of a middle aged man if that is the character available But the picture did not take me to a different mental plain of existence I didn t find myself saying ACK I would have done the SAME thing It did not open the doors to my imagination Even without comparing it to high budget films or other TV movies standing alone certain aspects of the feature I found to be cliche The character development in the children occurred too rapidly for my liking seeing too much of the stereotypical selfish teenager bitter after divorce image changing into the we re a big happy family let s never separate again feel that can ultimately make or break a picture in the long run Even the characters themselves could have undergone improvement a typical set of one or the other stereotypes There was the ever present selfish beauty looking to be rebellious accompanied by Mr Perfect image of combining athletics good looks and intelligence yet a brooding attitude and lastly the smart aleck little brother we find to be so common these days While I know the personalities pushed the story along I think that adding more individuality as far as nuances and more unique differences would have made it a more enjoyable and believable as far as character movie br br I do have to raise my glass to the costume and set design that made it worth finishing to the end for me Don t get me wrong all movies are worth seeing for yourself and the opinion of one could never account for the opinion of many but I think that with a little more depth to the script and a little more I cannot believe I am saying this realness I dare say Escape from Atlantis could have been magical
I know it s a Power Rangers gimmick and catered to 7 year olds but really why were they taking themselves seriously with this movie If they are going to write a plot with crayons at least have the decency to make it silly It s kind of hilarious if you watch this We have a typical family filled with cliched characters father a war veteran who lost his wife and blames himself LOLOL air head children trying to hard to fill the stereotype but fails with horrendous acting and a laughably horrid sidekick who serves no purpose to the movie but to fill camera space Funny stuff br br However the real great moment comes near the end when war dad and bad acting villain try to work a sword fight but then they realize none of them know how to probably because no room in budget for choreographers so they come up with this American Gladiator type setting to run around in LOL br br 1 10 rating because they try to treat this seriously
This film was on late at night when I saw it It was interesting at start but it didn t convince me as a whole I am no Tyson fan In fact I don t like boxing at all It s barbaric obscene and double faced by society that some get money for beating each other up br br Nevertheless I felt the start of the film was OK Actors alright especially George C Scott as Cus D Amato I don t know how reliable the flick is I haven t read books and books about boxing or Tyson I don t know anything about the man but it was quite entertaining br br As the movie went on I felt it lost a little of it s charm and I also lost interest I managed to stay awake though but the last hour was just not good enough
A very ordinary made for tv product Tyson attempts to be a serious biopic while stretching the moments of angst for effect fast forwarding through the esoterics of the corrupt sport of boxing and muddling the sensationalistic stuff which is the only thing which makes Tyson even remotely interesting A lukewarm watch at best which more likely to appeal to the general public than to boxing fans
TYSON br br Aspect ratio 1 33 1 br br Sound format Stereo br br Reverent though scrupulously fair account of the life and times of champion boxer Mike Tyson Given his conviction on a rape charge the film is careful not to portray him as hero or villain but paints a warts and all portrait of his rise to fame the pressures of success and the people who shaped his destiny for good or bad Constrained by time limits the script gallops through a succession of relevant details alighting briefly on significant events culminating with Tyson s temporary downfall in 1995 Novices will be enlightened by the chronology while boxing fans will be entertained by director Uli Edel s straight arrow approach to the material He portrays Tyson s life as a circus in which he was ultimately led astray by the circumstances of his own success In fact the script reserves most of its venom for Tyson s ex wife Robin Givens characterising her as an ungrateful gold digger who took advantage of his naivety Production values are uniformly solid and the cast is superb Michael Jai White does a fair imitation of the title character George C Scott plays Tyson s mentor Cus D Amato through acres of gritted teeth and Paul Winfield was surely born to play Don King
As far as Spaghetti Westerns go I d put This Man Can t Die on the dull side of the genre It s not that the movie is particularly bad but it lacks the brilliance and flash of some of the other SWs I ve seen Guy Madison does his best in the lead role but lacks the on screen charisma necessary to pull it off With one notable exception the rest of the cast isn t particularly good The direction is uninspired and offers very few moments that I haven t seen before There s just not much to get very excited about br br The cast exception I mentioned is Rosalba Neri She s the one bright spot in this otherwise mediocre film Unfortunately her screen time is limited to less than 15 minutes Note The IMDb page for This Man Can t Die is wrong Rosalba Neri does not play Jenny Benson Instead she is the character Melin I m not sure how anyone could mistake Rosalba Neri for some guy named John Bartha as listed in IMDb s credits for the movie
Second tier American leading man Guy Madison plays a character whose notoriety precedes him in this Spaghetti Western which having very modest credentials emerges as essentially routine though featuring a nice enough score The plot offers some mild interest the title incidentally refers to a wounded man involved in the murderous assault by gun runners on a ranch the property of the family of their pursuer cavalry agent Madison The latter s younger siblings are determined that the injured party now in their charge lead them to the gang boss responsible ultimately the identity of either mystery man proves a surprise and both ironically become involved with one of Madison s sisters another is raped during the raid Euro Cult starlet Rosalba Neri appears unremarkably as a saloon hostess and Madison s ex flame
This is an OK film but lacks any real depth either emotionally or in terms of story telling br br The story is based on real events and this limits the amount of action to virtually none also no real suspense br br Washington is believable in the lead but he is sleep walking through it there is no scope to flex any acting muscles for him or the supporting cast br br The story simply falls a little flat even having never heard of the title character the ending was obvious but unlike other films about such injustices this one has no emotional impact you don t really care about him and the motivations of those on the outside helping seem more academic than concerned for his welfare br br There is an attempt to inject some emotion using the boy outside who hero worships Carter but this seems forced br br It s an OK film but instantly forgettable
Fairly good movie but not a true story br br Rubin Hurricane Carter was a notorius liar a murder and was never found not guilty New Jersey State just didn t go for it a third time as 20 years had gone Carter got an offer in 1976 Pass a lie test and go free He didn t take it This film should never have been made but money talks A lot of people have unjustly spend their lives in prison and undoubtedly more blacks than white Why choose a fake story br br Jens
This movie looks like it was made for TV For years I waited for some movie to be made about Rubin Carter because I loved to see him box at the old MSG and to see this movie was very disappointing I have alot of respect for Mr Washington but he was awful and boring There is really nothing good to say about this movie except I did like the song
Denzel is about the only thing that is right in this movie br br Maybe once in an early stage this was a better movie Someone decided to cut some action and plot points into the beginning of the movie giving away most of the story line in about the first 5 minutes That and ruining whatever build up in pace and rhythm the movie might have had before br br So first it confuses you and then it puts you off The dramatization pushes beyond suspension of disbelieve br br Of course there is that feeling of great injustice and anger that movies like this potentially manage to instill in viewers Granted it does that so if you are looking for that knock yourself out
When I saw this movie I heard all the hype and I heard how people said that Denzel deserved the Oscar alongside his Golden Globe and I believed he must have done an outstanding job considering Kevin Spacey was excellent I was wrong I realize that people say this not to anger the African American community if they are not African Americans themselves I always hear complaints on how African Americans are never nominated and how they should have won Sometimes this is true not as much nowadays because Whoppi Goldberg should have won best actress for The Color Purple and the movie should have won best picture The only reason this movie was so blown up the way it was is because people see a movie about the SEMI SPOILER hardships of an African American during a very racist time period and they automatically label it as a masterpiece br br Denzel Washington is an outstanding actor but his role in this movie did not affect me whatsoever I was bored with him in the movie and his acting here was quite similar to his role in Malcolm X but not as good The audience is supposed to leave believing this man Rubin Carter is a saint People left the movies worshipping this man this hero and they went out and bought his book making this hero of a man rich br br SPOILERS This movie tells the tale of a man who spent the majority of his life in prison mainly for crimes he did not commit Of course the crimes he did commit stealing mostly was only to survive nothing more People felt sorry for him even though the drug dealers and thieves probably amounted to as much for the same reasons but are looked down upon in society Everything in this movie tries to portray this man as a saint except for the obvious infidelity he had towards his wife and the aggression he showed the other man when he met his wife but why wouldn t it after all it is his point of view I do not like movies especially Hollywood interpretations that are based on true stories because they usually distort the true parts into something else something not so true This was his point of view and a Hollywood construction yet everyone believed it was the truth unquestionably Well I researched his past a bit before making any assumptions and he was a very violent man Not only that there is still a possibility that he did murder those people If you do not believe me search for him on the internet and read the articles some people have of him The boxing match he claimed to have won so easily was actually won by his opponent Joey Giardello and there are tapes to prove it Besides that there are many twisted and purposely left out facts in this movie The supporting cast were the nicest people I have ever seen on the face of the Earth and their nice and perfect persona looked difficult to keep up br br This movie was a Hollywood version of yet another unfortunate true story that is still left to be told truthfully Denzel s acting is stale and the supporting cast s Mickey Mouse attitudes are annoying The movie also begins very slow paced and is boring
If this movie was about a fictional character the movie could stand on its own and be judged objectively Unfortunately for the viewer the movie is based on facts that are shaded very unfairly toward Ruben Carter Many of the smaller facts were disregarded Carter was NOT number one contender at the time of the murders there is no proof at all that he saved a friend from a child molester in his youth but some of the larger facts like apparently being robbed of a decision to Joey Giardello because of racist judges is inexcusable to those of us who have seen the fight on tape and completely disrespectful to Giardello Why Hollywood feels the need to make a hero out of someone who at best was in trouble and around trouble much more than any normal person should be was arrested multiple times for beating women is strange to me Ruben Carter was never by viewing his actions in the 60 s and even now when he refuses to speak to his son a person that people can look up to Everyone knows that Jewison can direct and Washington can act but why they chose this story as their vehicle is beyond me Is Hollywood so much in need of a black hero that they need to bend the truth in all of their bio pics to make them believable Heres a suggestion How about Denzel playing a movie about himself Now thats inspirational Based on all of the inaccuracies in the movie I would suggest passing on this one
This movie is another one on my List of Movies Not To Bother With Saw it 40 years ago as an adolescent stayed up late to do so was very annoyed to find that it was about 95 romance 4 everything else 1 history if that It s what I call a bait and switch movie one with an interesting title the actual movie is a scam This is a subject which deserves a good cinematic treatment this movie is almost an insult to those who served The actual members of the Lafayette Escadrille were not on the run from the law nor were they the products of abusive homes they were in reality idealists who wanted to do something to help France And I suspect many of them came from a more upper class background than Tab Hunter s character Flying school is not for the smart alecks and the know it alls an individual such as the one portrayed here wouldn t have lasted two days it would have either been the stockade or the infantry Discipline in the French Army was often rather fierce In short another Hollywierd version of an historical episode that deserves proper treatment
Probably the worst film I ve ever seen the acting and story were terrible and I almost fell asleep The only good actor was Colm Meaney I had the impression to see the same scenes again and again until the end no emotion no charisma nothing
I had high hopes for this film because I thought CLEAN SHAVEN Kerrigan s first feature was absolutely terrific the most assuredly cinematic low budget film I d ever seen br br But much of CLAIRE DOLAN is utterly pointless and flat Scene after scene seems randomly tossed into the mix without much thought for narrative or character br br Is Claire trying to escape being a prostitute or not Hard to tell Why does she pick up the trick at the airport if she wants to escape that life Why does she then not pick up tricks when she needs money in Seattle Why do we have to see her dye her hair to what is virtually the exact same color Why does Claire accept some johns and not others The filmmaker doesn t seem to know br br It feels as if everything is improvised though I understand this wasn t the case and the filmmakers just held a camera on it as if they were making a verite documentary br br After the screening I saw Kerrigan defended his lack of narrative choices by condemning film narrative as politically conservative It sounded like learned rhetoric I think it was a cop out br br I am saddened that the maker of a film as exciting as CLEAN SHAVEN would go on to make such a lame film as this one and then defend it with tired old political cliches
This is exactly the sort of Saturday matinee serial I loved during World War II I was under ten years of age And that s the audience this serial is designed for Looking at it now one must roar at its ineptitude and stupidity The budget must have been next to nothing given the shortcuts and repeats The acting Well this is Republic pictures 1944 They read the lines and no doubt had one take to make them convincing br br One and half stars
Like most people I was intrigued when I heard the concept of this film especially the film makers were then attacked aspect that the case seems to emphasize what with the picture on the cover of the film makers being chased by an angry mob br br Then to watch the film and discover oh what they mean by the film makers were attacked was some kids threw rocks at a sign and a number of people complained loudly and said Someone should beat those two kids up The picture on the cover the chase as it were Total fabrication Which I guess ties in with the theme of the film lying and manipulation to satisfy vain stupid children with more money and time then sense br br I have no idea what great truth the viewer is supposed to take away from this film It s like Michael Moore s Roger Me but if Roger Me was Moore mocking the people of Flint It s completely misdirected and totally inane Wow Can you believe that people who suffered under the yoke of Communism would be really excited to have markets full of food What jerks And it s not so much Look at the effects of capitalism and western media blah blah blah since it wasn t just that their fake market had comparable prices to the competitors it was that as many people in the film say the prices were absurdly low someone mentions that they should ve known it was fake by how much they were charging for duck That s not proving anything except that people who are poor will go to a store that has low prices bravo fellas way to stick it to the people on the bottom br br Way to play a stupid practical joke on elderly people You should be very proud How about for your next movie you make a documentary about Iraq and show how people there will get really excited for a house without bullet holes in the walls and then say HAHA NO SUCH HOUSE EXISTS YOUR SO STUPID AND LOVED TO BE LIED TO BY THE MEDIA br br Morgan Please Like Me Spurlock unleashed this wet fart of a film and it s no surprise since Spurlock as One Hit Wonder prince of the documentary world seems to throw his weight behind any silly sounding concept to stay relevant in a world that really has no need of him br br Avoid like the plague
The main problem with the documentary Czech Dream is that isn t really saying what it thinks it s saying br br In an audacious I hesitate to use the word inspired act of street theater Vit Klusak and Filip Remunda two student filmmakers from the Czech Republic pulled off a major corporate hoax to serve as the basis for their movie they deliberately fabricated a phony hypermarket the Eastern European equivalent of Costco or Wal Mart Super Store built an entire ad campaign around it replete with billboards radio and TV spots an official logo a catchy theme song and photos of fake merchandise and then waited around to see just how many dopes would show up to their creation on opening day They even built a makeshift façade to convince people that the store itself actually existed br br One might well ask Why do such a thing Well that s a very good question but the answer the filmmakers provide isn t all that satisfying a one Essentially we re told that the purpose of the stunt was to show how easily people can be manipulated into believing something even something that s not true simply through the power of advertising And the movie makers run for moral cover by claiming that the real i e higher purpose for the charade is to convince the Czech people not to fall for all the advertisements encouraging them to join the European Union Fair enough especially when one considers that the actual advertisers who agree to go along with the stunt declaim against the unethical nature of lying to customers all the while justifying their collaboration in the deception by claiming it to be a form of research into what does and does not work in advertising In a way by allowing themselves to be caught on camera making these comments these ad men and women are as much dupes of the filmmakers as the poor unsuspecting people who are the primary target of the ruse br br But in many ways the satirical arrow not only does not hit its intended target it ironically zeroes right back around on the very filmmakers who launched it For it is THEY THEMSELVES and NOT the good hearted and naturally trusting people who ultimately come off as the unethical and classless ones here as they proceed to make fools out of perfectly decent people some of them old and handicapped and forced to travel long distances on foot to get to the spot And what is all this supposed to prove anyway That people are greedy because they go to the opening of a new supermarket looking for bargains Or that they re stupid and gullible because they don t suspect that there might not be an actual market even though one has been advertised Such vigilance would require a level of cynicism that would make it virtually impossible to function in the real world br br No I m afraid this smart alecky nasty little stunt only proves what complete and utter jerks the filmmakers are for making some really nice people feel like idiots And indeed many of them when they finally discover the trick that s been played on them react with a graciousness and good humor I m not sure I would be able to muster were I to find myself in their position br br I m not saying that the movie isn t gripping something akin to witnessing a massive traffic accident in action but when the dust has finally settled and all the disappointed customers return red faced and empty handed to their homes we can safely declare that they are not the ones who should be feeling ashamed
Loved the original story had very high expectations for the film especially since Barker was raving about it in interviews finally saw it and what can I say It was a total MESS The directing is all over the place the acting was atrocious the flashy visuals and choreography were just flat empty and completely unnecessary whats up with the generic music video techniques like the fast forward slow mo nonsense It was stylish yes but not needed in this film and cheapened the vibe into some dumb MTV Marilyn Manson Smashing Pumpkins Placebo music video Whilst some of the kills are pretty cool and brutal some are just ridiculously laughable the first kill on the Japanese girl was hilarious and Ted Raimi s death was just stupidly funny It just rushes all over the place with zero tension and suspense totally moving away from the original story and then going back to it in the finale which by that point just feels tacked on to mess it up even more No explanations were given whatsoever I mean I knew what was happening only as i d read the story but for people who hadn t it s even more confusing as at times even i didn t know where it was going and what it was trying to do it was going on an insane tangent the whole time br br God I really wanted to like this film as i m a huge fan of Barker s work and loved the story as it has immense potential for a cracking movie hell I even enjoyed some of Kitamura s movies as fun romps but this film just reeked of amateurism and silliness from start to finish I didn t care about anyone or anything the whole thing was rushed and severely cut down from the actual source turning it into something else entirely Granted it was gory and Vinnie Jones played a superb badass but everything else was all over the place more than disappointing Gutted
I heard and read many praising things about Midnight Meat Train which is based on a short story written by no less than Clive Barker and supposedly the best adaptation of his work since the original Hellraiser that he directed himself but so far I can only express very mixed sentiments about my viewing experience The most appropriate term to summarize the whole film in just word is nauseating The violence is sadistic and extreme which undoubtedly attracts fanatic young horror enthusiasts but it s also indescribably gratuitous and exploitative Normally speaking I m very pro violence but it has to at least serve some kind of purpose The butchering literally depicted in Midnight Meat Train is exclusively meant to shock and to repulse the viewers with weak nerve systems and easily upset stomachs and even that isn t fully effective due to the use of digital computer effects There are more shortcomings some even bigger than the pointless gore but perhaps I should focus on the good elements first The basic concept is definitely promising and multiple sequences like the chase in the freezer room for example are literally oozing with nail biting suspense and macabre atmosphere Unfortunately the pacing is very uneven and the elaboration of the potentially fantastic plot is made unnecessarily convoluted Presumably the processing of a short story into a long feature film scenario is responsible for the pacing irregularities but I honestly feel they could have done more with the denouement as well as with the character played by Vinnie Jones The plot introduces Leon an aspiring photographer in New York whose agent advises to search for the truly menacing face of the city through sinister pictures Leon then becomes obsessed with stalking an introvert and suspiciously behaving butcher who always awaits the midnight train Leon s right as the butcher turns out to be a relentless serial killer who literally crushes his victims with a big hammer but the killer s motivations and behavior suggest there s something far more substantial going on the rails at night Midnight Meat Train takes place in naturally unsettling locations like subway stations at night and animal abattoirs plus the film also benefices of good acting performances and a truckload of downright disturbing images like cadavers on meat hooks and train carriages smeared in blood but director Ryûhei Kitamura Versus Godzilla Final Wars doesn t take full advantage of it all The ending leaves a whole lot questions unanswered and even if Clive Barker meant to have like this I still think we deserved a slightly more clarifying finale Midnight Meat Train is a somewhat intriguing and definitely haunting film but not without defaults It s not intended for easily offended viewers but maybe people looking for plot coherence and clarity should leave it alone as well
I don t know why but i thought i ve seen this movie before Maybe it was the name maybe it was the way poster looked i don t know Anyway it was quite promising in the beginning And even throughout the whole feature there were some bright moments Maybe its because i m not a huge fan of the horrors and i don t watch them a lot but this one actually looked fresh sometimes But the rest of it is not so good Laughable at times The movie is slow paced sometimes you will get so bored you d forget what was the story about Characters are not great either All of them The butcher is OK seems creepy and crazy enough Although i didn t get what were those weird looking things on his chest that whole scene just looked fake and kind of out of the blue and why he was collecting those in jars at home The main lead is plain His character is really hard to believe in and very undeveloped But i guess thats scenarists fault Like why he cried when he was taking pictures of his girlfriend Side cast is bad too But the main thing i hated in this movie was the girl My god when will women in horror movies have any brains Its ridiculous The girl finds out that a maniac took her boyfriends camera tries going to police that fails and then she thinks of the best idea ever Why don t we just go and take it I know where the maniac lives Yup Thats swell And then look for the camera in the bathroom Why not And then walk in the room see a bag that was not there before and just have a look inside Maybe camera is there Not there But loads of interesting stuff Shiny Mmmm To realize that bag means that the butcher came back is too hard for her tiny tiny brain Then of course the never ending falling while running away trick that really made it look bad Then to put the final nail into the character in the end of the movie she walks into the wagon FULL with dead bodies hanging feet up screams Noooo like she just ripped her Gucci bag and walks further into the wagon Jeez Come on No one else thinks its just well stupid Just awful If her character wasn t so bad maybe the movie would get another star or two from me And i would even forgive MMT characters that can take a hit in the head with a steel hammer that dude in the train who the conductor killed butcher vests that can protect from bullets weird and cheap looking monsters in the end i didn t read Clive Barkers novel so i have no idea where those monsters came from the fact that no one cared that hundreds judging on the skeletons in the dungeon disappeared in the city and main character that didn t bleed to death when he got his tongue ripped out he barely noticed it i guess Oh and the predictable ending Damn i knew the ending half way in its just disappointing The only reason i m still giving some credit to the makers is that the movie in general looks better than most of the horrors i ve watched past few months Visual style is nice some shots were really nice and good CGI that made the killings look really brutal although blood didn t look real at all I guess some people will enjoy it some like me will watch it if there is nothing else to watch some will absolutely hate it
OK so I just saw the movie although it appeared last year I thought that it was generally a decent movie except for the storyline which was stupid and horrible First of all we never get to know anything about the creatures why they appeared wtf are they doing in our world and really have they been on Earth before we were or did they just come from space Secondly the role of the butcher to maintain order is just so obviously created Really how large could the underground for a sub station could have been There were only so many of those creatures so I think instead of killing innocent people in vain they could have just planted some tactical bombs or maybe clear the are and a Nuke would have done the job I know it sounds funny and it is but I do not see the killing of people as being NECESSARY Thirdly Leon acts like Superman jumping on the train and fighting Vinnie Jones who was way taller and bigger in stature Then again when he faces the conductor he does nothing and acts as a wimp watching all the abominations I mean OK the conductor had creepy help lol but if Leon was so brave he would have gone all the way I mean he risks his life first then does nothing exactly when he should have He could have died as a hero but lives as a coward this might be the case but not after showing so much braveness earlier on Then the cop thing come on This was a city having a subway I bet there must have been other cops except that lady other police stations this was really kind of silly All in all great acting by Vinnie Jones interesting idea up to the reason behind it which is not really built at all By the way what did the signs on the chest mean Vinnie Jones cannot make up for the rest
I am not one of those people who just go online after I see a movie and decide to call it the worst movie ever made If you doubt me please look at my other reviews However for the first time ever I have seen a movie so horrible that I wanted to write about how bad it was before it was even over br br I LOVE bad movies To me Ed Wood is a genius I thought Bloody Murder Jeepers Creepers and most horrible horror movies were good However there is not a single good thing I can say about this film br br The plot is basically non existent If someone reading my review wastes their money to see it they can discern for themselves what the plot might be but I advise you that a nickel would be worth more than watching this movie br br The special effects are bad br br The acting is bad br br The two leads are attractive but that s all there is br br I am not the type to spoil a movie for anyone but I INVITE anyone to email me at foxbarking yahoo com to ask for my opinion on this movie before they waste a dime on it I will tell you anything br br I love bad movies and I love horror and I love new inventive movies I even love horror porn stuff like Hostel Which some reviewers claimed this was like but obviously they only thought so cause Roger Bart was in this and Hostel 2 But this may be the Number 1 most worthless and stupid and dumbass movie EVER made br br And before you disregard this review this is coming from someone who not only sat through the ENTIRE premiere of House of the Dead but actually bought a copy of it
IT was no sense and it was so awful i think Hollywood have a lot of film like that you don t have do watch it people cutter or eater what should i say it made me sick oh my god film is about people that we don t know but feed themselves with Humans they have teeths bla bla bla isn t that familiar i can bet on it you saw it in a another movie the cast was so great but i think scenario was really awful and i should say that Bradley Cooper was totally awesome he s so talented actually i said awful but i think it because of horrible scenes let me explain it did you ever eat tongue but in the film one person did it it was really awful anyway i think film would so good without that awful human eater or cutter scenes
I have heard a lot about this film with people writing me telling me I should see it as I am a fan of extremely bloody gory movies I got my hands on it almost right away but one thing or another always kept me from watching it until now I would have been better off not remembering I even had it br br This movie was atrocious The worst thing though is that it could have been so much better than it actually was I know it was a story by Clive Barker and all and no I have not read that story but it appears to me that if you haven t then you will be as I was completely clueless and utterly disappointed br br The film begins good enough the actors are convincing the story interesting The first scene is bloody a great way to catch your attention I thought the blood looked a bit bad but seeing as it was the very first scene I did hope for improvement later on I was wrong br br The blood and effects are so horrible it was almost an insult to my intelligence to be expected to believe that for instance someone could knock a person s head right off their shoulders using only a meat hammer WTF CGI blood did they even use ANY real blood at all My home made stuff looks better than any used in this film unbelievable acts of dismemberment eyeballs popping out just from getting hit in the back of the head arms cut neatly off does no one remember there are BONES all throughout our bodies too dark scenes every scene is either an odd yellow color or in hidden in shadows it just gets worse and worse I found myself pointing out mistake after mistake There s just too much Add that to the fact that what could have and should have been a great serial killer movie turns into some demonic supernatural monster movie at the end no thank you It should have been kept as a creepy guy butchering people in the subway OK with a conspiracy theory thrown in and an overzealous photographer Maybe they murder people and sell the meat via the meat plant Plausible doable and a lot better I think than the real story That could have and should have worked Instead it became a creatures living at the end of the old tunnel and everyone knows about it but you and unless you read the book well you just won t ever understand it fiasco Tragic what an awful thing to do to a movie with such potential If you like mindless fake blood and gore you ll love this But if you have half a brain in your head then you will completely hate it Stay away far far away
This was a terrible film There was no story line whatsoever To top it all off when they couldn t explain the blood and gore the only good part they threw in a few aliens I hate when directors or whatever run out of ideas and then blame the aliens Watch this film if you like But don t say I didn t warn you Two things How could Vinny say welcome when he didn t have a tongue Its a pity Mr Jones didn t have a bigger role Second thing that bugged me why were we shown Vinny Jones boils and him cutting them off and putting them into blue liquid then these have no further role Why not I don t like to be shown something and that has nothing to do with the story line whatsoever In short Bad story I wouldn t waste my time wish I d have watched Mirrors instead
Where to start The film started out pretty well but after the 30 min mark i caught myself watching the clock The horror at the start of the film was good but then the story kicked in It just got stupider and stupider as time ticked by br br The actors gave an average performance in this movie however i got a bit bored of Vinny Jones constant scowling in the film br br As the film dragged on and take my word for it it dragged on it just got more and more far fetched br br SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT Just when i thought the film could not get any worse towards the end loads if skeleton looking monsters turned up just to eat the dead people which made no sense at all It turned out to be some sort of flesh eating cult and the good guys die at the end The ending in fact just made me laugh at how bad it was Once the lead role disposes of Vinny Jones he becomes the new killer br br In closing this film made Creep look like the best horror film ever made I gave it 1 star because the female lead did a pretty good job but even she could not save this train wreck of a movie
I am really surprised that this movie get a ranking like this I haven t seen such a bad movie for years Omg this was a really bad movie Splatter is not enough to describe the unnecessary nearly funny blood scenes If you didn t like hostel2 or Wolf Creek or Halloween 2007 well this is 10 time worse The story remind me RL Stine goosebumps br br I can t tell about the acting since the script was so terrible Cliché all the time why i must write 10lines i never understood this br br Here comes spoilers br br The story is about a butcher killing people all the time in metro We are talking about thousands of killings and no one gets notice Actually those people are just missing And There is the good guy that tries to solve the mystery well there is no mystery for us because we know from the beginning the bad guy and as usual no one believes him what a surprise In the end he puts butcher clothes and fights to death with the killer butcher
I would just like it to be known that I do not often rate movies below a 5 I was originally very excited to see this movie Its numerous trailer bumps on TV for several months made me REAALLY want to see this movie So the other night when I saw that it was available on FearNet on Demand I got some popcorn and sat down to watch the film br br The storyline seemed intriguing enough some dude is butchering unsuspecting people on the subway There s a photographer obsessed with the missing people Where are they going What s happening to them One day the photographer sees a connection between some photos he has taken and becomes obsessed with the butcher following him around yada yada The film had a way of sucking you in even though the plot was highly predictable Oh no it s dark look out behind you I say quite bored with the cheap thrills br br The plot even though predictable was intriguing that is until the end This was good until the end Then it just got silly says Jack_skellington_freke on the message boards And I fully agree And here come the spoilers br br See I was hoping it was some mad killer some psychotic person obsessed with cannibalism No It was some secret society keeping creatures alive for centuries Woo How original How unrealistic How dull br br 3 10 Come on Lionsgate You ve had amazing films but this one sunk
Do not bother to waste your money on this movie Do not even go into your car and think that you might see this movie if any others do not appeal to you If you must see a movie this weekend go see Batman again br br The script was horrible Perfectly written from the random horror movie format Given a place in confined spaces a madman with various weapons a curious man who manages to uncover all of the clues that honest police officers cannot put together and an innocent and overly curious yet beautiful and strong woman with whom many in the audience would love to be able to call their girlfriend Mix together add much poorly executed gore and what the hell let s put some freaks in there for a little spin to the plot br br The acting was horrible and the characters unbelievable Borat was more believable than this br br Spoiler and can someone please tell me how a butcher s vest can make a bullet ricochet from the person after being shot without even making the person who was shot flinch I m in the army We need that kind of stuff for ourselves br br 1 out of 10 and I would place it in the decimals of that rounded up to give it the lowest possible score I can
Wow how bad can it get This was seriously bad Not in terms of the gore which was mainly laughable CGI but in acting atmosphere and direction br br The story was dreadful the character arc of the main lead was a total joke Within a few nights of stalking Vinnie Jones he starts to become haunted to the point of crying when photographing his girlfriend Um are all New York photographers this childish suggestible and weak His character development had absolutely no justification or point whatsoever and by the very end you ll be laughing out loud at the utterly predictable and totally absurd twist his character takes br br The gory moments were clearly just a weak low self esteemed effort to jump onto the modern MTV style gore wagon all cgi blood yet no real emotion whatsoever These parts were unintentionally funny and distracting by their self consciousness wacky camera angles etc br br Overall this film commits the crime of blowing another potential idea What could have had atmosphere until the stupid monsters at the end is ruined in favour of look at me style self conscious directing This film wasn t made for and audience it was made for a CV a deeply selfish motive
I often feel like Scrooge slamming movies that others are raving about or I write the review to balance unwarranted raves I found this movie almost unwatchable and unusual for me was fast forwarding not only through dull clichéd dialog but even dull clichéd musical numbers Whatever originality exists in this film unusual domestic setting for a musical lots of fantasy some animation is more than offset by a script that has not an ounce of wit or thought provoking plot development Individually June Haver and Dan Dailey appear to be nice people but can t carry a movie as a team Neither is really charismatic or has much sex appeal They re both bland I like Billy Gray but his character is pretty one note The best part of the film to me are June Haver s beautiful costumes and great body
I was never so bored in my life Hours of pretentious self obsessed heroin addicted basket cases lounging around whining about their problems It s like watching lizards molt Even the sex scenes will induce a serious case of narcolepsy If you have insomnia rent this
One previous reviewer called this film pure visual joy I am wondering if s he saw the same film that I did High Art had to have the most relentlessly depressing interiors since Seven One can almost forgive Sheedy and Mitchell for the cliché of going to a B B for their First Time Of course before they do that one has to watch opium den parties inhabited by people who are not apparently gainfully employed but can somehow support a flourishing drug habit Not to mention the icy stares from those familiar movie types the Girlfriend Boyfriend At Start who are well aware they re going to be thrown over sometime in the next 100 minutes or so The movie also states that the Sheedy character has retired from professional photography for ten years now What did she do retire at age twenty
This woman who works as an intern for a photographer goes home and takes a bath where she discovers this hole in the ceiling So she goes to find out that her neighbor above her is a photographer This movie could have had a great plot but then the plot drains of any hope The problem I had with this movie is that every ten seconds someone is snorting heroin If they took out the scenes where someone snorts heroin then this would be a pretty good movie Every time I thought that a scene was going somewhere someone inhaled the white powder It was really lame to have that much drug use in one movie It pulled attention from the main plot and a great story about a photographer The lesbian stuff didn t bother me I was looking for a movie about art I found a movie about drug use
Spooks is enjoyable trash featuring some well directed sequences ridiculous plots and dialogue and some third rate acting br br Many have described this is a UK version of 24 and one can see the similarities br br The American version shares the weak silly plots but the execution is so much slicker sexier and I suspect expensive br br Some people describe weak comedy as gentle comedy br br This is gentle spy story hour the exact opposite of anything created by John Le Carre br br Give me Smiley any day
This was a popular movie probably because of the humor in it the fast moving story an underdog character who shuts up all the loudmouths etc Funny thing is you probably couldn t make a movie with this title if you substituted anybody but white as anything else would be deemed racist by the PC police br br Nonetheless Woody Harrleson as the white guy who turns out to be as good if not better than any of the black basketball players is interesting as is his main counterpart Wesley Snipes br br Snipes had a lot of funny put down lines providing much of the humor The bad part of the film which doesn t bother a lot of people is the extreme profanity in here and the sleaziness of all the characters That includes Woody s girlfriend played by Rosie Perez There are no really clean nice people in this movie For that reason I can t honestly recommend the film at least not to friends or those who are offended by a lotof profanity
Woody Harrelson and Wesley Snipes team up as hustlers on the basketball court Okay that sounds all right there It leaves lots of room for good comedy and a good story But no such event took place in the many following boring minutes of this pathetic attempt of a film This movie became redundant retarded and ridiculous after the first twenty seconds had gone by Woody Harrelson played one of my favorite t v characters Woody from Cheers and I was looking forward to seeing him in this movie But after seeing his acting performance I have come to the conclusion that he should stay playing dumb country hicks who bartend His acting was as dull and poor as the movie Another actor in this unreal film was Rosie Perez I have liked movies with Perez before but I have decided that the reason I have enjoyed other works in her career was that she was not a main character and didn t have that many speaking lines Do the Right Thing But now in White Men Can t Jump she was made a central character with many lines thus meaning that the audience has to put up with her incredibly annoying and whining voice So after seeing this film term used loosely and hearing Rosie Perez for much more than appreciated I can now say that I m a white man and I m getting ready to jump off a twenty story apartment building
You know a movie is bad when the highlight of it is being able to see a brief moment of Jeopardy br br The saddest thing about White Men Can t Jump is that it had tremendous potential For several years I lived in area quite like that portrayed in this film racial tensions were high and basketball meant everything to everyone A film about the members of this basketball culture could have been very interesting but the mediocre acting and poor script in White Men Can t Job left something to be desired br br The movie s sequence of events is cyclical First Billy either wins or loses money by playing a game of basketball He then returns to his home and lounges around with his girlfriend and the process is repeated Most stories build up to a climax of some kind but the climax I saw was just another sequence in this repetition this case being Billy either wins or loses money by playing a game of basketball br br In order for a plot to develop some dilemma must be resolved and this dilemma must be interesting if the film is going to be interesting as well Apparently the writers of White Men Can t Jump forgot this rule as the plot can be summarized as Billy needs to pay the bills I appreciated the change of pace from other formulaic sports movies but I m sorry this was just plain awful I could have cared less if Billy got the money to pay the rent for his apartment br br Despite all this White Men Can t Jump is a successful film Apparently some adamant sports fans will dismiss terrible writing for a few scenes with a basketball in them Others I m sure were lured by the big names playing the leading roles This leaves me to wonder if the cast was replaced entirely with previously unknown actors and the basketball theme was replaced with lacrosse would anyone have bothered watching this movie I really don t think so br br I ll give this movie two stars out of ten the extra star is for the Jeopardy scene which kept me awake for a few minutes Thanks Trebek
I really can t understand how could someone give this disgusting film more than 1 star How can you like such a retarded film where all the animal abuse scenes are real I don t even want to imagine the excruciating pain those innocent and defenseless living beings felt in those horrific moments Jesus What kind of human would torture them like that for no reason or just for money I tell you that director is either mentally retarded or he s just a monster with a heart of stone Or both He truly deserves to get his hands cut off and burn alive br br It contains various horribly barbaric scenes that may cause shock especially to sensitive persons and children a real frog is skinned alive fish are sadistically mutilated and thrown back into the water a dog is beaten birds are thrown into the water br br This movie is more than awful it has to be the worst and most retarded film ever made along with another one called Cannibal Holocaust or something like that I ll never watch or buy any film directed by this heartless monster No one should waste their time watching it especially when there are a lot of TRULY great movies out there in which all the animal abuse scenes are staged br br Fortunately only a few people liked this which is natural since it s the worst film ever so it wasn t successful I hope this will make the retarded director realize that such unjustified barbaric acts of extreme cruelty and violence to REAL animals will NEVER be praised and that he will stage all the animal abuse scenes in his following films I truly believe that everyone receives but what they give There will be a day when all the retarded and cruel humans will feel the same pain they once inflicted to others br br This however is probably my only negative review I usually don t comment on a movie if I dislike it but this time I just couldn t shut up I had to speak the truth because animal abuse must stop
I ll say this much This director is all about RAW images things most of us are not ready to confront head on Images of sex suicide murder and people relieving themselves are constantly bombarding the viewer which makes me wonder if the director was trying to communicate the concept of relief or release Although I don t think that I could ever see this movie again I will say that the director does have a good eye There were some really nice shots and picture moments in the film the fans the wire fish in their hair but the story left me needing more strictly in the since that we were left asking ourselves what the heck did we just see br br Note If you have a tendency to gag or vomit easily don t see this film
Is this the same Kim Ki Duk who directed the poignant life spanning testimonial of Spring Summer Fall Winter and Spring The same Kim Ki Duk who directed the exquisite nearly silent heartbreaking longing of 3 Iron The same Kim Ki Duk who dazzled us with the staggering tragedy of The Coast Guard and made us squirm about the ugliness of nonchalant teenage prostitution before returning to his almost patented nature motif to allow us all characters and viewers alike to experience redemption in Samaritan Girl I just cannot seem to find him in this film br br Oh sure Kim s nature motif is still present The film takes place entirely on a lake surrounded by mountains and on fishing floats resting placidly on the surface of calm waters Yes it s Kim Ki Duk all right Kim even describes the film as beautiful in an interview included in the DVD s special features But I m not sure anymore what that means after viewing this putrescent presentation br br What is beautiful about angry potty mouthed prostitutes lustful violent and potty mouthed fishermen a covetous mute merchant explicit animal torture sequences of self mutilation and a pace that swings nauseatingly between bestial carnality and mindless brutality These are the only elements of humanity that present themselves in this utterly confounding and ultimately pointless film If it is based on a fable or intended as a parable or is meant to be symbolic of something greater this reviewer is unfamiliar with the source material It has been favorably compared to Audition by Japanese director Takashi Miike much to Kim s satisfaction but aside from some astonishingly good performances especially given what they had to work with by lead actors Seo Jung and Kim Yoo Suk I find little reason to recommend this film I have not seen Audition but I doubt it would alter in any way my view of The Isle Its violence is pornographic and senselessly sadistic Its sex is not pornographic but passionless and masochistic Characters behave on irritating impulse because there is no plot Its point is either non existent or I will admit lost amidst Korean cultural quirks that I fail to understand br br The only beauty is in the cinematography which is classic Kim fog shrouded boats lapping slowly across a serene lake mountainous terrain dominating the background and an imaginative and playful use of color At times it seems as if viewers are locked in a big Kim Ki Duk romper room Some touches like the mysterious and seductive mute merchant played by Jung and the pleasantly odd use of motorbikes are intriguing But as a film this effort is downright confusing and in the end offensive to the senses not necessarily to sensibilities One hopes that Kim will leave this kind of film making in the trash heap of his past for we know he is capable of so much more
I generally don t give worry much about violence in films or a vast amount of philosophy symbolism or psychology All this is very well with me and the film brings a lot of the above to us There is beautiful pictures especially of the lake and the nature a good setting of characters a good direction This film could be voted for as a good film However it is spoiled for two reasons and both of these reasons in relation make this film simply disgusting br br First of all there is violence used against living creatures to make this film Not movie violence I am talking about REAL violence This violence alone maybe could be justified if not and thats reason number two the message of the film was not mere introspection about the directors twisted relation towards women Not that we all don t have some real twists with women respectively men But the conclusion of the film ruins it all br br spoiler Our heroine finally dies by here own hand if I remember correctly I saw this film years ago and it enraged me now the guy is out with a new film witch I am certainly not going to watch and is now even more clearly depicted as some kind of natural demon nature growing over her in particular her sex Of course it is the director who kills the women heroine Women have to die especially if men are attracted by their sexuality That seems to be the final conclusion end spoiler br br Well well all that possibly would be fine with me if the director would have kept his view to himself But to use big pictures artsy directions cruelty to living creatures just to say men can be frightened of women and men are cruel to women Thats just not enough I knew when I saw this film it would achieve good critics for the philosophical eastern and artistic and whatever approach But to me this film is just totally marred
Hey look deal with it there are much better portrayals of the hardship of black America than this Although I think this story is weak my criticism is focused on the poor execution of the story which I have mentioned blows br br This was made in the mid 80 s and is horrible in the music score department It s funny to see Oprah as a latter day crack whore type br br The scene where Bigger stuffs Elizabeth McGovern into the incinerator Pure classic cinema First off I don t care how drunk you are you will react to 1200F degree flame no matter how bad your acting But they really milked that scene it was comical I ll tell you what though I had great satisfaction in seeing Elizabeth McGovern burn in a faux death she annoys me
Of all the movies I ve seen this one rates almost at the bottom Haunted Mansion Nothing but Trouble and a few others keep it from reaching rock bottom It is hasty the story is shaky and the events depicted are poorly acted Of course we have to lay some of this at the book writer s door The book the movie was filmed after is outrageously ponderous and illogical Oprah gives a palatable appearance as Bigger s mom but is not nearly at her potential Other famous performers also seem to be at their worst The plot which centers around an African American who decided to take a job as a chauffeur In driving the family daughter to a communist dinner he becomes acquainted One thing leads to another and the girl gets drunk Now the family he s working for are not against blacks but he thinks they are So when he comes home he puts her to bed but she begins caterwauling The blind mother yes hears this so Bigger tries to silence her but instead smothers her Now fearing he s really in trouble for killing a white girl he does what any logical thinking man would do he shoves her into the coal furnace So investigators are carrying out a missing person case and lo they check the furnace the idiot didn t have the foresight to get rid of the ashes He is then arrested and the last hour or so are obnoxious segments from the courtroom If your desperate for a bad movie this one could do the job but if you seriously want to learn about culture issues in th 40 s and 50 s or see a good drama there are a lot better options Avoid this
I m not sure what Diane Silver was thinking when she was making this movie but it obviously had nothing to do with Richard Wright s novel which the movie is based on br br We read the novel this past summer for AP English 12 and just watched the film During periodic note taking and checking of the clock I contemplated the chances of being struck by lightning Of course the sky was completely clear and I was forced to watch the rest of the movie and then write a 5 paragraph essay on it br br Wright s novel discussed very real themes of the mind of a killer and the psychology behind it Silver s movie turned a murderer into a victim which is NOT what Wright wanted see How Bigger was Born 454 br br I m going to make this short and sweet if you want to leave your consciousness in Raphael Lambert s words unsullied skip the movie and read the book The 1986 adaptation is not thought provoking material br br sigh Now I have to write the essay
As good an advert for republicanism as you re ever likely to see Mayerling is an everyday story of royal folk in late nineteenth century Austria Set during one of Europe s seemingly incessant internal turmoils it concerns itself with the Emperor Franz Joseph Mr James Mason his rebellious son the Crown Prince Rudolf Mr Omar Sharif the Empress Miss Ava Gardner and various mistresses secret policemen spies extravagantly uniformed popinjays gypsies dancers wives soldiers swans horses and the bizarre inbred web of European royalty at the time of Franz Joseph s Austro Hungarian Empire Filmed in what the old movie posters used to call A Riot of Color it resembles nothing more than an expensively dressed but intellectually challenged production of The Student Prince Mr James Mason wearing a very natty little white number utilises his all purpose mittel European accent whenever he remembers I am a great admirer of his and I sincerely hope the remuneration was comensurate with the distaste he clearly felt for the character he was playing Mr Omar Sharif who built a career largely founded on looking directly at the camera with his big brown eyes and looking soulful gives a stupefyingly monotonous performance as his son the Crown Prince He is utterly unconvincing as a man who in the movie at least cut a swathe through the distaff side of the Austrian aristocracy With his well buttered locks firmly in place he preens and poses in ever more unlikely uniforms As a rebel he talks the talk but conspicuously fails to walk the walk leaving a bottom button undone on one of his tunics is about as far as his defiance goes Unhappily married he falls in love with a commoner Forbidden Love is one of the movie s come ons As she is played by the most uncommon Miss Catherine Deneuve he is scarcely pushing the envelope there Miss Deneuve has a profile to die for and we see rather a lot of it particularly in the sequence set at the ballet Now I love ballet as much as the next man but this sequence does seem to go on for an excessive amount of time a more cynical critic might consider it to be padding Rudolf s mother the Empress is played by Miss Ava Gardner She gives the part some good old American oooomph making her a bit like Auntie Mame but it s done with undeniable style Rudolf is certainly very fond of his mother I ll put it no more strongly than that The only performance worth watching is that of Mr James Robertson Justice as Sir Lancelot Spratt sorry Edward Prince of Wales He is so wonderfully unconcerned about everything going on around him it s a joy to behold I waited vainly for him to ask Rudolf the immortal question What s the bleeding time I am not qualified to dispute Mayerling s historical accuracy but in my opinion everything else about it is risible It is a Ruritanian Opera Buffa without the tunes to send you home from the theatre whistling
Watch the 1936 version As personally annoying I find Charles Boyer s voice he s more of a match to pay cosmopolitan depressed Rudolf I mean Omar Sharif tries but no too cute and vibrant Catherine Denueve sp besides being too old looks nothing like Marie nothing She looks too sophisticated to even think of dying for love of this man in such a fashion br br The only actor in the entire movie who conveys the role they re playing is Ava Gardner whose appearance as Empress Elisabeth on the screen is fittingly brief and look up pictures of the empress there s more than a passing resemblance as historically Empress Elisabeth wasn t involved that much in Rudolf s life
Despite having known people who are either great fans of Noam Chomsky or think he s a tired relic from the 1960s I really had no opinion of the man save that I knew he gained fame as a linguist although I could not elucidate any of his theories and that he was a liberal socialist with Marxist leanings So stumbling across the DVD of the 2003 documentary Noam Chomsky Rebel Without A Pause in a used video store a film which followed him on a 2002 book tour for his book 9 11 I decided to get it just so I could have a little bit of knowledge about the man the next time a person pro or con spoke of him While glad I got the film my initial reaction to this dull and ill edited hagiography was so what s all the fuss about br br For a man with so many degrees lauded as the most important intellectual alive by the New York Times according to the DVD s case there sure was not a lot there intellectually speaking I know I would chew him up and spit him out in a debate and I wouldn t even want to watch what a William F Buckley could do to him Granted the whole film was seemingly about Chomsky seeing conspiracies everywhere and having glazed eyed coeds nod in bewildering approval of the most inane and outrageous things he d say rather than being on linguistics so maybe that s the reason he came off so badly But again if he is a linguist and tops in his field why in the world would anyone care what he has to say on anything outside his field of expertise Even worse are his acolytes who seem to further insulate the man from reality by fostering delusions that Chomsky is a target for Zionist assassins What little I knew of Chomsky before watching this film this much I knew he was generally considered a has been and pretty much irrelevant intellectually since the fall of the Soviet Empire The film is so poorly structured and without a narrative thread that it s difficult to separate all of the jumble His wife Carol as example apparently gave one interview which was chopped up and dropped wherever in the film She seems a nice enough woman but wholly out of her element answering anything but the most basic questions about their life The lone interesting thing she says is that 9 11 was a great thing for the Chomskys for he has reaped a great deal of money in speaking fees since then br br Not surprisingly this sort of film gives almost no biographical background It s assumed that all viewers must know all the plaudits this great man bears Chomsky is rarely interviewed one on one Stylistically there are no camera movements no interesting edits nor any signature touches and most of the film is disjunct rambles by Chomsky videotaped huzzahs of Chomsky declaiming on this or that and slack jawed and awed students looking at him as if he were immaterial that is when dimwitted coeds are not asking barely audible and ridiculously simplistic questions to him This is really poor film making by director and editor Will Pascoe who in the DVD s Filmmaker Statement shows he s yet another uncritical acolyte of Chomsky s Other than that one of the surest signs that this is not an objective documentary but mere agitprop and a vanity piece of agitprop at that is that not a single time is Chomsky shown struggling with an answer He seems to be a font of knowledge that has no bounds br br Given that much of this dreck was filmed during Chomsky s lectures at McMaster University in Ontario Canada prior to the American invasion of Iraq in 2003 much of what Chomsky says seems as remote as things from the Vietnam War era Yes he makes some good points here and there on American media complicity before the war but he follows them up with sheer lunacy for he seems to not realize that most conspiracies are ad hoc and not fully plotted out cabals As example he claims that the advertising industry is a cabal that mercilessly controls the populace but says not a word about the zombied populace that lets itself be so controlled Similarly he claims Trilateralists run the world and that people s fear of crime is yet another cabal s result Of course that claim so fully explains away rape crisis centers and all that wasted time and money district attorneys offices consume He also makes the absurd claim that Cuba has been the victim of terrorism for decades when Castro and company were great sponsors of it in Latin America Asia and Africa until the Soviet Union fell I can only guess that the UFO conspiracists are just waiting for Chomsky to proclaim that gray aliens have set up species mixing impregnation centers up in Idaho br br In his simpleminded world without grays Chomsky is frighteningly as dense as the members of Bushco whom he reviles are even more so since they lay no claim to being intellectuals In short Chomsky is a man living in the past in over his head on most issues and out of his depth intellectually Near this film s end he warns Be cautious when you hear about intellectuals being fighters for justice yet one can only laugh as the man seemingly has never met a revolutionary person nor idea that he didn t like no matter how barbarous their crimes and anti intellectual their posit Please pause before you waste your time and money on this silly and already irrelevant DVD
First off I agree with quite a bit that escapes Mr Chomsky s mouth His matter of fact delivery of interesting counterpoint is what makes the man a hit on the university campus circus He comes across likable unassuming pragmatic He doesn t cater to the current political style obnoxious bi partisanship and he sets his sights on the far left as well as the far right chastising both and for good reason br br Unfortunately the film itself is a dud In fact I would not even call this a documentary but rather just a collection of speeches Watching Rebel Without a Pause is no different from watching a speaker on a 3am taped segment on CSPAN There are no camera movements no edits no stylistic touches There is no story no narrative br br Technically speaking the production is strictly amateurish Audio is terrible and inconsistent sometimes we cannot hear Noam speak other times we cannot hear the questions that are being posited by those in attendance When Noam is speaking rarely are we allowed to see the reactions of the audience except when we are given a quick shot of his wife who apparently attends every one of his speeches and beams with pride every time we see her br br I cannot recommend this film and would say that you re probably better off checking out his taped speeches on cassette or CD to listen to in the car br br 4 out of 10 stars and I m in a generous mood today
A documentarist like any filmmaker must convey a compelling story Will Pascoe fails utterly in this effort cobbling together uninspired snippets of Chomsky s wisdom from a visit to McMaster University in Hamilton The footage is shot amateurishly and in video Pascoe s only effort at cohering the fragments into a whole is by periodically throwing a vague title on the screen 9 11 Activism Truth br br Lame br br Compare this with documentaries like The Corporation or The Fog of War which create a narrative drawing material from interviews stock footage and filmed footage In the end each delivers a poignant and insightful message deftly and intelligently br br The only saving graces of the film are Chomsky s nonchalantly delivered upendings of historical dogma and the fact that the running time is only 74 minutes br br One of the more interesting passages was Chomsky s recounting of his experience with National Public Radio He describes the conservative media as more accommodating to dissenting views while NPR s liberal dogma strait jackets its interviewees and dramatically limits its permitted messages Yet another media outlet to be skeptical of br br This documentary is for Noam Chomsky completists only
Except for the better than average acting skills of the two leads this movie is really really bad The cheap production values don t help Of course you wouldn t really notice that the production values are cheap if they didn t keep trying to convince you they HAD a production values to begin with Even for a B movie genre freak like myself this movie really sucks
This is a very cheaply made werewolf flick The video is dark and poorly lit The audio is uneven and poorly recorded and mixed The script is cliche ridden junk with the usual characters like the tough detective who shoots werewolves with his silver handgun filled of course with silver bullets The acting is as wooden as the characters The FX are non existent lots of extreme close ups of werewolf jaws and biting the only thing that is shown is lots of soft core T A Instead of dropping 30 for this tripe check out a really great recent werewolf pic Dog Soldiers with Sean Pertwee
What more can I say The acting was almost without exception amateurish The directing and continuity were pitiful The sceenplay was predictable down to the very last scene and the dialog tedious One of the features on the DVD was labeled Gag Reel but that could have been a description of a viewer s reaction to most of the movie br br One of the most amusing things was in the director s comments on the DVD He said with a straight face that he had set out to make a movie with high production values and a name cast and that he had succeeded With delusions like that it s easy to understand how the movie turned out as it did br br Perhaps the most disappointing aspect was the monster The darkwolf suit was a modified ape suit per the making of feature on the DVD and rather looked it The mask and claws were little better than off the shelf jobs from any costume store The cgi effects were painfully obvious and of quality similar to an inexpensive video game
This is only the second time I ve felt compelled enough to comment at imdb about a film The first time was for probably the best movie I ve ever seen and that was for Memento br br Seeing Darkwolf is at the other end of the scale compared to Memento as in the worst film I ve had the misfortune to see Apart from the two scenes containing naked women there is nothing in this movie to raise it from the trash pile that it is br br Let s see apalling effects cliched script bad acting and about 90 minutes too long My wife and I laughed through most of it in disbelief at how bad Amazingly I watched it to the end how I did that I don t know AVOID
All the bare chested women in the world couldn t keep me from hitting the stop button about a third of the way through this awful rubbish With the derisory acting equally terrible script plus the poor CGI FX to match this movie is an insult to the Werewolf genre It is supposed to be serious which in itself would be funny if this film could even make it to the level of being a bad joke br br This is one of those movies where the people behind the camera are obviously competent but are too lazy to make something even one quarter decent Avoid at all costs and watch one of the classic Werewolf movies instead br br 0 out of 10
Let me start by saying that I d read a number of reviews before renting this film and kind of knew what to expect Still I was surprised by just how bad it was br br I am a big werewolf fan and have grown accustomed to forgiving a great deal when watching one Most of them have sub par effects poor acting and weak storylines at best rehashed from earlier films So far with the possible exception of some of the later Howling series films this is the worst of the lot br br First the story It s been quoted several times in reviews on this site so I won t go into specifics However it is very obvious that the writer s had absolutely no affinity for lycanthropic monsters As so often happens when a horror film is given to a writer who considers themselves above such fare they tried to come up with a new spin on the werewolf mythos That s fine but a non horror fan trying to do this generally has disregard for the intelligence and sophistication of the horror audience and ends up writing down to them The plot feels like a parody of werewolf films and the events depicted just ring so false that I felt my intelligence was being seriously insulted TV news footage for example never pans away from the reporter to close up on someone in the crowd behind them Give the characters and the viewers credit for being able to spot the bad guy in the scene without using a flashing neon sign And that s just the tip of the iceberg br br As for effects I have NEVER seen a less believable werewolf I d have been happier with Lon Chaney Jr in crepe hair The beast they used look a great deal like well like a guy in a cheap rubber suit with some hair glued on and some truly awful animatronics And I know that many people have already criticized the CG but my God it was awful One scene features a woman changing and starts with a completely CG version of the actress nude but for some reason without nipples My first thought was hey why is one of the characters from ReBoot turning into a silly looking werewolf br br Anyway I like to look for positives in any film and there were a few The cinematography was passable the film was shot all digital which is interesting and some of the performances were not terrible It was also interesting seeing Tippi Hedron as the world s most well made up homeless woman and Kane Hodder as the title bad guy Also the Yellow Power Ranger got all growed up and well damn And if you re looking for skin there s some pretty tasty examples This ends the male pig segment of the review br br Overall if you want a good werewolf film try An American Werewolf in London the original The Howling Dog Soldiers or even The Wolfen though that one s got more wolf than were If you re a lycanthrope completest then take a gander Otherwise give this one a miss
There isn t much to say about this film it is horrible br br The acting and dialog are way far away from even decent the story of the hybrid werewolf s is not very well explained and the whole thing has plot holes here and there br br CGI is something you wouldn t like to see It so amateurish that it makes me vomit br br The only good thing on the DVD was in the Extras The gag reel Everything else just waste of time and money I hope noone will buy this this is not even worth renting br br Just stay away of this
I thought I was going to watch a scary movie and ended up laughing all the way throughout the movie In the scene where the human transformed to a werewolf I thought they was kidding Todays computer games have ten times better animations Low budget is a fitting comment I would recommend Wolf 1994 with Jack Nicholson for a good werewolf movie It has good special effects as they should be human transforming to werewolf Unless you wish to have good laugh I would not recommend you to watch this movie This movie is a joke
Man this movie sucked big time I didn t even manage to see the hole thing my girlfriend did though Really bad acting computer animations so bad you just laugh woman to werewolf strange clips the list goes on and on Don t know if its just me or does this movie remind you of a porn movie And I don t mean all the naked ladys It s something about the light or something This could maybee become a classic just because of the bad acting and all the naked women but not because it s an original movie white a nice plot twist My final words are Don t see it It s not worth the time If you wanna see it because the nakedness there s lots of better ones to see
This is the absolutely worst piece of crap I ve ever had to watch actually it was so bad that I just HAD to watch it br br The CGI is sooo bad it s fun It s not even close to the shitty CGI animations in Spawn that s how bad it is har har har br br I m amazed over the fact that some distribution company actually has put money down to release this on DVD but I guess they ll get more money out of it that way cos the cost of making it can not have been more than a few hundred dollars br br It s so awful that a kindergarten class could have made it br br See it and laugh
Hi I m a friend of werewolf movies and when i saw the title of Darkwolf hitting the shelves i was like hmm simple and nice name to it at least Althou i wonder why i haven t heard of it before br br First of all the movie starts with tits Lots of tits Tits are pretty much all this movies budget went to Who cares about a werewolf effect just pay the actresses enough to get topless shots br br So about the mysterious darkwolf character a little spoilers ahead but who really cares He s your average everyday biker Not even super tough looking but like the old wise woman says in the movie he is far more powerful and dangerous than you ve ever faced before Just by describing her a tattooed biker type of a guy Pretty original I even had look twice when they first used the red glowing eyes SPECIAL EFFECT I mean my god that lets plant red dots on eyes with computer effect has been used since the seventies It looks plain ugly here And don t get me started with the werewolf 3D CGI As said before like an bad and old video game br br And finally as i do like werewolf films like i said They prettymuch always build a werewolf legend of their own Darkwolf does build the werewolfworld as well about some silly legends of hybrid werewolves and the ancient bloodline BUT It almost instantly after creating the rules of engagement the darkwolf kills anyone the girl has touched starts random slashing Which just doesn t make any sense why even bother telling us the rules of killing when they aren t even gonna play by them Aplus the wolf point of view shots are made with a sony handycam or something filming mostly the floor and walls Just add growling noises and you ve got a super werewolf effect The gore is partially OK But when the wolf slashes everyone with an open hand just by basically laying the hand on top of the victims it just doesn t do the trick for me br br Truly WHO gives money to make these heaps of junk straight to video horrortitles they aren t even funny kind of bad movies just sad
This flick reminded me of those lame erotic thrillers I used to stay up late and watch on Cinemax when I was 13 I d label this flick softer core since there is just no simulated bump and grinder There is however a ton of nudity the opening scene is in a strip club we see Kane Hodder s keester or at least a stunt butt and then an inexplicable 10 minute lesbian dance scene in the middle of the film and a nude female werewolf who looks like they mugged on of the Munster s for a costume 13 year old boys rejoice br br Other than that the werewolf transformation scenes have the worst CGI I ve seen in years The shots look like FMV s from the video game Resident Evil in terms of quality The wolf is too bad to be explained and despite the poor quality of the suit is shown way way too many times br br The plot and acting make no sense There is some oddball back story about werewolves and hybrid werewolves the Darkwolf is the latter but from what I can tell hybrids do the same thing all werewolves do look human change to a wolf an kill people The Darkwolf is trying to find a mate but oddly can t find the mate but can sniff out anyone she touches Once more this skills proves less than useful since the Darkwolf winds up killing several folks his target never touched met or even saw as best I can tell The mate doesn t know she s a werewolf and she s fighting the transformation or something br br You d think it d be hard to mess up a simple monster movie s bad as this but well they did Want quality low end werewolf ism go rent Dog soldiers want a ton of T A this is your flick
Where to start I feel violated Thats right violated I just spent 1 5hrs of my life 1 5hrs that I could have spent doing something more useful like watching paint dry on this so called horror flick br br Its not scary its not funny its not dramatic its no action its nothing br br Its predictable its boring its tragic br br I might come of a bit harsh here but watch this movie and you will feel the same way or no don t watch it unless you want to feel violated also
Well no not really Its not really a good movie but its not as bad as I thought it was going to be I really didn t feel ripped off of my rental money and sometimes thats all you can ask for The plot is OK nothing brilliant or new the acting is pretty bad but the cast is pretty The directing is passable but the effects are horrible especially the werewolf effects which in a werewolf movie is a pretty big problem There was a fairly decent amount of nudity which to me is a pretty good thing but it wasn t all that hot All in all its a fairly average direct to video movie not the worst film I ve ever seen and if you re bored a genre fan check it out sometime I d even watch it again br br Bonus fact for horror geeks Kane Hodder Jason Vorhees in a few of them plays the werewolf
I have nothing to comment on this movie It is so bad that I had to put my first comment on IMDb website to help some viewers save some time and do something more interesting instead of watching this movie anything will do even stare at the walls is better br br And because I have to write minimum 10 lines of text i tell you also is a low budget movie bad acting no name actors a stupid mutt as the wolf and so on Also the story brings nothing new the special effects are made in the 80 s style br br The movie is almost as bad as the movie Megalodon br br So have fun not watching this movie
This is the prime example of low budget winning over what would be a good story line Let s bring back Samaire Armstrong having seen her work on the O C I know she can do better then find a better script and budget br br The special effects were so bad and mostly badly computer generated that it almost lost me with the first time the wolf was seen on screen And Samaire Armstrong s alert changing into a werewolf was done by reducing her at first to a bad GCIF figure before she even begins to change Final Fantasy s humans as well as Pixar s made these laughable think of the figure as a nude Barbie Doll br br The story of was interesting though the idea of bloodline in werewolves is nothing new As it also got into the balance between evil maybe not so evil and the possible end of human kind should the two lines mate The subplot of a book of werewolf linage which effected some of the other characters in a spell like manner for a while was effective but could have been expanded more in explaining what had happened in the past br br Bring in a better script and direction and I d come back again
Recap Full moon A creature a huge werewolf is on the hunt Not for flesh not for blood not that it seem to mind to take a bite on the way though but for a mate He is on the hunt for a girl Not any girl though The Girl The girl that is pure and also a werewolf although she doesn t know it yet Three well check that two cops after the first scene and an old bag lady is all that can stop it or even knows that the thing killing and eating a lot of folks around full moon is a werewolf This particular powerful werewolf Darkwolf is closing in on the girl If he gets her mankind is doomed Now the cops has to find the girl convince her not only that there is someone a werewolf nonetheless that wants to rape her and perhaps kill her but that she is a werewolf herself And then they got to stop him br br Comments This is one for the boys the teenage boys A lot of scenes with semi nude girls more or less important for the plot Mostly less Well I guess you need something to fill some time because the plot is expectedly thin And unfortunately there is little besides the girls to help the plot from breaking One usually turns to two main themes Nudity Check And then special effects Hmm Well there are some things that you might call effects They re not very special though In fact to be blunt they are very bad The movie seems to be suffering of a lack of funds They couldn t afford clothes for some of the girls and the effects are cheap Some of the transformations between werewolf and human form obviously done by computer are really bad You might overlook such things But the Darkwolf in itself is very crude too and you never get to see any killings Just some mutilated corpses afterwards And there is surprisingly little blood about in a movie that honestly should be drenched in blood br br I m not sure what to say about actors and characters Most of the times they do well but unfortunately there are lapses were the characters or actors just looses it A few of these lapses could be connected with the problems mentioned above Like the poor effects or the poor budget That could explain why there is precious little shooting even if the characters are armed like a small army and the target is in plain sight and not moving But hey when you re in real danger there nothing that will save your life like a good one liner br br Unfortunately that can t explain moments when the Cop Steve the only one who knows how to maybe deal with the problem the werewolf that is runs away when the only things he can be sure of is that the werewolf is coming for the girl who is just beside him now and that he cannot let it have her But sure it let the makers stretch the ending a little more br br But I wouldn t mind seeing none of the lead actors actresses get another try in another movie br br Well To give a small conclusion Not a movie that I recommend br br 3 10
I watched this film alone in the dark and it was full moon outside I didn t do it in purpose it just happened in this way So all the elements were there for this film to scare the hell out of me Well it didn t in fact i wanted to shut off the DVD player after only 8 minutes but i thought come on give it a chance unfortunately i did The acting was awful the only one with some decent acting was Samaire Armstrong The plot is not original if you are a horror fan then it is just the same stuff you have seen many times before Some scenes didn t make sense at all and you just get the feeling that the director wanted to make the movie longer The monster was the biggest disappointment of the movie The scary scenes looked like they belong to a horror movie from the 80s when there was not enough technology yet some good movies were made back then I was surprised to see the name of a major production company at the beginning of the movie i thought couldn t they put some money in this and make it decent I couldn t agree more with the ratings that the movie got it is also my rating for it 3 out of 10
DarkWolf tells the tale of a young waitress named Josie Samaire Armstrong who had been leading a pretty ordinary life until her friend Mary Tippi Hedren is killed by a Werewolf you see Werewolves actually exist in modern day America there is even a special organisation within the police force to fight the Werewolf threat headed up by Detective Steve Turley Ryan Olosio who has the difficult task of telling Josie that she is in fact a pure blooded Werewolf herself that a so called dark prince Werewolf Kane Hodder wants to mate with her create a new breed of pure blood Werewolves that will take over the entire world or something like that Understandably Josie has a hard time believing it that is until she sees the evidence with her own eyes It s up to Werewolf cop Steve to save Josie the day the world br br Co executive produced directed Richard Friedman I thought DarkWolf was a pretty bad low budget shot on a digital camcorder horror film that didn t really do anything for me The script by Geoffrey Alan Holliday starts out promisingly enough being set in a strip club with plenty of naked breasts on show then there s a Werewolf attack which leaves someone splattered everywhere but after this decent opening sequence it s pretty much down hill all the way I m afraid For a start it s slow going it s dull it s predictable it s populated with highly annoying character s who come out with lots of bad dialogue do stupid things like when they have the opportunity to shoot the Werewolf they don t I have no idea why but they prefer to just stand there instead The script is dumb doesn t explain itself why has Josie never turned into a Werewolf before Is she really the only one Why can t this dark prince find another female Werewolf There are also lots of other things which make little or no sense like an ancient book which at fist seems quite important but is then totally forgotten about half way through but you get the idea anyway as a whole the film plods along in very linear fashion to a very predictable climatic showdown that is underwhelming to say the least br br Director Friedman lights the film quite well with bright neon but this is noting new or original doesn t really improve the film as a spectacle Now let s talk special effects or rather the lack of them because the effects in DarkWolf are far from special the Werewolf transformation is achieved using CGI it s among the worst looking CGI I ve ever seen seriously a Playstation would be embarrassed about these computer graphics It s easily the worst Werewolf transformation I ve ever seen An American Werewolf in London 1981 was made over 25 years ago yet the special effects in that are literally light years ahead of the ones seen in DarkWolf who says special effects have improved over the years The animatronic puppet effects aren t much better either although at least there s something psychical on screen The gore isn t up to much after a gory opening kill there s some blood splatter plenty of dead bodies but not much else Thre s a fair amount of female nudity if that s your thing but don t get too excited because you still have to sit through a terrible film to see it is it really worth it br br Technically DarkWolf is alright apart from possibly the worst CGI effect ever it s reasonably well made it at least seems to have production values The acting is what you d expect really br br DarkWolf is yet another low budget piece of crap horror film that litter video shop shelves clutter the schedules of obscure cable TV stations I didn t think it was as bad as some but it s like saying going to the dentist is slightly more fun than going to a funeral although when all said done they re both horrible still
Why bother seeing this movie if you have great movies to see It is a total waste of time and money The movie is so bad that I felt bad for wanting to watching it Everything in it is BAD Actors were bad Script was REALLY bad The story is stupid And the worst CGI EVER The only good moments were the first 60 seconds of the movie in the strip club One interesting thing that there is a characther that we wish that he dies because he is so stupid that we get enough of him I don t remember the name but was the BOYFRIEND of the Chosen One br br NOTE If you want to see a good movie this movie isn t the right choice 0 Stars out of 10
Another in a long line of flicks made by people who think that knowing how to operate a camera is the same as telling a story Within 15 minutes the entire premise is laid out in just a few lines so there is absolutely no mystery which eliminates a whole facet of the suspense The only half way competent actor is killed 10 minutes into the film so we re left with stupid characters running around doing stupid things Low budget films can t afford expensive special effects so the CGI portions are unsurprisingly unimpressive but were at least a valid attempt The creature suit is terrible as seen when it falls to the sidewalk and the director keeps emphasizing the eyes which aren t even the red color shown in mirror shots The dialogue is clumsy and uninspired with some lines reminiscent of Aliens or Terminator The last action sequence takes place in a police station also a rip off from Terminator with everyone hiding in the one glass lined office that the Darkwolf doesn t smash into In the end the girl calls the hero a good Protector but he gets both his partners the original Protector and at least three other civilians not to mention a dozen cops all killed without getting a decent shot off in spite of an arsenal of silver bullets and a submachine gun But here s the real clincher for bad writing They could have killed the beast right after the beginning credits when it was holding the stripper while flashing its red eyes Instead they took it into custody
This move was on TV last night I guess as a time filler because it sucked bad The movie is just an excuse to show some tits and ass at the start and somewhere about half way Not bad tits and ass though But the story is too ridiculous for words The wolf if that is what you can call it is hardly shown fully save his teeth When it is fully in view you can clearly see they had some interns working on the CGI because the wolf runs like he s running in a treadmill and the CGI fur looks like it s been waxed all shiny br br The movie is full of gore and blood and you can easily spot who is going to get killed slashed eaten next Even if you like these kind of splatter movies you will be disappointed they didn t do a good job at it br br Don t even get me started on the actors Very corny lines and the girls scream at everything about every 5 seconds But then again if someone asked me to do bad acting just to give me a few bucks then hey where do I sign up br br Overall boring and laughable horror
The only reason I even watched this was because I found it at my local library and will berate them mercilessly for having wasted public monies on it and despite the plethora of tits and ass it didn t take long to realize that the fast forward button was my friend Terrible direction pedestrian camera work sporadically bad to nearly passable acting chintzy effects and one of the worst screenplays I ve had the displeasure of seeing brought to life such as it was horribly crippled and mutilated in a long long time Best laughs actually come from the Making of featurette in which the poor saps involved with this HDV mess attempt to justify their lame efforts as if they had been working on something special instead of something that won t be utterly forgotten next week Wait Except for the fact that somehow someone lured Tippi The Birds Hedren of all people into doing a bit part along with Kane Friday the 13th Hodder How this came to pass I ll never know and to be honest I don t really care Watch at your own risk and don t say you haven t been warned This is film making at its pretentious craven worst It only gets a 2 from me for having some good looking naked women and even then just barely
Dark Wolf Quick Review Let s get right to it This is a repugnant piece of rotting roadkill with cow sh t on it It s just an awful movie It s an urban werewolf movie with some of the worst acting imaginable and a story as weak as any gangly nerd from an 80 s high school drama film What s worse is that poor Kane Hodder was duped into playing the gigantic evil werewolf Kane f cking Hodder Someone s trying to ensure that playing Jason Voorhees is the height of his film career br br Anyway former Playmate Jaime Bergman is also in the movie and she eventually becomes a werewolf too It s kind of a crappy cop drama with the world s worst looking werewolf in it But it does have moments of near rampant nudity But that s about all Want to know more Okay the werewolf is generally an ugly looking black blur zipping around the screen And when we re privileged enough to actually see a transformation sequence we re presented with something that resembles a full motion video from a video game made during the early stages of the Playstation The first Playstation The CG animation is really that primitive Only good for horror hardcore fanatics that want to see small moments of nudity surrounded by rampant visual vomit 2 10 br br www ResidentHazard com
Hip Erotic Wickedly sexy whatever It s The Terminator with werewolves br br No seriously The cop saves the girl waitress from the big monster and refers to himself as her protector The lead actor Ryan Alosio does a pretty good job of emulating Kyle Reese there s a massacre in a police precinct the bad guy is muscular with red eyes and it even contains dialogue along the lines of You said it yourself he won t ever stop Never The dire script comes from a first time screenwriter who thank God hasn t sold anything since this and it s all thrown together by famously bad director Richard Friedman br br The movie opens in a strip bar always a good sign and a mean looking biker guy bursts in for no apparent reason pursued by three cops One of them is black and shock horror he s the one who gets killed in the first five minutes The film goes downhill for the next hour or so then picks up a little with some decent action sequences before rounding it all up with an abysmal ending br br For the most part the cast come across as competent actors doing what they can with a bad script and a director who s willing to settle for less If nothing else they appear to be learning how to act in this movie and Alosio along with some of the supporting cast shows signs of talent DarkWolf in his human form is played by gargantuan Kane Hodder famous for his numerous portrayals of Jason Vorhees in the Friday the 13th movies He s decent enough especially considering he isn t used to speaking roles br br It s become famous amongst groups of horny teenage boys for the lesbian rooftop scene between Andrea Bogart and Sasha Williams who gets her kit off a couple of times in the grand tradition of former Power Rangers actresses And it s unnervingly clear that the editor spent WAY too much time on that scene anyway the main redeeming feature is that the physical werewolf effects are rather good and the design of the wolf isn t bad at all But the CGI is bad Just plain bad I mean seriously if you can t reach some level of realism why bother Just throw a little extra money into the make up Aside from the terrible script this movie does have it s moments many of which are unintentionally funny It s good for a laugh if you don t have anything better to do but just don t spend any money on it Please
What a horrible horrible film The worst collection of cliches I have seen in a long time Not that I saw much I left the theatre screaming after about 40 minutes in search of a stiff drink to soothe my nerves Meryl Streep was awful as usual How many hurt and tortured expressions can 1 person have Aidan Quinn s talents were as so often totally wasted And who told Gloria Estefan she could act Trying to be polically correct this movie still enforces racial stereotypes Brave inexperienced lonely music teacher teaches underprivilegded kids violin in poor neighbourhood school The kids weren t even cute Just written in to suit the appalling script Aaargh Wes Craven really made me cringe for once real horror this one
I saw this movie at a sneak preview and i must honestly confess that I do not like films with Meryl Streep that much This picture was the worst Half the theatre did not return after the break halfway the film I couldnt blame them if this wasn t a true story there had been absolutely no need for the second half of the picture Just before the film goes forward in time about ten years I myself was expecting the credits to appear
This kind of inspirational saccharine is enough to make you sick It telegraphs its sentiments like the biggest semaphore on earth It removes from the audience its own interpretation and feeling by making the choices for it The big finish is swimming in weeping orchestration that must supposed to work like jumper cables on a dead car I guess you d need such prompting to feel if you re stupid enough to watch a film as simple minded and sappy as this Streep glows and you wonder if she really has the depth of feeling on display or if it s just that a display switched on and off like a light Because I can t for the life of me see how she could possibly find life in such a dud of film Even though it s based on a true story and an inspirational one at that I m sure the set up execution and performances play like a third rate TV movie or half witted high school drama
Nacho Libre 2006 br br Directed By Jared Hess br br Starring Jack Black Ana de la Reguera Héctor Jiménez Darius Rose br br MPAA Rating PG 13 for some rough action and crude humor including dialog br br Say what you will about it I know some people who despise it to no end but I have always thought that Napoleon Dynamite was a funny movie not the brightest brick on the wall but a funny movie nonetheless Jack Black is also a very funny man irritating at times yes and massively overrated by adolescent audiences who practically worship him but funny There has rarely been a Jack Black comedy that I did not enjoy to some degree So I was very happy to hear that Jared Hess the writer and director of Napoleon Dynamite and Jack Black would be teaming up for a movie about a Spanish friar who becomes a wrestler to save an orphanage My only reservation was that the plot seemed a little too thin Unfortunately my one reservation turned out to be downfall of the entire movie This plot had it been done as a skit on some such show as Saturday Night Live or possibly even Mad TV would have worked flawlessly Unfortunately the plot runs far too thin over the approximate one and a half hour runtime and this one joke comedy falls flat br br Nacho was raised in a Mexican monastery and became a devout man of the Lord Feeling shunned by the entire monastery Nacho Black now the monastery s cook decides to follow his dreams to become a professional wrestler As the monastery s finances hit an all time low Nacho decides to join a wresting tournament so that he can win the prize money and provide good food for the monastery s orphanage This plot sounds so sweet and caring It seems like the perfect movie for Jack Black Look what he did with School of Rock after all Well to my displeasure this plot is almost completely ruined by offensive and gross humor that just takes away from the heart of the movie It is again Hollywood s way of showing that they feel that teen audiences will only understand fart jokes and stupid humor of course for all I know maybe that is the general thought of teenagers as many seemed to enjoy this movie Watching an obese woman scurry like a mouse across the floor will certainly make people laugh but don t expect to get an award for putting it in your movie A seven year old could make up the same joke br br The performances in Nacho Libre are actually good Jack Black proves once again that he is absolutely hilarious and that he can make even the most idiotic worthless lines in ever put on paper comical Unfortunately this movie just wasn t enough for him It didn t give him anything to go on and the only reason any of his jokes worked was because of him I had never seen or heard of Ana de la Reguera before but now I can say that not only is she quite talented but she is also one of the most beautiful women to have ever graced my eyesight She just clicked in the role and it worked wonderfully well Héctor Jiménez who plays Nacho s bumbling partner Esqueleto kept me laughing continuously He did a very nice job and it was very effective when partnered with that of Jack Black s Darius Rose who plays an orphan named Chancho didn t have many lines but what can I say I just enjoyed him He was adorable The rest of the cast did their job It is unfortunate that they were wasted on such a sub par movie br br Nacho Libre just does not work Its plot is stretched far too thin The heart of it all is soiled by moronic humor and sickening jokes that just don t work I very rarely laughed and if I did it was because of Jack Black or another member of the cast And that leads me to the bright side of Nacho Libre yes the cast This cast was just well for lack of a better word they were on They all clicked had excellent chemistry together and pumped as much life as possible into the flat script After Jared Hess s Napoleon Dynamite kept me thoroughly entertained for the entirety of the movie I was surprised to find myself so often bored with Nacho Libre Something was lost here and I have yet to understand what it was All I know is that Nacho Libre is not a good movie and yet because of its cast it is completely worthless There is a small reason to watch if only to watch Jack Black work But if you are not a fan of Jack Black then avoid this movie like the plague I like Black but I am done with this movie and with this review br br Final Thought Yikes This is Jared Hess s surprisingly disappointing follow up to his hysterical Napoleon Dynamite br br Overall Rating 4 10 C
Jack Black is an annoying character This is an annoying indie movie for 14 year olds Do I have to write eight more lines Ana de la Reguera is dang fine to look at as a Mexican nun who puts up with the rather forward and rude advances of Jack Black This movie is a PG 13 version of an indie film I really like a movie that has the courage to explore Mexican culture This movie explores Mexican culture deeply I just choke on its cultural rudeness Jack Black is just so rude A white person like Jack Black is not my most valuable emissary into Mexican culture as it were Mexican Wrestling culture is not the most diaphanous venue a white guy such as myself could seek I suspect Mexico is more culturally opaque than Jack Black has presented here br br I think IMDb changed my review Has anyone else had his review changed as well Just a question
We loved School of Rock and Jack Black We couldn t wait to go and see this movie It was the only time in my life the movie was so bad I wanted to walk out My husband hated it too The only funny parts were in the trailers My husband and I wanted to stand outside the movie theater and tell people to save their money The writing was awful It had every terrible stereotype of Hispanic people who should be utterly offended The movie wasn t that long but to us it seemed like an eternity The people in the theater were so restless and silent it was like watching paint dry I made my husband stay because I was sure there would maybe be some redeeming parts but there weren t Save you money and your time
What a disappointment br br This film seemed to be trying to copy cutting edge comedy but the direction and the script was sloppy sickly and sentimental in the worst film tradition Jack Black s acting role was self indulgent and self regarding and the other characters were equally unmasking and uninteresting The soundtrack was tedious We are WERE fans of Black but none of us did more than mange a forced titter for the duration Why did he feel he needed to make this mistake br br We will not watch another of his films without reading reviews more carefully first br br Was he drunk when he read the script before signing up for this drivel
I mean really either i suddenly lost my sense of humor or this is just a really bad movie It s stupid ridiculous and just not funny AT ALL br br Since i saw the preview i knew it wasn t going to be a great movie i just didn t think it was gonna be that bad br br What happened to the good old times when you could find clever funny lines at any movie When the actors didn t have to play ridiculous roles in attempt to be funny Now we find ourselves with movies like this one Borat Little Men Scary Movie 4 where i could not find the funny parts br br Just skip this piece of garbage br br P S sorry for my English
I m sure deep in the recesses of Jack Blacks mind the character of Nacho Libre is absolutely hilarious but no it isn t You can tell ol Jacks having a whale of a time hammin it up playing a smarmy slimy Mexican friar with dreams of becoming a wrestler but this movie is a total misfire in just about every single department br br I just sat there through most of the movie thinking Is this supposed to be funny and This is the guy from Tenacious D right The truth is this film has NOTHING to offer AT ALL It s a lousy script with crappy characters and really naff acting and direction You ll watch endless moments where you think something funny is surely about to happen but it just doesn t I was bored stupid about 10 minutes in but though it would surely pick up It didn t 90 minutes later I d barely managed to stave off an aneurism it was that painful br br It s like remember years ago when you d see anything with your fave actor in it even some of their really early pap from before they were famous and you d be really embarrassed that said actor was actually in such a load of plop Yeah it s like that br br I ve enjoyed some of Jack Black s earlier movies like Shallow Hall and I m really looking forward to seeing Pick of Destiny but come on man If you do this to us again Jack I m gonna have to come round there and hammer your kneecaps or something At the least give you a serious talking to br br I know it s a cliché but this is one of the worst movies I ve ever seen and for so many reasons
Jack Black can usually make me snicker simply by breathing but in this movie br br Besides the direction writing lack of plot constant mugging aided and abetted by constant straight on camera shots and a 050 joke batting average it was still an utter waste of time The idea sounds promising but what potential there was gets wasted with an utter lack of comedy and some of the worst direction I ve seen this side of you tube br br I kept hearing that this film portrayed Mexicans very negatively While that s no doubt true I really don t think this movie is meant to be racist I think that s it s more a result of a creative team desperately trying to find something funny in this mess You can almost hear them crying out from behind the camera Hey look it s an ugly Mexican Laugh people Please for the love of all things tenacious LAUGH br br But put the racism charges aside When you get down to it it s anyone who plunked down good money and time to watch this pile of leftover refried beans that should be offended IMO
A Mexican priest becomes a wrestler to save an orphanage or something br br I went to see this movie because it was about non WWF wrestling and so I thought it might be funny It wasn t It is excruciating to watch Embarrassing Any and every opportunity for comedy is mercilessly squandered br br I admit I don t like Jack Black anyway After this I have been racking my brain to think of one good role that he has performed The only thing I can come up with where he was o k was as a necessary foil to the John Cusack character in High Fidelity Jack Black is one of those awful relentless flat out ham it up knockabout guys like the little fat one in Abbot Costello or Jerry Lewis who should be told that being overbearingly idiotic is not the same thing as being funny br br It is not even slapstick It s just irritating It s not even stoopid it s just stupid br br I heard good things about Napoleon Dynamite too but if this is anything to go by I wont be rushing out to find it on DVD
Are you kidding me A show highlighting someone who opens cans and envelopes for a meal How talented do you have to be to do this She MAY be able to cook but it is NOT portrayed in this half hour stomach churning painful production I know she has a Martha Stewart esquire empire So does Warren Buffett but I don t see him with fake knockers opening cans of cream corn and Alpo br br She has a nephew named Brycer Brycer Stop talking about anyone a name that stupid br br More time is spent on table scapes than actual cooking Who has that kind of time Silicon should be on your spatula not on my TV This show should be on Cartoon Network NOT Food Network
There is a reason why this made for British TV movie only appeared at the 1977 Toronto Film Festival It is dull plodding and lacking in suspense br br Peter OÕTooleÕs diffident performance and the appearance of playwright Harold Pinter are the only elements of interest br br Note Some British film fans will enjoy seeing Philip Jackson best known for his portrayal of Inspector Japp in the Poirot television series in one of his earliest roles
Very much a film from the times extremely long sequences with no dialogue bad flashbacks and an almost entirely male cast The two women who appear have a total of under 10 lines and exist only as romantic interests for men br br O Toole is riveting whenever he speaks unfortunately he spends much of his time peering through shrubbery Alastair Sims is always a joy to see but he too is terribly underused br br The film has one additional positive aspect in that it depicts many aspects of British fascism and fascist sympathies such as the casual appearance of the Mosley graffiti that many people today are unaware of Too many of today s films about WWII paint the Allies as all good and the Axis as all evil when history tells us people are far more complicated than that br br This would be a good movie for when you re recovering from the flu and are bundled on the couch and not able to absorb anything too complex If you just need something to pass the time while your electrolytes stabilize this is the movie for you
2002 s undeservedly popular I Love the 80 s is an inane idiotic offensive and downright disgusting pop culture mess of a show that was the first in a long line of horrid television programming that ultimately spelled out the end of VH1 which was at one time the only real music oriented channel left on TV I used to practically live on VH1 up until the spring or winter I forget which one now of 2002 when garbage like this started to appear for absolutely no reason whatsoever Out of sheer morbid curiosity I d guess that s what you d call it I had decided that I would go ahead and give it a look see anyhow the first night it came on even though the advertisements looked like complete crap At least I can honestly say that I wasn t a bit disappointed by it because my expectations were obviously bottom basement level to begin with The emphasis of this show I found out within the first 5 minutes was less on each year of the 1980 s and what was and wasn t culturally significant or popular which is what I was expecting to see but instead more of an impromptu platform for a whole slew of really god awful no name comedians to display what they more than likely think is their comedic skills rolls eyes more like lack thereof if you ask me It s pretty easy now to see why no one had ever heard of any of these idiots before they appeared on this show because they are all so terribly unfunny and pathetic in their attempts at so called humor that I swear I could feel my intestines knot up with each and every rancid one liner they shot off one after another Altogether I have no problem in saying that I Love the 80 s was is trash of the lowest denominator and one of the main reasons why I almost never watch VH1 anymore
If it wasn t for the bad dialogues and script I mean the direction was really in touch with it s subject The actors were doing good at bringing their characters to life But in the end the thing that was really missing was a solid script to hold all the pieces together I would highly suggest not to watch this Unless you re a Al Pacino enthusiast like I am and will watch everything he is playing in Even if the result lately are rather poor This is after S1m0ne a second very bad movie for this actor that once knew how to choose roles
Al Pacino Kim Basinger Tea Leoni Ryan O Neal Richard Schiff My mouth was watering I dropped everything to watch this movie on Cable 30 minutes in I was having trouble staying awake 60 minutes in and I hit the record button and fell asleep Finished watching it the next morning Shouldn t have bothered What a waste of a great cast and an idea that could have been an interesting story of a Day in the Life Cure your insomnia if you have it and watch this movie I guarantee you at least an hour and a half of uninterrupted sleep Dialogue horrible Continuity non existent Camera work could have been done with a hand held Super 8 and looked better br br This movie was a total disaster
Unless somebody enlightens me I really have no idea what this movie is about It looks like a picture with a message but it s far from it This movie tells pointless story of a New York press agent and about his problems And that s basically all When that agent is played by Pacino one must think that it must be something important But it takes no hard thinking to figure out how meaningless and dull this movie is To one of the best actors in the world Al Pacino this is the second movie of the year the other is Simone that deserves the title the most boring and the most pointless motion picture of the year So what s going on Al
Saw this movie in an early preview and I cannot stress enough how bad I thought this film was From the very beginning the audience was groaning over Pacino s awful southern accent Poor Al looked really really haggard and I can t decide whether this was purposely part of his role as a drug addicted publicist or perhaps he just didn t get any sleep before coming to the set Much worse than Pacino s close ups however is the wretched excuse for a plot Early in the film we are given indications that Pacino s character is gay and I suspect that is what the screenwriter had originally intended Later however we are supposed to suspend our incredulity and believe that both Tea Leoni and Kim Basinger both of whom are sleepwalking through lame roles lust after this elderly half dead looking effeminate man with the ridiculous accent The worst part overall was the main plot thread which had to do with some corporate espionage that is never fully explained and we never ever care about in the slightest Because this was a preview I will reserve my final judgment because of the possibility of re shoots and editing but you can bet I will not pay a cent to see this in theaters
In what seemed like the longest 1hour 35 I ve had to endure in a long time Al Pacino delivers an accurate performace to be sure Not his usual typecasting which was nice But his character was just truely pathetic Someone to pitty as he stumbles around forgetting appointments as we realise that the Hollywood social life has drained him of his life energy But in this movie we needed someone to like And for some reason every character in the picture said I don t know why I like you Eli to Al Pacino s chracter and I couldn t even come close to liking him br br All the other actors played their usual styles Tea Leoni Richard Schiff and Bill Nunn did nothing to change their established personas developed on TV or in earlier films And Kim Basinger wasn t even in the film long enough to deliver a performance of any kind br br The movie s story had no momentum Most scenes never driving the story forward but rather just collecting factoids about characters which later came into play in an anti climactic ending It had potential except for their unwillingness to build upon the story br br Whats the point of the film Daniel Algrant and Jon Robin Baitz would have you believe Once Hollywood has you you can t get out Yeah right And that s why so many people get fired in Hollywood
Firstly I must admit that it isn t a good movie And I would never watch this movie if Pacino wasn t in it br br The movie is about a publicist s strange 24 hours And he is overworked dizzy sick and sometimes regretful I don t like the character at all It s really boring after 20 minutes you may fall asleep And I don t understand why Pacino wanted to be a part of this horrible movie Just because of money or what br br Since I m an avid Pacino fan I bought this 2002 movie People I Know If you haven t bought it yet don t even think about it it s just a waste of time
Much as we all love Al Pacino it was painful to see him in this movie A publicity hack at the grubby ending of what seems to have once been a distinguished and idealistic career Pacino plays his part looking like an unmade bed and assaulting everyone with a totally bogus and inconsistent southern accent br br The plot spools out this way and that with so many loose ends and improbabilities that the mind reels and then retreats br br Kim Basinger is there not doing much Her scenes with Pacino are flat and unconvincing Hard to believe they meant a lot to each other There s no energy there br br Tea Leone on the other hand lit up the screen She was electric and her scenes with Pacino were by far the most interesting in the movie but not enough to save Al from embarrassment
The only good thing about People I Know is that it serves as a perfect example of movies that Al Pacino should avoid performing in The first big turn off I had was the way in which Pacino tried to portray a Georgia accent at times it was weak and unattractive while in other segments it seemed too overdone Dialogue and character interaction was terrible along with a weak plot The supporting cast did an extremely perfunctory job in keeping the movie interesting and within an hour I still saw no signs of a sturdy plot The story overall is a real bore and I had to slap myself in the face a few times to keep myself awake br br This movie will surely bore you as well avoid at all costs
The movie is about two stories one is a political murder of a call girl the other an upper class political party The crossing point is the public relation character played by Al Paccino as he is the witness of the crime and the instigator of the evening br br If the script is terrible without any decent dialogs and the directing void of any sense of drama the performance of Al is memorable how many fellows can be as much convincing as a powerful and feared man as The Godfather as here as a little servant see also Donnie Brasco br br Actually the big young lion has become a tired old one This passing of ages is very moving because it makes the audience ponders about getting old too br br But his slowness is only a make up because he can get back his energy in Church scene br br Maybe it is a good thing that the movie is so awful because it put the starlight on Al s talent
Very silly movie filled with stupid one liners and Jewish references thru out It was a serious movie but could not be taken seriously A familiar movie plot Being at the wrong place at the wrong time An atrocious subplot involving Kim Bassinger Very robotic and too regimented I have noticed that Al Pacinos acting abilities seem to be going downhill A troubleshooter with troubles but nothing more troubling than Pacinos horrible Atlanta accent Damage control needs to fix this damage of a film OK my one liners are bad but not as bad as the ones in this film This movie manages to not only be boring but revolting as well Usually a revolting film is watchable for the wrong reasons This movie is unwatchable I did manage to sit through this The plot if written a tad bit better with perhaps a little better acting and eliminating the horrendous subplot and even dumber jokes could have pulled this thriller out of the doldrums What we are left with is a dull silly movie that made sure it was drilled into our heads that Eli Wurman was Jewish An embarrassment to all the good Jewish folk everywhere
People I Know is a clunker with no one to root for and no one to care about despite the game efforts of a talented cast br br Pacino delivers his usual tour de force as Eli Wurman a past his prime publicity agent hollowed out by a lifetime of moral corruption But unlike Michael Corleone it s impossible to have an emotional investment in this character his dilemma or his fate br br The film traces Eli s preparations for a benefit for a liberal political cause while distracted by a client s Ryan O Neal good in an underwritten part latest dirty laundry in this case a TV actress companion who s gotten involved with the wrong people Tea Leoni brings her customary star power to this supporting role although again the script doesn t give her much to work with As Eli s sister in law Kim Basinger manages to evoke sympathy despite implausible plot mechanics br br This movie is strictly for those who like watching Pacino strut his stuff and enjoy the other principals Unfortunately between the script and direction People I Know is strictly amateurish Hence its limited theatrical release and speedy journey to DVD Consider yourself warned
This is a truly terrible film br br I m only writing this so that some people somewhere are put off watching it If I have stopped one person from wasting some of their precious life watching this film I shall die happy br br Unutterably dull although since it stars Al Pacino I was fooled into thinking that at any moment something interesting was going to happen Then the credits rolled and I realised I had been completely fooled into watching this unbelievable drivel br br I cannot believe that this film has achieved as high a score as it has at IMDb over 5 stars when I last saw the voting Are you people voting ironically br br Please please please do not watch this film
Yes MTV there really is a way to market Daria What started as a clever teenage angst comment on everything that sucks and make the viewer feel better about their sucky teenage life sitcom now mutated into a how you should deal with your problems charade I used to watch Daria all the time and loved it Now sitting here after watching the so called movie I can only wonder what the point of this all was Daria tells us how to lead out life in college Excuse me didn t the point Daria made every episode that what you like to do is ok as long as it is ok with yourself no matter what the rest of the sick sad world thinks of it This entire thing reminded me of the scene in Reality Bites the movie channel shows the documentry for the first time
I wanted to watch this movie but one bizarre ridiculous scene after another forced me to shut it off Character s don t seem to react to anything Consider this Heath Ledger is walking a night through a cemetery I believe when he is attacked by spirits which he drives away Once past this ordeal he calmly walks away and meets up with a friend that saw it all When asked what happen he says blandly attacked by demons nothing serious as if this is only a little more exciting than a flat tire br br I shut it off when they go to ask something a demon or something I stopped caring a ques ion The answer can only be rented out of someone with the energy of their death and the priest watch in what appears to be vague annoyance as a man is strung up and hung and they ask his thrashing dying body question br br 0 out of stars
The orders fatal flaw besides an asinine plot is that the character s simply don t resonate or even react br br Two examples A priest walking through a graveyard late at night is suddenly attacked by ghostly spirits After fighting them off he calmly resumes his walk when his buddy come up Anything wrong His buddy asks having seen the attack Just some demonic spirits nothing I couldn t handle No reaction no surprise just like he d changed a tire His buddy is equally unconcerned must be standard priest training And then you put the wafer into their mouths Any questions Ok moving on Demon Spirit attacks br br Example two At one point the priests need an answer to a question and only a demon or something who cared by now could provide it How Why you have to ask a dying man So the demon has some random person hung in front of the two priests so they can ask their question to the thrashing gasping man Hey don t kill him or maybe That s not nice would have been more realistic then their response They never ask that they let the man go or stop in fact the closest to reacting they get is mild annoyance They ask their question and go br br I had to shut it off at that point my brain was starting to atrophy br br Avoid br br one star out of four br br
This really is the worst film I have ever seen Ever Period I actually paid 3 50 to watch this steaming turd of a movie Incredibly dull poorly acted dire script often incoherent and too many scenes that don t seem to have any relevance to the overall film like when Heath Ledger s priest partner get s nailed to a wall by a ghost what was the point in that scene answers on a postcard please br br I should have got a medal for sticking with this film for it s entire running time I would rather take a strong kick to the groin than sit through this film again br br This should be cast into IMDb s bottom 100 Hopefully my vote of 1 10 will help it on it s way
Always enjoy great films which deal with the super natural and the deep thoughts of the Spiritual world However this film just turned me off as far as its production and direction There is nothing to go into deep discussion about what this story has to tell all I can say is that it was a big waste of time and effort to put it on the big screen The actors namely Mark Addy Thomas Garrett gave an outstanding performance in his native land England and we have seen him in Still Standing a TV Series Heath Ledger played the real wicked dude and we have recently viewed him in Brokeback Mountain 05 gave a great supporting role Shannyn Sossaman Mara Sinclair did a good job of seducing a priest from a church not recognized by any faith Don t waste your time you will be sorry
First of all I have to say I have worked for blockbuster and have seen quite a few movies to the point its tough for me to find something I haven t seen Taking this into account I want everyone to know that this movie was by far the worst film ever made it made me pine for Gigli My Boss s Daughter and any other piece of junk you ve ever seen BeLyt must be out of his mind I ve only found one person who liked it and even they couldn t tell me what the movie was about If you are able to decipher this movie and are able to tell me what it was about you have to either be the writer or a fortune teller because there s any other way a person could figure this crap out br br FOR THE LOVE OF G D STAY AWAY
The Order starts in Rome where the head of a special order of priests who deal in ghosts demons named Brother Dominic Francesco Carnelutti is found dead cut to New York City where one of his order Alex Bernier Heath Ledger is contacted by top brass Cardinal Driscoll Peter Weller who ask s him to investigate the mysterious circumstances surrounding Dominic s death Along with his girlfriend Mara Willims Shannyn Sossamon fellow priest Thomas Garrett Mark Addy Alex travels to Italy to delve into his mentor s death as the truth begins to emerge it appears that Dominic was a Sin Eater someone who absorbed other s sins lived with the burden of them so they could die peacefully that the Church wasn t happy about his activities Alex must do what s right even if it goes against what he believes br br Also know under the title The Sin Eater this American German co production was written produced directed by Bian Helgeland didn t really do that much for me if I m honest I usually am honest that is Anyway lets start with the mess of a script that has some OK ideas but it s throughly predictable excruciatingly dull boring really silly at times it takes itself far too seriously The whole concept is daft while it thinks it s clever with it s oh so neat twist ending that ties everything up brings the story full circle I thought it was the most obvious lazy way to end things There s the usual religious themes here morality sin forgiveness faith belief prophecy s blah blah blah you know the sort of thing Then there s the twists which aren t hard to see coming there s the abuse of power by high ranking clergymen corruption greed evil etc you know the sort of clichéd Hollywood ideals themes that get reused every time it deals with the Church The Order has nothing new to say as a serious piece of film making it sucks a lot I m not too sure who The Order is meant to appeal to as a die hard horror fan I didn t see much horror in this at all as a thriller it s less than thrilling as a mystery it s too predictable there s nothing here to really grip or maintain ones interest for some reason I cannot figure out the IMDb also lists The Order as an action film which is absurd as it s as exciting action packed as the average episode of Sesame Street 1969 present harsh maybe but it s what I think br br Director Helgeland does an OK job the film seems to have a very soft lighting scheme it all looks a bit drab grayish dull For a supposed horror film The Order is very light on scares or horror elements in fact there aren t any of either apart from two evil kids who can turn into a flock of birds for no apparent reason don t ask Forget about any gore or violence as there isn t any which is fine but it would have helped at least make The Order somewhat watchable According the IMDb s Trivia section the release date of The Order was put back so some of the special effects could be improved because they looked unintentionally funny all I can say is judging by the finished film the effects must have been really bad to start with because they aren t exactly brilliant as it stands now br br I was amazed to see The Order had a budget of about 28 000 000 which is a hell of a lot of money I just can t see where it all went apart from the sets production design which are good The whole film looks feels very average utterly forgettable The acting is OK although the annoying fat guy who seems to be some sort of foul mouthed comic relief irritates a good actor such as Peter Weller deserves better than this br br The Order I prefer the title The Sin Eater actually not that it matters too much misses all of it s intended targets by the proverbial mile as far as I m concerned is a pretty dull way to waste 100 odd minutes of your life so don t do it Not recommended
I was not entirely impressed by this film It was originally named Sin Eater and should have stayed that way considering that is all that was talked about for the last half of the film I m not even sure what the first 20 minutes of the film had to do with any of the rest of it It was very slow and what was with picking Robocop Peter Weller as one of the main actors That was a sad point br br All in all I would say check this out if you are into things dealing with the Catholic religion but don t expect an Exorcist or Stigmata from this film It will surely flop after a few days and word gets out
OK I didn t have high expectations but this film descending into depths I could not imagine br br The plot as it were involved a priest of an obscure 2 member order investigating the death of the founder of the order by a Sin Eater The Sin Eater allows for Catholics to achive salvation outside the authority of the Church and is yet another immortal in film with loads of ennui Nevermind that this makes no sense since then a Baptist could give you salvation we ll move on br br I ll layout the plot w o giving much away the priest goes to Rome with his buddy to investogate He brings with him a mental patient I m not making this up who shot him during an excorism and who loves him not one lick of this BTW is explained a drunk Irish priest and Peter Weller as a Cardinal They get to Rome find some creepy kids who do nothing in the film meet with a bondage gear S M anti pope that the drunk Irish guy knows not explained and who gives information by killing people oh BTW he s a bad guy so he has an industrial techno soundtrack and then umm seriously I m not sure the plot meanders about Heath chills with the Sin Eater flies to New York with the Sin Eater for an overnighter and then some other stuff happens and then all off camera the anti pope falls and the film ends br br About 1 hour into the film one really wonder if anything has happened By the end something has happened but you can t be at all certain that it matters and since most of the drama takes place either before the movei or off scren you re really feeling cheated
The coming attractions to The Order make it seem like a decent horror mystery thriller but what we get is a plot that has potential to be excellent all thrown together to form a pile of garbage br br First off the whole movie consists of terrible dialogue and god awful special affects The acting was also nothing to be proud of but Keath Ledger I think I spelled that right saved the movie in this category br br For heaven s sake DON T SEE THIS MOVIE
This sorry excuse for a film reminded me a great deal of what I heard about Gigli that Ben and Jen flop earlier this Summer The Order was clearly edited to such an unconscionable degree that the scenes rather than forming a cohesive and provoking film appeared to be a collection of disconnected sequences that did little to forward any semblance of a unified plot Now I m a Heath Ledger fan 10 Things I hate About You A Knight s Tale and particularly his supporting role in Monster s Ball but my man needs to find himself a better agent Keep accepting scripts like The Order and Four Feathers and he s going to be on the fast track to movie oblivion br br Here are the problems I had with the film Firstly the Director tried to make up for the inadequacies of his essential plot by introducing two other plot lines that seemingly had little if anything to do with well much of anything Plot skeins involving the American trying to take over the Vatican and the Dark Pope while mildly interesting did nothing to reveal to the viewer anything about the main characters The attempts to tie these threads together were pathetic at best Secondly please don t insult the intelligence of the viewer by inserting into the film scenes that are clearly obligatory We had manufactured angst manufactured love and most idiotically manufactured sex that seemed like a page right out of Matrix Reloaded with skull numbing techno music Rather than developing character these elements seemed like the cheap devices they clearly were a half hearted attempt at putting popcorn chewing adolescents in the seats Thirdly and most importantly this movie seemed to ha ve an intriguing concept We have scandal we have religion and we have supernatural forces at play Why then do we learn almost nothing about anyone s background We learn a little about Alex but even he gives up the passion of the priesthood to sleep with a woman after two days a woman who tried to kill him during an exorcism at some point in the past And Alex is the most developed if you can call it that character in the entire film br br As the cliche goes nowadays if you re going to see one movie this year make sure it s not this one There s about ten interesting minutes out of the intolerable 101 minute affair The only thing that saved me was going with a girl who I m rather fond of br br 1 out of 10 I m disappointed File this one firmly under had potential but blew it on over editing and bad directing Heath my man go back to Monster s Ball like cameos They really suit you
My friends and I walked out after 15 minutes and we weren t the first Afterwards we tried to get our money back Movie theater management wouldn t allow this but they did agree to let us see another film The only time that worked for us was to see Dickie Roberts Former Child Star As you can tell this wasn t a memorable night Probably one of my worst movie nights Close second has to be when I saw a double header of Domestic Disturbance and Heist In conclusion for the sake of humanity please don t see The Order
What was the worst movie of 2003 Cat in the Hat Gigli Mais non I propose that it was this atrocious little film from earlier in the year Badly written badly edited and if I may be so bold badly acted The Order is the black hole of film a movie so dense not even the slightest bit of entertainment could escape from its event horizon of suck It isn t even accidentally funny like for example Showgirls br br You know that the producers are assuming that their audience isn t going to be very smart They renamed the movie originally titled The Sin Eaters because they figured Americans were too stupid to understand what a sin eater was even though they go to great lengths to explain what a sin eater is in the movie Instead they figure an utterly generic title and a picture of Heath Ledger looking sullen are more than enough to get you in there br br And hey what do you know they were right My ex girlfriend saw the picture of Heath and dragged me in Congratulations producers you ve met your target market She also liked Grease II so you re in good company br br Back on topic Heath plays a Catholic monk from a specific you guessed it order that is trying to investigate the murder of his mentor He has celibacy issues possibly because nobody in their right mind would believe that he knew the slightest thing about religion much less be a celibate monk The only other member of this order is a funny alcoholic fat guy As much as I ve wanted to see the return of the funny alcoholic to the big screen his attempts at humor reminded me of all the dorks in my high school who did imitations of Monty Python thinking that if they just said the lines like the Pythons did they would automatically be funny You know the sort of people I m talking about br br If I utter any more I would be in danger of generating spoilers Frankly the thing that spoiled this movie for me was the fact that it was created
I shouldn t even review this movie since it s not actually a horror movie and thus not worthy of Dr Cheese s attention At least it s not horror in the usual sense It s certainly a horrifying proposition to waste your time watching this crap That s why I turned it off after the first four hours Imagine my surprise then when the clock showed that only 45 minutes had passed Yep that s right in plain terms this movie is b o r i n g br br The Order had lots of flaws not all of them unique In particular it seems to me the main problem with the religious subgenre of horror films is Hollywood s unwillingness to engage Christianity on its own terms It is quite possible to make truly creepy films that are also orthodox Just ask William Peter Blatty In fact without orthodoxy films like this are just an anything goes smorgasbord of the filmmakers usually dull and illogical imaginations br br Think about it If someone made a movie ostensibly about say physics but not only got the basic laws of physics wrong but based the entire plot on its wrong portrayals you would soon get tired of the resulting pointless plot The same goes for these sorts of movies br br In other words The Order and many similar movies before it invent out of whole cloth stuff about the Catholic Church and about the Christian faith and attempt to build a plot out of these inventions Unsurprisingly the plot ends up being incoherent and stupid This movie has the added charm of being as interesting to watch as your toenails growing br br Avoid this steaming pile
The turgid pace of this movie numbs us to any shocks that it might provide There was no real suspense Most of the characters were insipid The chesty Irish priest was as lame as the love interest Interest is misleading The girl that they chose to provide the film s sensuality might be better The central conflict of the main character was uninvolving This film is entirely devoid of positives It is like a tedious exercise by someone who didn t want to go to the gym that day but did anyway
The good fellas at Webster s Dictionary define Logophobia as the fear of words I may just be Logophobic For no word combination scares me more than when at the beginning of a film credits contain the words Produced Written and Directed by and are followed by a single individual s name Think about it There are carpenters electricians and plumbers but so few jack of all trades Even the most seasoned of directors like Speilberg and Scorsese rarely take such control of their films But there I was all nestled in my theatre seat popcorn in hand and about to watch The Order when hurled at me like a Nolan Ryan fastball were the words Produced Written and Directed by Brian Helgeland Whoa br br Being a film buff I knew of Brian Helgeland As a writer his filmograpghy over the past 10 years would be graphed like a dotcom company s stock price in 1998 There were as many theatrical unpleasantries Assassins The Postman Conspiracy Theory as there were critical and award winning successes L A Confidential Mystic River They seemed to alternate one good one bad so knowing that his last film BloodWork was one of the most wasted efforts in Clint Eastwood s career I took a breath and hoped for the best In retrospect I should not have exhaled br br The Order stars Heath Ledger Helgeland s A Knights Tale as Alex Bernier a priest in an order known as the Carolingians who is summoned to Rome when a fellow priest is killed under circumstances that the Arch Bishop deems curious Meeting up with Father Thomas also of the Order and played wonderfully by Still Standings Mark Addy they set out to piece together the riddle left behind in the wake of the priest s untimely death br br Complicating matters is a sub plot involving Mara Sinclair played by Shannyn Sossamon who has escaped from an institution that was the result of her attempts to kill Alex during an exorcism Alex has feelings towards Mara and for some reason unbeknownst to the audience they travel to Rome together br br Nary a good nights sleep goes by and Alex is confronted by William Eden Benno Fürmann who claims to be a centuries old Sin Eater A Sin Eater as we are told are those that eat the sins of a dying individual when the church does not thus allowing entrance into Heaven William as luck would have it is tired of a life of healing and looks for Alex to take over his role and free him from his worldly duties Alex is reluctant but after the death of his new love Mara Alex resorts to the ritual of the Sin Eater to save her and the transformation is complete Alex then searches for answers to his many queries while Father Thomas unveils the Vatican plot behind the passing of authority to his fellow investigator br br The Order is not a terrible film but it is terribly boring There were ridiculous special effects and no connection with any of the characters Even in the most dramatic scene that of Alex walking in on the dying Mara is pale and bland and leaves us with no emotional response towards the couple s plight Everybody seems to talk so quietly and unemotionally that the film flat lines and smelling salts could have been administered to keep me from trying to grab a quick nap in the middle of the film br br So Mr Helgeland I plead with you not to try this again Share your vision with others and allow those more experienced to help direct you in directions that are not so narrow minded and self serving Until then there is nothing emanating that shows you are capable of anything more than a failing grade Two stars br br
Horrible waste of time bad acting plot directing This is the most boring movie EVER There are bad movies that are fun Freddy vs Jason and there are bad movies that are HORRIBLE This one fits into the latter Bottom Line don t waste your time
In the bygone days of the Catholic Church a sin eater was an individual that through ritual would take the sins of a dying person upon themselves Often these people were excommunicate or similar individuals who the church would not absolve thereby denying them entrance into Heaven The sin eaters were seen as blasphemous circumventing the chruch s monopoly on redemption Sex this up a bit with some overt supernatural mojo let the concept wander where it may and you have The Order a movie that combines Stigmata s religious anti authoritarianism The X Files paranormal investigation and The Thorn Birds sexual spirituality into an odd melange that sometimes works br br Alex Heath Ledger is a rogue priest one of the last members of the Order of the Carolingians a semi heretical order of knowledge seeking demon fighting priests When Alex s mentor is found dead under bizarre circumstances Bishop Driscoll Peter Weller sends Alex to investigate Tagging along are fellow Carolingian Thomas Mark Addy and Mara Shannyn Sossman who was subject to one of Alex s exorcisms a year prior The three go to Rome to investigate and are drawn into a dark underworld of bizarre Catholic heresy ominous prophecies demonic intrusions and a man claiming to be the last surviving Sin Eater Benno Furmann br br Written and directed by Brian Helgeland who worked with the same principals on the scattershot and half hearted A Knight s Tale the film is an odd one and difficult to classify It wants to be several things at once supernatural thriller religious intrigue dramatic television pilot and only sometimes succeeds at any of them This isn t helped by the slow pace or the fact that most of the actors seem to be sleepwalking through their performances with occasional bursts of brilliance Ledger in particular has a particularly stunning scene of despair in an otherwise monochromatic performance Sossman however displayed the same disconnected performance that she s given in all of her films most notably in The Rules Of Attraction br br The plot itself meanders back and forth between several different story arcs leading you to wonder which is the main one with each arc containing its share of red herrings Large gaps of narrative appear to be lost between scenes at times which can be confusing for many but this is also one of the film s saving graces The structure of the film coupled by the fact that there is never a truly clear antagonist until the very end of the film forces the viewer to analyze and reason in a time when most films are blatantly obvious about everything the exception to this is historical background on the Carolingians and the practice of sin eating both of which are explained in dry exposition Even at the beginning of the film character relationships and history are inferred instead of explained Combine this with the on location shooting and judicious use of special effects and you have a very old world supernatural thriller with even the opening credits reminiscent of something from the late 70 s early 80 s br br A brief mention here as well for the subtle and organic score by David Torn a combination of minimalist orchestration and Lisa Gerrard style exotic vocals A very nice score that is evocative without being bombastic and exists in a very deceptive simplicity br br A confusing plot a lack of purpose and sometimes sleepy performances would often damn a movie but for some reason The Order remains watchable Many people will be very turned off by the movie for its odd sensibilities and some may even become angry that they are forced to engage the higher functions of their brain to understand it Still the film s sheer intangibility will prevent it from being either a critical or commercial success until the DVD which I m sure will be stocked with copious amounts of deleted scenes A recommended film only for people who like to think while they watch 6 out of 10
The screenwriter poorly attempted to re create the Exorcist But put in some blah blah love story that makes you sick instead of keeping you engaged There is no substance whatsoever in this entire film It had the potential of being something special but blows it by showing a bunch of people yack about things nobody cares about Extremely boring I wanted to leave the theater when I saw this but the dumb movie tickets were expensive so I had to withstand the dreary torture which felt like it lasted forever Nothing on screen connected relevance back to whatever the characters were talking about br br They use computer graphics in here that instead of wowing me as it intended I hate CGI just ruined the movie even more Some people say this movie did horrible in the movie theaters because of how thought provoking and slow paced without action because it s an intelligent film it was What is so intelligent or thought provoking when the story is basically about pretty boy Heath Ledger as a priest who has a love interest and disobeys his religion Seems like an uninspired concept Oh and there s some mumbo jumbo about the sin eater movie was originally going to be titled sin eater Lame concept but the movie took the sin eater thing too seriously making the movie become pathetic and delusional about how dark and intelligent it was Yeah I know there were really sin eaters in the medieval times but this movie just makes it sound cheesy br br Nothing in the movie was executed right and I forget why I even bothered to see this movie If you want horror films that actually have depth watch Rosemary s Baby The Tenant Naked Blood Society Cannibal Holocaust Pin Exorcist Omen or any of the Romero Dead Trilogy films Nonsense dialogue does not equate to intelligence people mainstream movie fans think that though same kind of people that think a ridiculous movie like Hulk is a cinematic masterpiece If you want mind numbingly boring horror watch the Order This movie makes church seem like a roller coaster ride
POTENTIAL SPOILERS br br Man this movie was awful A Catholic superstitious suspense thriller it goes over already well tread ground from previous movies br br The doubting priest Sex and the priesthood Politics and religion Church hypocrisy Conspiracy involving the church The dawn of a new evil age All kinds of dark magic voodoo battles between good and evil br br Pretty stupid and lame with a weak storyline to suffice The story revolves around two concepts Absolution better known as the Sacrament of Anointing the Sick the last rights a person can ask for to cleanse one s sins while on the brink of death And Excommunication the act of cutting a person off from the Church Basically an Excommunicated person can t receive Absolution Thus comes in the Sin Eater and I ll leave it at that Throw in all the dopy things I already listed and you have The Order br br I found the sex scene with the priest interlaced with shots of a picture of the Virgin Mary rather insulting to Catholics It also ends with Heath Ledger saying I paraphrase I am the redeemer and damner of sins I live on without love blah blah blah cue him walking in dark alley with long trench coat alla The Matrix br br I gave this movie a 1 for not only being crappy and unoriginal but also because it managed to insult an entire faith in the process If you want to see something better I suggest The Prophecy with Christopher Walken
Yeah well I definitely had regrets about giving up my Saturday night watching this strange little yet very long movie Apparently neither did the main character for stealing two hours of my life Here s the epitome of the antihero in No Regrets We have this jerk so messed up so wandering so selfish aimless and unlikable that it was extremely hard to get past the attraction a highly favored businessman s up and coming son Jaemin unless it was just that physical attraction He claims otherwise that it s love But after watching this it s like loving Charles Manson because you dig the beard Alright he s not that bad but still no real redeemable characteristics I could never get past the reason Jaemin endless stalks Sumin It was never shown just told that Jaemin loves Sumin Perhaps it s a culture thing that flew over my head crazy stalking mad love over in Seoul It has to be because a little more than half the movie is one stalking the other and the last part is stalking back and forth to the point I thought this was turning into a screwball comedy I was waiting for a tiger named baby to make an appearance Okay so Sumin works two jobs while going to school so far so good on someone trying to better themselves But after his first taste of his stalker s attraction he gives up his day job for some kind of prostitution ring What OK well as previously mentioned the obsession doesn t stop due to the job career change and if you throw in a bunch of other very angry characters you get one messed up movie where unbelievable occurrences just seem to happen without buildup Basic movie not 100 terrible but you can do better with foreign gay themed movies
No one is a greater fan of Geroge Macdonald Fraser s Flashman papers than I am br br I was surprised to see just now that Richard Lester directed Royal Flash since I also see he had made the Three Four Musketeers with Fraser which I though turned out rather well br br Not so Royal Flash br br I was 12 years old when the film was released and could not have been more enthusiastic since I had read all the Flashman papers published up to that time and was intoxicated with A Clockwork Orange and Malcolm MacDowel I still am but he was never really given a chance after that br br What a disappointment I saw it once again when I was about 20 on television and it seemed even worse br br None of the sharp dialogue in the books is transfered to the screen The comedy of Flashman s character seemed to me to have been mishandled in about the same way one could imagine a group of high school students trying to parody it would do The dueling and fencing was awful and undramatic br br Looking back with more mature eyes the film failed completer to exploit the possibilities of direct satire of earlier film versions of the Prisoner of Zenda br br If you have read the book and not seen the film I can only say that the film ends with Flashman and Rudi von Starnberg becoming fast friends and playing a game Rudi has just invented Russian roulette br br A pathetic betrayal of everything the books are about br br My comments would be more direct if I had seen the film more recently but I am glad I have not br br If by any chance Fraser ever reads this I can only say I think he is a genius perhaps the greatest comic novelist of his generation but based on my appreciation of that corpus of work it as hard to believe that he wrote the screenplay of this film as that he did all those awful Roger Moore James Bond films
As an avid fan of the Flashman books by George McDonald Fraser I looked forward immensely to seeing Flashy on the big screen when this film was first released Sadly it was a huge disappointment then so I left it alone for 20 years before going back to watch it again but it was no better the second time Mr Fraser is a tremendously skillful writer but I am not a fan of his film screenplay work with Richard Lester The penchant for slapstick spoilt The Three Musketeers for me and the same applies here To me the whole tone and feel of the film is wrong The Flashman books are uproariously funny in parts but they are adventure novels There is much seriousness in the way the adventures that Flashman has after all he is involved in dangerous situations This is conveyed in the novels but not conveyed at all on film due to the its comedic style It is a tremendous shame as it could have a great film had it been a more faithful adaptation of the style of the book When I first read that the book was to be filmed the article said that the film was to star Oliver Reed I rejoiced as Reed to me was the epitome of Flashman How I would have loved to see him in the role Malcolm McDowell is a good actor but does not fit the visual image of Flashman created by the books too scrawny looking Flashman is supposed to be a big strapping fellow Neverheless Reed was excellent as Bismarck What kills the film is that it is made as a comedy The only scene in which it creates the true atmosphere of the book is the scene in which Flashman kills de Gautet Tom Bell A great shame as the production values costumes sets etc are superb and the casting is generally excellent just about everybody in the film is well cast apart from Malcolm McDowell Possibly the directorship of Richard Lester was responsible for the way the film is as a recent radio adaptation of Flash For Freedom adapted by Mr Fraser worked quite well Perhaps one day we may see Flashman done justice on screen
Raymond Burr stars as an attorney caught up in the murder of his best friend Dick Foran thanks to his affection for his friend s wife Angela Lansbury This was a full year before he started doing Perry Mason so the movie might be of particular interest to his fans if it was the inspiration for his casting br br There isn t all that much else here that s interesting though Lansbury is always good but her character here is very one dimensional and the motives for her crime in the mystery are totally obvious There s an interesting performance by Lamont Johnson as a painter who s also in love with the femme fatale but the Burr character is pretty straightforward It s frankly bizarre to see an actor like Burr doing these romantic scenes with Lansbury and his halting delivery does not match his character here very well as it does in most films I ve seen him in There s no mystery at all really and the whole suspense is supposed to be around the title of the film and the way that Burr s character is setting up the Lansbury character to implicate herself double jeopardy prevents her being tried again for the original murder presumably He does so with a very large tape recorder which she doesn t notice when she comes into the room I guess br br A few perhaps unintentionally fun moments and basically the rest of the thing could have been done for TV
This insipid mini operetta featuring a Eddy McDonald prototype in a Valentino scenario is so bad it becomes an endurance exercise after five minutes It s silly from the get go as this brevity opens two military men discussing the lack of manliness in the son of one of the officers In under a minute he is packed off to Morrocco where he lives a double life as the Red Shadow the leader of an Arab tribe that would rather sing than fight br br Alexander Gray and Bernice Clare possess fine light opera voices with little acting ability and there s a decent bass in there as well but the acting is so haphazard scenes so ill prepared you get the feeling they are making things up as they go along br br This two reeler was part of a larger stage production that lists six writers With more room to spoof and warble the show may have had some entertainment values but this rushed quickie is little more than an insult to an audience waiting for the feature presentation
I read John Everingham s story years ago in Reader s Digest and I remember thinking what a great movie it would make And it probably would have been had Michael Landon never got his hands on it As far as I m concerned Landon was one of the worst actors on earth and his artistic license went way over the top similar to his massacre of the Little House book series is proof The acting for lack of a better word is atrocious the screenplay sloppy and there are more close ups of Landon s puss than should be allowed br br This movie reflects Everingham s story as much as Little House On The Prairie reflects the books is was based on It s just another vehicle to show off Landons horrendous hair
There is so much that is wrong with this film but to sum it up Terrible acting so bad it must have been on purpose poor script they may have had some good ideas but this was not the best way to present the story ridiculously bad ending in some cases the ending manages to save the film not in this case if you manage to sit through the entire film you will want to kick yourself at the end because the ending is not even worth waiting for This is the worst film i have seen in a long time It was complete torture sitting through this film i would have appreciated someone warning me in advance So do yourself a favor Watch this film only if you have absolutely nothing better to do Even then you will regret having put yourself through the unspeakable torture
The premise of this movie was decent enough but with sub par acting it was just bland and dull br br SPOILERS The film does not work because of the nature of the death it was accidental so although it was a murder it wasn t like the guy set out to do it Also through some flashbacks there is a secret that is revealed that sort of makes the events like justice to a degree There is no emotion in this film The first 20 minutes or so is just this woman calling her sister and hearing her message It was dull and boring br br With some polishing and better acting it could have been pretty good
OK I watch a lot of bad movies I pride myself on that fact many times there are some gems in the B rated bombs But this movie is one of the worst I have watched I like a good horror movie but one with a plot of and sense of movement The opening scenes seemed pretty good Decent music and imagery Then it goes down hill from there One of the main characters has a disability Ringing in the Ears called Tinnitus Now this will in turn threaten to reveal his secret They made that too much of a focus of the movie So what he has ringing in his ears and accidentally left an ear plug somewhere where that he shouldn t have been No need to keep bringing it up So this guy is having an affair with this girl and in a motel she falls and hits her head on the end table So instead of letting everyone know of his affair he decides to dump the body Now her twin sister is trying to find out where she is and what happened to her Well after seeing her sister over and over again as a zombie like ghost and even pointing directly to the location of the body she finally finds her Now the body is recovered and she is set out to deal with the one and only suspect that killed her Bad thing is that she didn t have much of a plan Only to pretend to be her twin and met the guy where the body was dumped The idiot didn t even believe he killed her So all is revealed there and even though she had a gun somehow she manages to get herself strangled So the last scenes of the movie are of the spirits of her and her twin walking out of the water So you mean to tell me in this movie the bad guy wins And not one but two innocent people die br br Good things about the movie imagery br br Bad things about the movie music sound effects long and drawn out misdirection of plot low grade acting from some not all actors
I also saw this movie at a local screening about a year ago First I m going to say that it looks great Cassella is incredibly talented and a fantastic cinematographer I just wish the movie had been as good as it looks I would not call this a horror movie Putting in a few shots of a decaying ghost does not make it a horror movie There s no mystery there s no suspense you know who did it the entire time br br It s a drama You know what s going on with both sides the entire movie The acting was okay I guess but nothing special br br And the tagline Revenge can be deadly really they should have check how many hundreds of horror thriller movies have that exact same tagline br br It pains me to say some of this but I know a lot of the people who worked on this movie and I know they don t want people blowing smoke up their ass so I give my honest opinion
Okay at first this movie seemed pretty good even though it was moving rather quick and even though they only had a 60 000 budget it was good but if you found your sister dead in a lake and found out who might have killed her why would you go chase him around and pull a gun on him with only one bullet and waste it and end up running from him all retarded and get yourself killed Plus after you found your sister dead in the lake and found a clue and figured out who the killer was why wouldn t you hand that clue over to the police who think you killed her And at the end of the movie when she acts like her sister who was a waitress and she is talking to the bad guy she should of met him somewhere and recorded him saying she was dead and what happened for her proof I don t know I was not happy with the ending This movie could of been so much better if it lasted longer and the acting was better and if the ending did not suck so bad Do not waste your money on this movie because if you do you will be writing a review on here too and will not be happy
Just okay film about a woman who is a twin having disturbing visions of her sister in danger back at home She then returns home to find all is not well and that she is going to have to find out what happened to her sister and why br br This is the sort of thing that kind of almost works but doesn t quite I can t really put my finger on why it didn t work but it was good enough that I kind of wished it was better or at least had gotten the little things right like having the girls who play the twins in the flashbacks be closer in size I think perhaps thats whats wrong with it there are lots of little things that just are wrong
So the wife and I just finished it despite several threats from both of us to turn it off For the most part boredom was the worst part of this movie there was just very little excitement The acting was atrocious to the point where we actually chuckled several times during some of the worse scenes the church lady for example The dead sister was using paranormal means to contact her living twin although rather then send useful information she focused on trying to scare the hell out of her instead which looked a lot like The Ring Rather then get the police involved which I m sure those earplugs she found would have DNA all over them she instead devises a horrible plan to get the man who covered up the accidental death of her sister I call it a horrible plan because in the end she allows him to kill her too which the movie then fades to black Bad dialog bad acting bad ending
This movie isn t worth the film it was photographed on The dialog is flat filled with cliché overused lines and delivered by amateur actors who sound like their reading a script for the first time The choppy shaky film style is a cheap imitation of the The Ring style visual effects The characters do not even act like a normal person would For example the character who is looking for her twin sister at her home forces her way through the front door creeps around the house all frightened and sobbing and she doesn t even once call out her sister s name to see if she is home What You would think she had just buried her sister instead of searching for her Way too many flashbacks to her childhood Too many unnecessary flashbacks is a typical sign of an amateur director It is actually funny watching the numerous shots of the woman driving her car down the street up the driveway around this corner over here over there oh a side view now a front view Enough already You would think you are watching a TV commercial for the Solaris Terrible movie 0 out of 100 I really pity anybody who spent money making this film or to watch it
This was a movie about infidelity and revenge A twin with the twin connection senses that something is wrong with her sister This movie took forever to establish the plot A plot that has been done many times The acting was lousy for the most part Once the plot comes together the movie ends Laura and Ashley are twins that live with an abusive father The father seems to favor Ashley so Laura gets the blame for everything There is a promise made that the girls would never be apart but as they grow up their lives go in different directions Ashley gets a job in a diner where she meets Barry a married man Of course no good can come of this The fact that Barry had tinnitus was a poor excuse for a way to track him down I kept waiting for this movie to get better and for there to be some resolution somewhere but it never happened
For a film with so much promise it was disappointing thinly plotted and the acting ranging between horrendous and unbelievable The plot had more holes in it than swiss cheese and it s the worst clichéd ending I ve seen in a movie for some time The final scene would have ripped my heart out if the entire movie hadn t been so painful to begin with I was numb From the very first scene one was left wondering if the sister was trying to reach out to her twin for help or simply scare her to death which would have been better for the audience and saved us from two hours of the worst acting I ve seen to date It was a horror in the true sense of the word
Lolita is a rebel and she s going to share to our wide open eyes some little sex stories between sci fi and fantasy Well this Surrender Cinema production is not very good very bad acting horrifying music and a story line without any story and any line BUT the sex scenes are pretty well done lot of lesbian scenes and Jacqueline Lovell as beautiful as in The Exotic House Of Wax offer to us a very good final and very hot strip show For Lovell s fans only
Cybil Richards directs another Full Moon Surrender Cinema masterpiece of erotica This time Jacqualine Lovell dressed in rather fetching silver outfit is tasked with destroying all evidence of sexual activity However she can t resist watching the tapes and she kinda likes them The sex scenes are well filmed and set to a superb soundtrack at least for this sort of film The cast are largely awful and mainly very average looking too Jacqueline Lovell is her exceptionally attractive self and between viewing the sex files she manages to expose her chest and fumble a little down below She also fits in a little lesbian activity To be honest Lovell deserves so much better than this kind of fare Here she looks great naked but actually is much more appealing in her silver attire narrating the drama Utterly rubbish movie with Lovell and soundtrack the only real redeeming features Mediocre even for Surrender s output and clearly a new budget low for them also
I watched the movie and was dismayed to say the least that the movie failed to communicate with me as an audience The language would put to shame the street loafers br br The plot a father forcing none of his son to marry seems far fetched br br The idea of a grandmother asking her grand kid to mess up with an enemy would only draw feeble minded s attention br br and I was waiting the whole movie for a laugh and laugh I did on my stupidity to waste 3 hours to convince myself that the movie is not even worth a first look br br Hope it saves YOUR time
and even then even they can live without seeing it To be honest this film if one deigns to call it that is of real interest only to bondage freaks Bettie Page fans will learn absolutely nothing new and I do mean nothing nor will they enjoy the warm fuzzies of experiencing anything familiar loved or cherished br br Nevermind the abysmal screenplay the wooden less than community theater acting the utter absence of direction the crappy lighting or any of the rest of the bargain basement production values This is definitely Hey kids let s make a movie movie making of the lowest order I suppose one could be thankful that at least they knew how to run the camera No I m sorry to say that none of that is germane to why this thing is so outright wrong br br It s wrong because the young lady playing Bettie Page a somewhat zaftig girl whose only resemblance to the Queen of Curves is dark hair and the trademark bangs utterly fails to bring anything to the role beyond a willingness to be bound and gagged This is apparently a good thing for her film career before and since this wretched excess but not for the wretched excess itself which consists primarily of a number of lovingly re enacted B D set pieces sandwiched between horrendously awful faux biographical scenes delineating Ms Page s fall from grace so to speak There s actually probably more information per se about Page s life in the opening and closing credits than the rest of the movie br br Do not be fooled This is not a worthy companion film to The Notorious Bettie Page This is not a worthy film at all This is a fetish piece that trades on the allure of one of the greatest pin ups of all time and does it without class without style and without any real sense of understanding the character of Bettie Page whatsoever No true Bettie Page fan will find it to be anything but a disappointment I guarantee that br br Avoid at all costs If free remember that time is money too Yours may not be worth much but I m betting it s worth enough that you ll be sorry you wasted time with this one That s it I m done you ve been warned
This documentary is a reenactment of the last few years of Betty Page s Paige Richards career The Tennessee tease was the most recognizable pin up queen in history Her most memorable work came in the 1950 s and was fetish photos bondage and cat fight girly flicks Irving Klaw Dukey Flyswatter at his Movie Star News instructed Betty on what to do in front of the camera There was no nudity in the famous photos or stag films but nonetheless Klaw was charged with distributing obscene materials and was ordered to destroy them to avoid prosecution It is no surprise that Betty had a cult following at the height of her career The girl next door with jet black hair blue eyes and an hour glass figure dressed in fetish gear or not would mesmerize for decades After all it has been said that she was photographed more than Marilyn Monroe and second only to the most photographed image in the world Elvis Presley Betty Page would disappear and devote her last years to religion This movie actually could have been a lot better but good enough to hold interest br br Miss Richards is stunning in her own right Bra panties garter belt and hose do not hurt her image in the least Also in the cast Jaimie Henkin Jana Strain Emily Marilyn and Julie Simone Be advised this movie can change your heart rate
I m kinda torn on DARK ANGEL The film appears to be a loving tribute to the greatest pin up to ever live but there is so little actual content that the film itself is virtually pointless I can t really see what the motivation or point of this film is as there is very little biographical information provided in the narrative so those who don t know much about Bettie aren t gonna know much more after watching DARK ANGEL either br br The film basically chronicles the last few years of Bettie s career in bondage modeling Almost the entire film is comprised of re enactments of some of Bettie s more famous photo shoots and loops These re enactments take up literally 75 of the films run time and give virtually no insight into Bettie as a person The film touches briefly on her short lived legitimate acting pursuits and her subsequent decision to leave the business and become religious but all of this is pretty much glossed over in favor of showing long and drawn out re enactment scenes br br DARK ANGEL isn t a horrible film there s just no substance to it The other problem is that the actress that plays Bettie only really resembles her in farther away shots up close it s a no go The other thing that irritated me is that although Bettie did several topless modeling shoots the only nudity in the film was a short segment shot in a zoo during the end credits The film itself is obviously extremely low budget but does what it can set and costume wise within it s limitations so no gripes from me there The acting is pretty wooden and unmemorable from everyone involved In fact the most memorable thing about the whole film for me was noticing during the end credits that the actor who played Irving Klaw s real name is Dukey Flyswatter No joke check the cast list Can t say that I recommend this one too highly unless you are a true Bettiefile completist and must own anything relating to her And if you are that bad off then you need to seek treatment anyway 4 10
This movie was bad beyond belief I saw it during the 2004 San Francisco Film Festival Before it started the owner of the theatre got up and told us how half the audience had left the theatre the night before which happened to be its world premiere I don t think anyone in the theatre understood just how bad the movie was going to be at that point We all understood by the end br br Its not a documentary though it was sort of sold as one Dark Angel was a bad biography and misguided homage to Bettie Paige in which half the movie is actually just remakes of old Bettie Paige movies The movie is only 90 minutes long and the content of those 90 minutes is sub par to say the least A scene would start going then someone would say wow you re so great Bettie why don t we make another movie this would be followed by a 5 minutes of a Bettie Paige remake which was almost as ridiculous as and even more boring than the normal part of the movie by the end of the movie people were laughing every time another Bettie Paige movie remake came up it was that ludicrous I heard a lot of laughter in that theatre but people were not laughing with the movie maker they were laughing at the movie and its poor content and structure This was easy to tell as the parts that would get the most laughs were the ones which were supposed to be serious or revelatory br br I know movies are expensive I have seen many cheaply made independent films but somehow the cinematography and quality of this movie set it apart from anything else I have ever seen The movie looks like it was made for 12 The cuts the graininess and the lack of a sensual plot made this a memorable experience This movie makes Dude Where s My Car look like Citizen Kane br br My friends and I left the theatre feeling like we had just paid 8 dollars to be tortured The only redeeming part of the experience was that we got to laugh about the fact that someone had actually made this movie and thought it was good Apparently the previous night the night of the world premiere the director writer producer had been in the audience and had gotten to witness people laugh at and walk out on his movie Bettie Paige s movies were destroyed They should destroy this movie too
The major flaw with the film is its uninspired script It plods back and forth between vignettes of Bettie s story and re creations of the Klaw short films While the Klaw re creations are well done it is unnecessary to recreate them in their near entirety Page Richards while not an amazing actress does a decent job overall And at times she does bear a remarkable resemblance to Bettie Also of note is some faithful attention to detail Costumes and clothing well done as is some of the set direction The sets are generally sparse and feel stage y but do feel of the era It is sometimes surprisingly well lit and the color palette was clearly thought out to give the overall look a vibrant retro feel
They made me watch this in school and it was terrible The movie is outdated The episodes become confusing because fact is combined with fiction to make the story more interesting The teachers talked about it as a treat but really it was a painfully boring experience I have read that very few people who appear in this are actors but most of them them do what they do in the movie in real life This accounts for cheesy acting very often Also very often the story becomes mildly outrageous and far fetched I don t like the way some of the lines were written and wish they had more meaning to them Though it was written to be educational funny suspenseful and hip It ended up being boring dry far fetched and old I hope no one takes time to watch this movie because you would be just fine not seeing it
In sixth grade every teacher I had decided it would be a great idea to make this movie the curriculum for an entire semester Every class had something to do with this terrible show We watched it in English and wrote in journals as if we were one of the characters In math we talked about charts and other sea crap In science we talked about whales which was actually somewhat interesting so this wasn t a 100 waste of time All day everyday was torture Not only that but they would subject us to this horror twice a day by making us watch it in study hall as well I could see if this was a new series or something but it was like 93 I m still trying to block this out
I love low budget independent films and had high hopes for this one But this film is static Never mind the production value which is very noble for its budget but the pacing is deadly Admittedly these folks achieve much with little but the film fails on the most fundamental level It s boring The editing is glacial and the pacing stalls It should have been 65 minutes The best thing about the Dr Jekyll is Mr Hyde who isn t seen nearly enough He had the most dramatic potential Instead we have to suffer through dithering Baltimorean Brits stammer through endless and tiresome exposition It feels like a backwater stage play committed to video br br Noble efforts by everyone in the production but a story this tired needed a kick in the pants and funky new low budget technology should have given it a fresh voice Instead it s just a lame retread
IT IS So Sad Even though this was shot with film i think it stinks a little bit more than flicks like Blood Lake There s Nothing Out There The music they play in this is the funniest stuff i ve ever heard i like the brother and sister in this movie They both don t try very hard to sound sarcastic when they re saying stuff like My friends are going to be so jealous Hey whats with the killer only wearing his mask in the beginning Thats retarded I practically ignored the second half of this My favorite part about this movie is the sound effect they use when the killer is using the axe The same exact sound for every chop
As far as I can tell you in spite of earlier comments posted by other commentors this film IS currently available on DVD I found it only a few weeks ago br br It is on the Value DVD label and I paid the grand total of 98 cents plus tax for it I found it at a 98 cent store among racks of plastic bowls and disposable chopsticks Now don t you people who shelled out beau coup bucks for the super duper Swedish import limited edition version feel like you were had I thought so br br This film was indeed well worth 98 cents 99 cents I might start to argue with you But clearly worth 98 cents And remember that saying about getting what you pay for For slasher film mavens only
This movie is a bad to alright rip off of Friday the 13th The movie is about a killer named Bernie who kills people around a camp councilor training camp He kills people because the camp councilor training camp is on land that was owned by his father and when the police came to forcefully take his fathers land they accidentally killed his mother Another F13th take off The intro is seeing Bernie killing his first victims Then we are introduced to a family going camping in the same woods soon after they arrive they are joined by a strange old man who likes talking about his son Later we learn that his son is Bernie and that he has him locked up in the back of his caravan after having broken him out of a mental institute He sets Bernie after the family so they can take their stuff and then the chase is on br br This Movie is only recommended to those who enjoy B grade 80 s Slashers
One of the serious potential environmental costs of most mining operations is pollution of downstream streams rivers and lakes with excess sediments and toxins One of the most serious examples in 19th century USA of excess river sedimentation was caused by hydraulic mining of gold bearing gravely hills on the sides of the Sacramento Valley in the period from the 1850s to the early 1880s This process involved directing a high pressure jet of water onto the hillside causing the material to wash downhill where the gold could be separated from the gravel and sediment The sediment then collected in a ditch or stream and most found its way to the Sacramento River or its tributaries The sediment that stayed in the river bed increased the likelihood of floods in the downstream agricultural fields and towns and created permanent marshes in some areas Some of the sediment spilled over onto the agricultural fields where it might cover a standing crop or cover more desirable soil or make plowing difficult Thus the conflicting interests of the companies that used hydraulic mining and of the downstream farmers adversely affected by these operations is the subject of this nearly forgotten 1938 color film by Warner br br First we might ask why Warner decided to shoot this film in a rather poor Technicolor a very rare treatment in 1938 A story about wheat farmers and gold miners wouldn t seem to justify the expense and difficulties of color filming at this time The answer seems to be the inordinate film time spent indoors with fancy colorful clothes and ornamentations Then we might ask why colorless George Brent was chosen as the leading man and ultimate hero to be paired with Olivia de Havilland Among other things this film really needed a charismatic leading man to carry it Even the usually colorful Gabby Hayes in his small role seemed unusually subdued Unfortunately I fell asleep before the apparently more dramatic last part of the film The portion I saw spent too much time establishing a complicated set of relationships between too many people at the expense of graphically portraying the plight of the chosen wheat baron and perhaps nearby town folk and their attempts to deal with their flood and sedimentation problems It needed to be more like The Good Earth released just the year before Just maybe it would then have been suitable for a charismatic leading man such as Errol Flynn Finally there is the matter of the inane title Surely Warner could have come up with a catchy or more appropriate title Gold or Grain is short and to the point Incidentally I understand there is still plenty of gold in them thar hills waiting to be extracted by means other than hydraulic mining
As a former Kalamazoo resident with a fondness for the town I was looking forward to seeing this movie But what a disappointment Although the acting and the production values aren t bad the script is awful the plot is unrealistic and the theme is disturbing br br The main message of this film is that Women are nothing without husbands and children I can hardly believe how regressive it is in it s view of women Has the writer been living under a rock br br Although I enjoyed seeing my beloved city on the big screen I wouldn t suggest this movie to anyone It s terrible It s an embarrassment to the city it s named after
I went to see this film with low expectations but hoping to be charmed by seeing my home town on film Sadly that s about all I got The story covers familiar territory the high school reunion but the plot is convoluted and supernatural element adds little to this well worn theme Though the quality of the acting was good overall the content of the film was appalling The sexism of the film was blatant women are apparently unfulfilled unless they are married procreating or both though this was couched as a post feminist choice Worse still was the racism the shrill Jewish mother the black man who still lives at home and gratuitous cruelty tormenting the class geek We should be ashamed if these characters are thought to represent the inhabitants of the city of Kalamazoo and the writers should be abashed at having brought such broad and cruel stereotypes to the screen
By reading the box at the video store this movie looks rather amusingly disturbing You know the type funny but supposed to frighten you this was not funny or horrific the writing was lame the jokes failed to make me laugh even at their extreme mundaneness they were so expected the actors didn t even do much with such a not so good script at least I hope that wasn t their best watch this movie at your own risk I give it negative 3 stars outta 10
Pay no attention to the comments behind the curtain The majority of people leaving positive comments about this film must be receiving royalties This is a horrible film in every way Imagine high school kids with no money and no sense of humor making a slasher comedy video They would receive a D for this College kids would receive an F or asked to leave the school Since this monstrosity was made by Professionals I believe there should be jail time or at least cinema probation I enjoy watching bad movies Like Plan 9 From Outer Space but this thing doesn t even fall into that category The script acting sound and directing are so bad that it is virtually unwatchable If you enjoy watching bad films that are amusing stick with Ed Wood blaxploitation or 1970 s horror films After viewing this you get the feeling you ve wasted an hour and a half of your life
Unashamedly ambitious sci fi from Kerry Conran for whom this is clearly a labour of love Unfortunately it s just not that good It all starts well enough with an epic but restrained score a mixture of Lucas and Hitchcock style editing and the glossy cinematography of a Spielberg The movie also references many pulp sci fi novels serials and films as diverse as The Day The Earth Stood Still Superman Metropolis Planet Of The Apes The Iron Giant Star Wars and The Spy Who Loved Me The film however fails to be as good as any one of those for several reasons the main being that it s such a labour of love so concerned with throwing everything at the screen and creating a brave new world Conran actually forgets about making a movie There is little to no tension atmosphere or magic on offer here despite aerial battles dinosaurs and race against time set pieces Even the noir elements fall flat This is a broad way of looking at things though those elements mainly fail because nothing feels at all real and is so obviously fake the green screen just looks like a video game half the time and it s obvious the actors have been pasted on afterwards The actors don t get to do much either Jude Law is wooden Gwyneth Paltrow is annoying and stupid Angelina Jolie is wasted and it s all because of an awful script the sort that has to explain nearly everything It is a decent experience and some might get a nostalgia feel but ultimately this is a pointless step into the world of yesterday Nice ending though
If you are looking for eye candy you may enjoy Sky Captain Sky Captain is just a video game injected with live performers The visials are nice and interesting to look at during the entire movie Now saying that the visuals are the ONLY thing good in Sky Captain br br After ten minutes I knew I was watching one of the worse movies of all time I was hoping this movie would get better but it never achieved any degree of interest After thirty minutes the urge to walk out kept growing and growing Now I own over 2000 movies and have seen probably five times that number Yet this is only the second movie I felt like walking out of my entire life br br Acting there is none The three main performers are pitiful Jude Law also in the other movie I wanted to walk out on is just awful in the title role I would rather sit through Ben Affleck in Gigli than watch Law again br br Paltrow tries SO hard to be campy that it backfires in her face The last article I had read said that Paltrow is thinking of staying home and being a mother rather than acting After this performance I would applaud that decision br br Story Soap operas are better written The story behind Sky Captain starts out bad and gets continually worse as it progresses br br Directing none Everything was put into the special effects that story acting and directing suffer greatly Even the Phantom Menace had better acting and that is NOT saying a great deal br br I would have to give this movie a 0 out of 10 Avoid paying theatre prices and wait until video release
I saw this movie last month at a free sneak preview and I walked out It was pretty horrible In the process of trying too hard they over acted and made a horrible movie I was disappointed since I felt all the actors had made respectable choices in the past so this one couldn t be that far off the mark but I was wrong I was hoping they would give out a survey at the end of the movie so I could tell them not to release this movie I was lured in by the free aspect of the preview but it turned out to be a waste of my time and usually I m very easily amused It tried to be innovative and creative with the shots ideas and filming but because they threw together so many ideas at once it failed I m not usually picky about movies and I usually don t feel the need to display my opinions about movies but I had to warn everyone not to watch it I registered on IMDb just to tell all of you guys
In short this movie is completely worthless br br The idea is to make movie from the point of view of what someone from the early 1900s might think of the future An interesting idea but the lack of compelling story or characters prevents us from ever suspending our disbelief so the idea just flops br br Apparently the whole movie was done with actors in front of green screens and we are supposed to be impressed But as a graphics person the over softening was an obvious crutch for hiding the difficult sharp edge problem with green screening The color is majorly washed out to no relevant effect except reduce the visual quality And I don t understand why anyone would consider anything rendered in this movie to be in any way ground breaking If anything the ridiculous retrograde graphics have lowered the bar for really bad graphics they don t measure up even to the ancient Jurassic Park graphics The models for the robots were so simple plain and very uncompelling There were a bunch of weirdo prehistoric like animals on that island but they are not explained in any way br br The story is horrible beyond belief In fact I can t believe I didn t just walk out of this movie The relationship between Polly and Joe is unmotivated and throughout the movie is based on distrust and deception Why is the Morris Paley character even there We are not in any way convinced that Joe is heroic I mean he flies a plane and saved one person Polly for personal reasons Yeah there s a great hero for you Dex has very little screen time so why are we supposed to care about Joe wanting to save him Who were the Nepalease that locked Joe and Polly in the mine vault and why would they do it remembering that the entire Totenkopf operation was robotic br br Plot holes 1 Why did Bai Ling s character a major fall from her excellent character in The Crow halt the robots who had captured Joe They were looking for the vials and had not found them 2 Why in the hell would Dex be captured but not killed he doesn t have or know about the vials and the bad guys didn t know that Polly had the vials and was connected to Joe and therefore to Dex 3 Polly indicates that they don t know anything about Totenkopf yet she has some secret source about him that contains what appears to be a fairly complete FBI style file on him 4 The blank spot on the map as described by the Nepalese if they know all about this mysterious area then why the hell is their map blank in that spot 5 At one point Polly and Joe have to give up their clothes they are burned Joe is given new clothes that were identical to his old clothes yet Polly is forced to wear some very odd looking bulky dress then in the same line of continuity suddenly Polly has her original clothes back br br sigh How far off am I supposed to switch my brain to watch this crap br br We are supposed to be exhilarated by the over produced music even when nothing interesting or remotely exhilarating is happening on screen br br And the acting We re supposed to be impressed with a bunch of bad British accents Which character isn t annoying I think Ling Bai s dialogue was probably the best in the whole movie she doesn t have a single line The dialogue wasn t camp and doesn t even rise to the level of cheese Its just bad and annoying These people aren t hero s or compelling they are the kind of people you would try to ignore or disassociate with if you ever had the misfortune of meeting them in real life br br I can t believe that this movie gets an above average rating here on IMDb IMHO it should be competing with Batman Forever in the bottom 100 of all time
When robot hordes start attacking major cities who will stop the madman behind the attacks Sky Captain Jude Law plays Joe Sullivan the ace of the skyways tackling insurmountable odds along with his pesky reporter ex girlfriend Polly Perkins Gwyneth Paltrow and former flight partner Captain Franky Cook Angelina Jolie br br Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow may look and feel like an exciting movie but it really is quite dull and underwhelming The film s running time is 106 minutes yet it feels so much longer because there is no substance in this movie The visuals were great and the film did a nice job on that However there is nothing to support these wonderful visuals The film lacks a story and interesting characters making the while thing quite dull and unnecessary I blame director and writer Kerry Conran He focuses too much on the visuals and spent little time on the actual story The movie is like a girl with no personality after awhile it kind of gets bland and tiring Sky Captain represents a beautiful girl with no personality It s simply just another case of style over substance br br The acting is surprisingly average and that s not really their fault since they had very little to work with The main reason I watched this movie is because of Angelina Jolie However the advertising is quite misleading and she is only in the film for about 30 minutes Her performance is surprisingly bland as well Jude Law gives an okay performance though you would expect a lot more from him Gwyneth Paltrow was just average nothing special at all Ling Bai s performance was the only one I really liked She gives a pretty good performance as the mysterious woman and she was the only interesting character in the entire film br br The movie is not a complete bust though There were some wow and exciting scenes There just weren t enough of them The film just doesn t have that hook to really make it memorable It was actually quite bland and it wasn t very engaging at all It s too bad the film wasn t very good since it had such a promising premise In the end Sky Captain is surprisingly below average and not really worth watching Rating 4 10
I entered the theater to Sky Captain in 2004 expecting a good film Nearly every review of this movie had been positive the effects looked enticing the previews convincing br br Needless to say disappointment actually doesn t describe the feeling I got from this film It was rage br br Beyond being boring and poorly written the reason this film gets a 2 out of 10 stars is because everything in the film was stolen from another source I understand the difference between an homage and stealing this was stealing More importantly it seems that the filmmakers didn t steal to progress a point or move the plot along They stole just to show that they could There is literally no point to showing a clip of The Wizard of Oz in a theater at the beginning of the movie except to set up another scene that I won t elaborate on which steals from the same film Needless to say every concept in the film was neither original nor even a spin on an old concept it was literally just a rehash of something I had already seen from pulp era robots reminiscent of the old Superman Cartoons and the recent film The Iron Giant to the silent martial artist minion of the villain that has been used in countless films most recognizable in recent years as Darth Maul in Star Wars The Phantom Menace br br On the subject of the actual film most of the performances were completely wooden Perhaps this is because the entire movie was done on a blue screen with computer imagery filling in everything save the actors Frankly this is no excuse for poor acting If a person was ever a child they understand that a lack of visual reference is no excuse for not trying br br Finally there is no humanity in this film The protagonists are the only real human beings here Nearly all the antagonists are robots and the number of friendly characters that are shown during the film can be counted on one hand If robots are attacking the entire planet shouldn t we expect to see masses of humanity running from them The sub par performance of the main characters prevents us from connecting to really anything here br br The film wasn t the worst movie out there which is why I didn t give it a 1 Rather the film was an example of all that is wrong with modern action films the filmmakers tried to justify the movie with special effects but without artistic vision or originality of any kind it falls flat
The exploding zeppelins crashing down upon Sky Captain Jude Law s base present an adequate metaphor to describe how truly terrible this movie is First off let me state right off the bat that I sincerely doubt that Paramount will ever recover any money from this film A cult hit it might become but only because it is so remarkable for what it failed to achieve I can see the studio pitch now Let s combine 1920 s German Expressionism and a 1940 s globetrotting adventure with a modern action flick and use computer animation to dominate every scene Wow won t that be a success Skycaptain bludgeons the viewer with its sheer excess There are too many fake explosions too many unconvincing dogfight scenes and too few real moments where the characters are anything but painfully two dimensional After all why shock and awe with one floating airship when you can have three or five or one hundred Moreover what could have been a groundbreaking film seamlessly combining computer generated imagery and human actors in a stylized and intriguing setting will instead become a flop in no small part because it fails to meet the most important requirement of any flick using CGI Quite simply the graphics are amazingly poor From the movement of the cars to the physics of the aircraft in the dogfights everything seems to be just a little off I m not being nit picky here in any way An infant could notice that a car doesn t glide along the road like a maglev train unless its a Mercedes S500 And for those of you raising your voices in protest crying out This is a stylized film it s not supposed to be like reality let me just say this Lord of the Rings has set the standard for integrating real life actors with CGI Starship Troopers has set the standard for ironic science fiction films the Rocketeer did a solid job reintroducing the decade of the 1920 s back into the Hollywood film portfolio and Tim Burton s Batman created a unique picture of New York City Gotham that has yet to be repeated Sky Captain falls so short of all these films it is hard for me to mention them in the same sentence Plus the acting is so poor it makes me positively ill So there you have it I spent 9 to see this film and you get my review I hope it might dissuade you all from making the same mistake that I did
This movie was way over hyped A lot of the viewers who thought this was amazing must have been into the old school movies cause the whole movie is set in the past At first I thought the movie was just showing something from the past so I was expecting that faded dreamy like lighting on the characters to pass but it just going Basically this was a movie trying to mix the future with the past and the 2 don t mix very well in this movie even with special effects You could actually see the blue screen the actors were working with There are too many movies out there that do exactly what this movie did so there is no reason for critics to hype this movie up saying it s the greatest movie ever done It s just crap on a stick It also didn t help that the story line was sooo crappy I don t understand why Hollywood agreed to have this movie produced and I also don t understand how actors actresses in this movie are willing to be in a movie like this It s almost as though everybody read the script and forgot to read the fine print It will all be done on a computer This was a movie that should have been on a movie network because nothing about this movie was revolutionary I m very upset with myself for paying money to see this Whatever you do don t waste your time and money on this movie today or tomorrow
A gave it a 2 instead of a 1 awful because there is no denying that many of the visuals were stunning a lot of talent went into the special effects and artwork But that wasn t enough to save it br br The sepia toned washed out colors sort of thing has been done before many times in other movies Nothing new there I can see there were some hat tips to other old classic movies OK No problem with that br br But a movie has got to be entertaining and interesting not something that would put you to sleep br br The story line and the script of this movie WAS awful the characters two dimensional Slow moving Some of the scenes were pretty to look at but ultimately as a whole it was quite boring I couldn t recommend it
Visually stunning Most definitely I have seen few films look this good in some time Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow uses striking cinematography computer graphics and creative futuristic designs to create a world that is historically familiar yet something quite fresh The time period seems to be the 1930s or early 40s The movie tells of recent attacks on New York City by mechanized armies stealing generators and the like for some inexplicable reason Also mysterious disappearances of relevant scientific minds coincide Who can stop them and save the world Alright it doesn t take a leap of faith to know it is the Sky Captain himself with his wisecracking reporter girlfriend always hot for a lead and in the wings his trusty thoroughly competent sidekick What Sky Captain has in atmosphere and graphics it lacks in storytelling and characterization The plot for this film is ridiculous That being said the film is going for a serial like feeling of film serials of yesteryear They had pretty far out stories and bad acting but none of them and I mean none of them had the budget and big names this film had Two academy award winning performers and Jude Law could keep a film afloat one would think but Sky Captain sinks miserably Despite its fantastic dark look I found myself wishing the film would just end and I could get on with my life I had little interest in a story that generated little interest I didn t care at all for any of the glib portrayals Paltrow was just awful Jolie was a joke with a role with virtually no substance Law cannot carry the one liner tradition all too squarely on his limited shoulders I mean let s face it he s not Will Smith Mel Gibson or even Wesley Snipes The sad thing about Sky Captain at least for me was that it held so much promise yet delivered so little I was bored ten minutes into the film waiting for something to hook my interest and it never came
I like the time period I like the attempt but watching a movie that looks like I m looking at it through a coke bottle gives me a headache If I played computer games that were this blurry and out of focus I would upgrade my computer Could be that this was the look the director was after but not so it hurts the eyes and you want to leave after 10 minutes If I hadn t taken someone with me to this film I was out of there Even though it was a series and not a movie per say Band of Brothers accomplished this They made it look like WWII footage with just a touch of graininess but it was still a pleasure to watch Movies need real people with real sets and real locations Use CGI when it is appropriate not for an entire film
Sky Captain is possibly the best awful movie I ve seen in a long while Rife with amazing CG and special effects studded with an A list cast Jude Law Gwyneth Paltrow Angelina Jolie and the infinitely likable Giovanni Ribisi and racing along with an overused but Indiana Jones esquire storyline this should have been a great movie to watch br br Should have being the key term here of course br br Jude Law plays Joe the Sky Captain with a dashing accent and plenty of over the shoulder heart melting smirks but you can t make something out of nothing and even his flippant deliveries and boyish good looks can t save the movie s stone dialogue If he had slapped Giovanni Ribisi on the back and said Good boy Dex just ONE more time I might have barfed all over the guy in front of me Gwyneth Paltrow as Polly Perkins is nothing less than nerve grating Her nasal whining and not quite sarcastic comments get old in the first ten minutes of the movie Perhaps she put too much effort into playing the stereotypical 30 s comic book heroine who knows I expected more from her An example of how a similar character was played and played well is in the late 90 s flick The Phantom starring Kristy Swanson and Billy Zane Rent the movie and you ll know what I mean br br Giovanni Ribisi and Angelina Jolie were the saving graces in the film Angelina Jolie was incredibly hot in that eyepatch I ll admit it In just a few short scenes both actors somehow managed to rise above the tired material and deliver a more riveting performance than their dry two dimensional castmates br br The plot and steady story progression were old boring and basically just a monotonous combination of every good scene from an action movie in the past thirty years The pace is rapid fire in the first half of the movie and a snail s pace in the second giving the audience enough time not only to guess the eventual conclusion of the film but to figure out who the key villain is as well The pairing is rather clichéd also Polly Perkins and Sky Captain apparently reunite after several years of separation from a bitterly ended romance and their story isn t so much charming and eclectic as it is annoying and mismatched When they finally come to terms with their mutual feelings towards the end of the film nobody s surprised and nobody really cares either br br Props to the director for appreciating Bai Ling enough to dress her in skintight vinyl for the entirety of the film and also for the intriguing sepia tones that served as coloration throughout But Sky Captain despite having all the essential elements of being a great movie falls flat on its face Not even worth the 2 75 I paid to get into the theater
Sky Captain may be considered an homage to comic books pulp adventures and movie serials but it contains little of the magic of some of the best from those genres One contributor says that enjoyment of the film depends on whether or not one recognizes the films influences I don t think this is at all true One s expectations of the films fiction and serials that Captain pays tribute to were entirely different Especially so for those who experienced those entertainments when they were children This film is almost completely devoid of the charm and magnetic attraction of those Of course we know the leads will get into and out of scrapes but there has to be some tension and drama Toward the climax of Captain Law and Paltrow have ten minutes to prevent catastrophe and by the time they get down to five minutes they are walking not running toward their goal They take time out for long looks and unnecessary conversation and the contemplation of a fallen foe with 30 seconds left to tragedy Of course one expects certain conventions to be included but a good director would have kept up some sense of urgency br br One doesn t expect films like this to necessarily make sense One does expect them to be fun thrilling and to have some sense of interior logic Captain has almost none Remember when Law and Paltrow are being pursued by the winged creatures and they reach a huge chasm which they cross via a log bridge Well how come they are perfectly safe from those creatures when they reach the other side They can FLY The chasm itself means nothing to them The bridge is unnecessary for them so where is the escape If the land across the chasm is forbidden to the flying creatures the film made no effort to let us know how or why or even if br br I know that Paltrow and Law both of whom have given fine performances in the past were playing types but both were pretty flat Only Giovanni Ribisi who showed himself capable of great nuance here and Angelina Jolie seemed to give any oomph to their roles although Omid Djalili seemed like he could have handled a little more if he d only been given the chance He did a pretty good job anyway considering how he was basically wasted br br The film had a great look but there are so many ways in which CGI distracts CGI works best when it is used for the fantastical when it is used to create creatures who don t exist in nature or for scientific or magical spectacular When it is used to substitute for natural locations it disappoints There is no real sense of wonder A CGI mountain doesn t have any of the stateliness or sense of awe and foreboding that a real mountain does I know that the design of this film was quite deliberate and it wasn t necessarily supposed to LOOK real but shouldn t it FEEL that way It just didn t br br As for the weak and clichéd script homage is no excuse Even so had the movie had some thrills and dramatic tension it might still have been enjoyable The Last Samurai was as predictable as the days of the week and I am no fan of Tom Cruise but it had everything that Captain didn t most notably it drew the viewer into its world and made us accept its rules and way of being in a way that Sky Captain most definitely did not br br I d like to see a similar approach taken for films about comic book heroes of the 30 s and 40 s The original Jay Garrick Flash or Green Lantern Alan Scott come to mind as being ripe for such treatment Maybe the better more well known and fully realized characters that those character are would make for a much better film It would be hard to be worse
Visually interesting but falls flat in the originality department This tedious excercise in technique wears thin after the opening battle Jude Law has the charisma of burnt toast but in his defense this film contains some of the worst dialogue I have ever seen on the big screen In fact the script is so poor that it keeps taking you out of the film and had me thinking about work bills my dogs etc There are many moments that scream bluescreen Paltrow is as wooden as they get This could of been saved by snappy film noir dialogue or over the top camp My only complaint on the technique is that Black White film sorry computer would of helped because it looks like Turner colorized black and white Just a big dull cliché mess I would rather break my femur than sit through this endurance test again
Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow an amazingly incovenient title is simply a bad movie it has no heart no deep ideas nothing very special about it Yes the CGI backgrounds look interesting but the result is that the whole thing is shot in an annoying soft focus Additionally the movie uses music the same way as say Gilligan s Island or the Scooby Doo cartoons IT NEVER STOPS Terribly simply terrible There are no fresh ideas either just gobs and gobs and gobs and etc of bits taken from older movies and serials There is no gatekeeper here the movie just seems to exist because it can Save your money and your time Not entertaining at all
In a word this film was boring It lacked life and spark A big problem is with the two leads Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow had no chemistry whatsoever He was boring and she was annoying br br The visuals were interesting but they didn t enhance the scenes If anything the visuals tended to detach the audience from what was happening on screen None of the action sequences felt real and hence the film failed to create any real drama or a sense of danger br br The film had potential but it needed a better script better acting and a better director I kept thinking during the film you know this movie would ve worked if Harrison Ford was Sky Captain Karen Allen was Polly and Steven Spielberg was the director br br Ignore the critical acclaims for this film The critics I think are praising the film because they want to like it and want it to succeed even though it fails on so many different levels
What a waste of time I ve tried to sit through Sky Captain about 6 times and every time within about 3 minutes I start doing something else anything else It s a downright boring movie the acting is terrible the writing dull and obviously a first time director because it s stiff And I wanted to love it I love sci fi the old cliffhangers and I can appreciate the attempt at nods to Flash Gordon and Metropolis but my God what a waste of money I used to work for Paramount Pictures and I had written Sherry Lansing in 1993 about using blue screen for screen tests She told me they d never have an interest or need to do it 10 years later Paramount releases this piece of crap Sherry was right in 1993 but must have forgotten her own advice when she greenlighted this dog Blue screen an effect shot but not an entire movie Let s not forget neither Jude nor Jolie are terrific actors but easy on the eyes Paltrow s performance reminds me of a high school effort Too bad it could ve worked but only under a skilled director the funny thing is Sky Captain s director will keep getting work even after this dreck It s commerce not art
This movie feels so EMPTY IN every scene in the movie the maximum number of actors on the screen is like 10 Because everything was shot in front of a blue screen there are never really any extras and the movie just feels weird br br The ACTING was HORRIBLE It s so obvious this was in front of a blue screen because all of the action scenes you can see the actor actress wondering around half running when they should be running for their lives Looking at the floor for their marks br br Spoilers Also you ll find yourself banging your head watching the movie At one point at Sky Captain s home base they have like 100 planes sitting on the airstrip They have advanced warning an attack is coming So what do they do nothing All of the planes get blown up and yet again the ONLY person fighting back is the Sky Captain br br THE ENTIRE world is under attack and he s the ONLY person ever fighting back At the very end of the movie you see hundreds of plains taking off finally but what do they do Nothing the movie is over
I ve said this in other reviews without a story you can give the audience all the smoke and mirrors you want still no one will give a damn br br The director seems to have a great eye for 30s art deco which I love and I think the idea of using all digital backgrounds and such could indeed be the wave of the future in movie making However it s obvious the director got so interested in the digital rendering of his movie he forgot to film many scenes which would have enormously helped this surprisingly thinned plotted film SPOILER For crying out loud they forgot to have a villain in this thing OK they have one but he s been dead for 20 years by the time the movie takes place Conran misses the point of HAVING a villain As far as action goes well let s see Sky Captain Law shoots down ONE robot two or three of the flapping wing airplanes before Dex Ribisi tells him to stop shooting them down and a couple robots but mostly spends his time looking dashing and getting others to fight his battles for him Paltrow as Polly or Peggy or Punky or whatever is totally wasted in this movie the reviewer who comments on hers and Law s lack of chemistry is so right and I for one got a little sick of seeing repeated shots of the top of her camera showing she ONLY HAS TWO SHOTS LEFT both of which she wastes subsequently in the movie one uncomically one quite funny although I saw it coming from 70 years away No one except Law and Paltrow have any significant time on screen and that s the movie s real flaw An audience doesn t identify with robots they need a hero to root for and a visible despicable villain to hate Without that plus a good engaging story all the CG in the world won t help
I gave 1 to this film I can t understand how Ettore Scola one of the greater directors of Italian cinema made a film like this so stupid and ridiculous All the stories of the people involved in the movie are unsubstantial boring and not interesting Too long too boring The only things I save in this movie are Giancarlo Giannini and Vittorio Gasmann Hope that Scola will change radically themes and style in his next film
This movie should be called plan 9 from joseph smith i think its weirdness is underappreciated the playwright seems to have read paul ehrlich s the population bomb 1968 and crafted a musical response made especially for mormons the whole point of the play is that having as many children as you can is part of heavenly father s god s plan and anything that stands in the way of having more babies is very bad get it br br This version was filmed in 1989 which is confusing it s utah so it looks and feels like 1983 the play was actually written in 1973 and of course the theology is part 1840 s part battlestar galactica some of the action takes place on earth and some in the pre existence an aimless romper room where annoying kids wait to get their bodies so they can come down try not to slam the door on the missionaries losing their shot at celestial glory br br it is as stagey as they come but don t let the poor theatrics spoil your appreciation for this demented mormon universe where the cool kids are all into population control presumably counseling their parents not to have any more children having big families was at the time the play was written the cultural norm in the lds community and more importantly considered part of God s plan the church has since done a 180 and have made family planning a choice of the parents and large families are much less the cultural norm now making the entire doctrinal premise of the movie for a modern day mormon moot br br ahhh but it s really only as good as the music there are some catchy tunes here that just won t let this movie die the 1970 s death it was pre destined for the brother and sister sing some love songs to each other that make you wonder if maybe something else was going on there wink and the tough cool kids make new kids on the block look like metallica so cheers to all that gather the family around make some jell o shooters and enjoy the show br br
To start with I have to point out the fact that you re gonna feel completely lost for more than half an hour Yeah some things happen but you don t know why or what for When you finally figure things out you just realize that it s nothing but a twisted soad opera dealing with mature prostitutes dead mothers illegitimate sons The characters are rather poor and the actors specially the young ones don t help that much to make em look credible Only Marisa Paredes stands out but she s a superb actress no matter if the movie is pure rubbish br br The only positive things to say about Frío Sol De Invierno is that débutant Pablo Malo seems to have good intentions and he s filmed a couple of scenes that are quite intense Well maybe the next time br br My rate 4 10
Adrian has just gone out of the asylum being rich and with no parents his life seems empty One day he meets Gonzalo a poor boy whom mother is prostitute Desperate for earning some money Gonzalo helps Adrian to search about his life and who where his parents This is a movie from a new director and it is perfectly clear in most of the film scenes not correctly directed dialogues a little forced some incoherences in the script Anyway the ending is unexpectedly well done well just a little and that saves a little the film Actors are known and with great quality nevertheless they are not inspired enough to make the movie interesting all of them have done better papers in other film The film results boring and probably you will spend most of the time thinking how much time will pass until it ends Of course there are lots of worse films but sure there are many many better ones
For shame for shame that a fine actor such as Joseph Fiennes would allow himself to be cast in this piece of nauseating drivel The movie was not only bad but down right horrible and of no redeeming quality The plot was there one seemed to go no where The Russians played silly kill or be killed games and the rest of the cast should be declared null and void for their pathetic performances I gave up about 3 4 of the way through and turned it off A 1 for awful only because there is nothing lower Don t waste your time on this one you ll not miss anything
I have not yet decided whether this will replace Anaconda as The Worst Film I Have Ever Seen br br Even if you ignore the dodgy accents low production values and appalling camera work this film has absolutely nothing going for it I only went to see it as I had read the book and wanted to see how they would work the complicated plot into a 2 hour film br br The simple answer is they didn t Characters appear with little to no explanation as to who they are and then proceed to play no valuable part in the narrative Even the main characters act without reason so that by the time the film reaches it s climax you don t care what happens to any of them br br I can accept that books occasionally need to be rewritten to fit into films and that it is perhaps unfair to judge this film against the book it was adapted from But after my friends and I came out of the cinema I had to spend most of the journey home explaining what was supposed to have happened br br They even change the true meaning of the books title Rancid Aluminium by squeezing it into yet another piece of pointless voice over just so they can allow the film to have a cool title br br A real mess of a film from start to finish
There have been some low moments in my life when I have been bewildered and depressed Sitting through Rancid Aluminium was one of these br br The warning signs were there No premiere even the stars didn t want to attend and no reviews in magazines The only reason I sat through the film was in the hope that I might catch up on some sleep br br Nothing in the film was explained The narration was idiotic I cheered at one point when the lead of the film appeared to have been shot then to my growing despair it was revealed that he hadn t really been shot dampening my joy I sincerely hope all involved in the film are hanged for this atrocity br br There were some positive aspects mainly unintentional moments of humour For example the scene in which the main character for some unknown reason feels the need to relieve himself manually in a toilet cubicle while telling the person in the next cubicle to put his fingers in his ears br br My words cannot explain the anger I feel so I shall conclude thus br br Rancid Aluminium for sadists wastrels and regressives only who want to torture themselves
Well what to say br br Having seen the film I still have to wonder what the hell the point of it all really was V Dodgy camera moves in the courtyard at one point I had to look away from the screen I was feeling physically sick Round and Round and Round You get the idea br br VERY VERY Strange accents at many points Those that should know know br br Unless your getting in for free or being paid to watch it or your partner is about to make you paint the house or something then forget it
Okay So there aren t really that many great movies around Recent gems like American Dream The Straight Story and even Toy Story 2 don t normally come so close together But boy does this film counter balance the quality br br I have NO idea what these people thought they were doing Are the financiers in this world so easily convinced to fund such a crock of I can just see it now br br Producer So we ve got Joe Fiennes He s cute as a button and was pretty good in Shakespeare in Love And we ve got Rhys Ifans who isn t cute but was cool in Notting Hill We ll mix in a really mediocre score a few forgettable post Britpop tunes hemlock root and lizard brains and hey presto you ve got the worst film of the new millennium And believe me it s gonna be a hard job to make anything as bad as this in the next thousand years br br The Bank I like it Any unnecessary sex Bad camera movements And what about the worst accents this side of Devil s Own br br Producer Yeah we got plenty of those br br The Bank Sounds great where do we sign br br Please
I was hoping that this film was going to be at least watchable The plot was weak to say the least I was expecting a lot more considering the cast line up I wonder if any of them will include this on their CVs At least I didn t pay to rent it The best part of the film is definitely Dani Behr but the rest of the film is complete and utter PANTS
Must confess to having seen a few howlers in my time but this one is up there with the worst of them Plot troubling to follow Sex and violence thrown in to disorient and distract from the really poorly put together film br br I can only imagine that the cast will look back on the end product and wish it to gather dust on a shelf not to be disturbed for a generation or two Sadly in my case I have the DVD It will sit on the shelf and look at me from time to time
I have seen bad films but this took the p Made no sense and all the characters do is swear every couple of seconds oh and i think one has a low sperm count Its that good A welshman plays a sweary cockney A posh english bloke plays a foul mouthed unlovable rogue of a paddy and some lesser lights play dim tarts br br And there are some Russian gangsters Oh yes some one has a gun and maybe talks rubbish whilst high on drugs br br Avoid this film like the plague
We know from other movies that the actors are good but they cannot save the movie A waste of time The premise was not too bad But one workable idea interaction between real bussinessmen and Russian mafia is not followed by an intelligent script
the first film I had to walk out on And it was the cast and crew pre screening Not that I was involved I hasten to add I made it through the first hour so I reckon I m just qualified to comment but that was my limit br br Like other comments here how did this get through any kind of QA An accumulation of the very worst in dialogue the epitome of wooden acting awful casting all wrapped together without a plot br br Tara Fitzgerald s casting was bizarre almost comic She possesses the worst Russian accent in movie history br br As I left the screening the director and producers were drinking in a bar outside the cinema They obviously couldn t sit through it again either br br
How can you gather this respectable cast of young British actors and come up with such a pile of filmic manure Horrible script annoyingly hectic camera awfully edited gruesomely badly acted Only Rhys Ifans tries to fill his role with life Another painful proof that different sometimes equals dreck Why do the money people fail to read the scripts beforehand Do yourself a favour spare yourself and do something else like hitting a mallet onto your knees It s less painful and more fun than this movie
Just so that you fellow movie fans get the point about this film I decided to write another review I missed a few things out last time br br First the script Second the acting Third Jesus Christ what were they thinking making a piece of garbage like this and then expecting us to enjoy it when there are no redeeming features whatsoever from beginning to end except when Joseph Fiennes finally gets blown away in a very unexciting climax br br I can t believe I wasted my money on this when I could have given it to a homeless person or a busker or SOMETHING br br Are you getting the picture
This is a truly abysmal LOCK STOCK clone with a stellar cast and a terrible script I have no idea why so many top British actors signed up to this junk they must have been bribed A miss match of a storyline goes on forever and ever and ever and if I hadn t have paid good money for it I d have turned it off after 10 minutes Not the worst film ive ever seen that honour goes to the truly pathetic used bogroll of a movie I use the term loosely GUMMO I feel like suing that so called director for the lost hour and a half of my life but this trash is nearly right down there with it Definitely one of the worst 5 films I have ever seen Stuff like this reminds Hollywood that they don t have a monopoly on truly awful films
I shall not waste my time writing anything much further about how every aspect of this film is indescribably bad That has been done in great detail already many times over The plot started out as a very uninspiring cockney wide boy gangster by numbers bore and very quickly descended into an utter shambles Anybody who pretends that they can see some hidden masterpiece inside this awful mess is just kidding themselves It is now 7 or 8 years since I watched it during its 1 week run at the cinema before it was pulled yet it sticks in my mind for being easily the most terrible film I have ever seen br br I am only making these comments and indeed the only reason I went to see the film is because of the amusing fact that my brother Eddie appeared in it as the second heavy in the pub scene It was his hands that thrust a zippo lighter towards Rhys Ifan s face in the bar in Russia it was actually filmed at the former Butlins holiday camp at Barry Island My brother has absolutely no acting experience whatsoever he had recently joined an extras agency and this was his first part Having seen the film it appeared that nobody in it required any acting experience whatsoever br br I remember there were about 8 people in the whole cinema and this was just a couple of days after it had been released I have never heard of an other film that was so unpopular and disappeared so fast and rightly so In case you were thinking of renting this film on DVD I would advise you instead to put your two pound coins in a fire until they are red hot then jam them into your eye sockets This will probably be a lot less painful than watching the film
There is no doubt that this film has an impressive cast but unfortunately this doesn t help with the major downsides to the movie I never understand why directors ask actors actresses to use accents not their own when it is obvious to everyone they can t convince Fiennes just can t do Irish and Fitzgerald isn t much better at Russian When the voice is wrong then no matter how good the acting the character will never be convincing As the for the major problem the plot was there one I guess there was some sort of storyline involved but it was so full of holes that I just couldn t wait for the film to end it was ridiculous Save 90 minutes of your life and don t watch this movie
this film is quite simply one of the worst films ever made and is a damning indictment on not only the British film industry but the talentless hacks at work today Not only did the film get mainstream distribution it also features a good cast of British actors so what went wrong i don t know and simply i don t care enough to engage with the debate because the film was so terrible it deserves no thought at all be warned and stay the hell away from this rubbish but apparently i need to write ten lines of text in this review so i might as well detail the plot A nob of a man is setup by his evil friend and co worker out of his father s company and thus leads to an encounter with the Russian mafia and dodgy accents and stupid very stupid plot twists devices i should have asked for my money back but was perhaps still in shock from the experience if you want a good crime film watch the usual suspects or the godfather what about lock stock thats the peak of the contemporary British crime film
Words really can t describe how bad this film is I thought Zandalee was bad but at least that had some nice shots and the occasional good chin stroking moment here and there to stop you from nodding off This is just laughable Terrible script poor direction awful acting and you know what I can t think of a single thing to recommend about it other than the fact that it isn t too long If you want 100 minutes worth of entertainment book yourself in at the dentist and have some root canal work far more enjoyable and much better value for money assuming that you need it Incidentally I need to type 10 lines of text to complete this review PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE IT IS TERRIBLE
This film is about a man s life going wrong His business is failing and he cannot impregnate his wife despite multiple attempts br br The plot is complete chaos It simply does not make sense In fact nothing in the film makes sense The story is so poorly told that I simply could not understand it It is a shame because the sets and costumes are done well and are visually stimulating enough The shots are well composed throughout the film However these redeeming features still cannot make up for the bad plot and poor story telling I am amazed by the big names who agreed to star in this film It is such a waste of their talents This film is very bad Avoid it
I have given this film an elevated rating of 2 stars as I personally appear in minutes 42 and 43 of the film the road side bar scene in Russia In this scene the director of the movie offered me the immortal line 50 Dollars you Drink and Talk but I felt that my Polish counterpart could speak in a more convincing Russian accent than I could so I declined to take this speaking part on I was slightly starstruck as this was my first Film experience and who knows these lines could have ended up there with lines such as I ll be Back and Quite Frankly My Dear I Don t Give a Damn Had I spoken that one line then my name would appear in the credits of Rancid Aluminium as Heavy 1 instead of the name of Ryszard Janikowski br br As time goes on I am counting myself lucky that my name is in no way connected to this film br br Even though I spent a whole day on the set in South Wales hot spot Barry Island no one could tell me what the actual storyline was The caterers and the wardrobe lady all concurred that it appeared to have a lot of swearing and nudity in it things could certainly have been worse if I d ended up naked in this most dreadful of films br br Still On the positive side I got chatting to Rhys Ifans during one break I had no idea who he was as Notting Hill was yet to be released and not an inkling that he might be Welsh Made various inappropriate comments about what an awful pit Barry Island had become since my childhood visits there in the 70s and 80s It was only when Keith Allen showed up that I realised I was in a quality production
In the wake of Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels the British film industry rapidly became swamped with bad gangster films in the late 90s early 00s that seem even more desperate today than they did then In one of the all time great cases of pearls from swine the producers of Rancid Aluminium brazenly plastered the quote The best film of the century from one review all over the ads while omitting the rest of the sentence pointing out that that was only because at the time of writing it was the only film that had been released in 2000 Looking at it today it s hard to imagine how it ever got made uniting a cast that was briefly considered the cream of Cool Britannia s Lads Mags Brigade Rhys Ifans Sadie Frost Nick Moran and Joseph Fiennes but now merely a guarantee of a turkey every time in a confused adaptation of a confused James Hawes novel That the plot is never explained could be down to the possibility that no one really knows what it is or perhaps simply don t think it matters Something to do with Ifans businessman being set up with Steven Berkoff s homicidal Russian crime lord in a money laundering or investment scheme it s never clear which because no one ever asks by Fiennes crooked Irish accountant who expects the Russians to kill off Ifans so he can take over his failing company Things get increasingly confused and underexplained from there on Ifans alternates between shouting about how terrible his life is while juggling visits to the fertility clinic and sleeping with his secretary and Tara Fitzgerald s ludicrously accented Russian temptress Berkoff keeps on saying Bizniss and Francis Drake and Fiennes does a decent Irish accent while proving that just because he played a great writer in Shakespeare in Love doesn t mean he s any judge of good writing when it comes to film scripts br br When the most convincing performances come from Keith Allen and Dani Behr you know a film is in deep trouble With Poland standing in for a Russia filled with people with Polish accents and a strange score that veers from John Barry pastiche to lounge music to Ennio Morricone spaghetti Western on a stylophone budget it fails completely in the cool stakes it s aiming for and ends up in a curious overplotted but almost plot less limbo all its own sitting there like a joke shop dog turd
I felt Rancid Aluminium was a complete waste of two hours the plot line was thin and confusing the prestigious line up of players had some terrible dialogue and extremely questionable accents The camera work was somewhat experimental in places and although it could be seen what the director was trying to convey it just made it even more difficult to watch One of the most annoying aspects of Rancid Aluminium is the over use of narration throughout the film almost like the entire plot is being dictated to the audience The best performances weren t anything to do with acting In fact probably the most convincing performance came from Dani Behr of all people although admittedly does play the stereotypical office secretary DO NOT under any circumstance go and see this movie unless you need a reason to catch up on some lost sleep there are certainly better ways to spend your hard earned cash
I usually try to construct reasonably well argued critiques of films but I can not believe this got past the script stage The dialogue is appalling the acting very dodgy the accents just awful and the direction and pacing is scrappy at best br br I don t remember the last time I saw a film quite this bad Joseph Fiennes pretty as he is might just have killed his career as quickly as it started br br The Island of Doctor Moreau was no worse than this garbage
I read James Hawes book It was pretty neat not great but entertaining enough Without having read the book I wouldn t have had the slightest idea what was going on and it was still a stretch with that knowledge br br Literally every element of this film is abysmal in ways I do not have the capacity to describe Half digested fish could have made a better film with matchsticks and dayglo lipstick br br Never before or since as a film made me feel so angry The Mattress sequels came closest but even they never reached such depths of utterly putrid nauseating appallingness that this bilge did br br Since wasting 90 minutes of my life witnessing this plague on human kind I am now unable to even look at any book by James Hawes without feeling angry That is the depth of hatred I have for this piece of sh t No that s unfair Let me apologise to all fecal matter for comparing you to the otherworldly evil that is Rancid Aluminium br br Plain and simply a cancer on the world of cinema
Where do you begin with a movie as bad as this br br Do you mention the cast of unlikeable heroes The over the top acting The dreadful script br br No You just say that anyone who pays money to see a film as poor as this needs their head looking at I know I do I respect those poor guys who saw it with little or no advance word from mags like Empire usually a bad sign if a preview copy isn t available to the quality movie mags However cinemas really should start thinking about giving out refunds if the customer isn t happy with the finished product br br I went three days after it opened with two other mates The only other person in the cinema was one bloke on his own br br And that was on cheap night br br Either the ad campaign had failed dismally or word had spread through most of the country of just what a stinker this is br br Not since the days of The Avengers 1998 have I felt so short changed since watching a movie If a mate comes round with this on video in a few months make sure he pays your electricity bill while watching it br br Tara Fitzgerald deserves an award for not cracking up or walking off the set Keith Allen retains some dignity amid the cinematic carnage Barry Foster should have been arrested on the set for his performance Rhys Ifans does his career no favours after the success of Notting Hill and only Dani Behr is halfway likeable as a busty secretary br br Mind you considering she used to be in The Word any viewers expectations of her acting ability had to be pretty low to begin with br br The production values aren t bad considering the obviously limited budget but that script is atrocious If you want to hear a bunch of unlikeable characters say Fak for a couple of hours then this should be right up your street br br Otherwise bargepoles required br br
This is a film that had a lot to live down to on the year of its release legendary film critic Barry Norman considered it the worst film of the year and I d heard nothing but bad things about it especially a plot that was criticised for being too complicated br br To be honest the plot is something of a red herring and the film suffers even more when the word plot is used because as far as I can see there is no plot as such There s something involving Russian gangsters a character called Pete Thompson who s trying to get his wife Sarah pregnant and an Irish bloke called Sean How they all fit into something called a plot I m not sure It s difficult to explain the plots of Guy Ritchie films but if you watch any of his films I m sure we can all agree that they all posses one no matter how complicated they may seem on first viewing Likewise a James Bond film though the plots are stretched out with action scenes You will have a serious problem believing RANCID ALUMINIUM has any type of central plot that can be cogently explained br br Taking a look at the cast list will ring enough warning bells as to what sort of film you ll be watching Sadie Frost has appeared in some of the worst British films made in the last 15 years and she s doing nothing to become inconsistent Steven Berkoff gives acting a bad name and he plays a character called Kant which sums up the wit of this movie while one of the supporting characters is played by a TV presenter presumably because no serious actress would be seen dead in this br br The only good thing I can say about this movie is that it s utterly forgettable I saw it a few days ago and immediately after watching I was going to write a very long a critical review warning people what they are letting themselves in for by watching but by now I ve mainly forgotten why But this doesn t alter the fact that I remember disliking this piece of crap immensely
In recent times I have been subjected to both this movie and King Arthur on DVDs chosen by others for an evening s entertainment and together they achieve nothing more than bearing out a growing notion I have that the modern movie watching public totally lacks discrimination and is content as long as they get action Both movies were utter rubbish br br Whatever happened to character development Whatever happened to meaningful dialogue Whatever happened to ACTING And when watching something that vaguely purports to be historical whatever happened to attempting to capture some measure of accuracy some realistic idea of the political map of the time even some slight flavour of the era especially in its social attitudes Why do they all have to display the value set of 21st century America I have read on the message boards of disclaimers that little was known of the dark ages Not so Considerable amounts are known with much learned scholarship on the era but these jokers simply couldn t be bothered to do any homework br br I only wish I could vote 0 10
Elizabeth Ward Gracen who will probably only be remembered as one of Bill Clinton s bimbo eruptions they have pills for that now is probably the weakest element of this show It really continues the tired formula of the Highlander Series The hero immortal encounters another immortal with flashbacks about the last time they met but there is some conflict and there is a sword fight at the end where you have a cheap special effects sequence br br Then you have the character of Nick Wolf Basically your typical unshaven 90 s hero with the typical Sexual tension storyline Seriously why do you Hollywood types think sexual tension is more interesting than sex This was a joint Canadian French production so half the series takes place in Vancouver imitating New York and the other half is in Paris Just like Highlander did
By far the worst movie of all time Even Yaphet Kotto could not save this turkey I have heard that the movie was originally supposed to be titled The Treasure but was changed to Sharks Treasure in order to take advantage of the excitement created by Jaws I think sharks were in one scene of this movie the fact that they happened to be included in this thriller was supposed to sell tickets Didn t work Anytime something good happens in the movie the ship s crew toasts each other with a certain brand of beer that had just been introduced at the time the movie was made Gee do ya think that beer might have been a sponsor Could they have made it any more obvious The only time anyone should break out the beer is if they make it through this thing That s cause enough for celebration
Sheesh What a dreadful movie Dodgy camera work a script with more corn than Kellogg s and acting so hammy you could open a pig farm with it br br To cap it all it doesn t know which audience to aim at we have Cornel Wilde or is that Corny Wilde getting on his soap box about the hazards of smoking any time someone lights a cigarette dear oh dear and in another awkward scene we have the baddie Lobo forcing his ahem if you will male friend to do a striptease dressed in a bikini Try explaining that one to the kids br br Throw in an overly contrived Treasure Island cum Jaws type storyline and the result is a film so unintentionally funny it s enjoyable I shouldn t expect a Special Edition DVD any time soon though

This movie was a real torture fest to sit through Its first mistake is treating nuclear power as so self evidently a bad thing that it barely needs to convince the audience of it When it does stoop to putting in its argument it has the participants breathlessly deliver barely substantiated facts all that s missing is someone crying when is someone going to think of the children While watching this movie I kept thinking where d you hear that or that can t possibly be true yet little of the info was backed up by any reliable sources And bless em the regular folks in the movie came across more like Luddites than people with any understanding of the pros and cons of nuclear power to be fair that might be the fault of the film makers but equally fairly it s a condition shared by the movie s rock stars br br As for the performers Now some of these people are highly respected musicians whose music I ve enjoyed and I m sure a few of them really did believe in this cause But they all come across as wheezing old hippies desperately searching for something to get worked up over now that the 60s have passed them by Particularly embarrassing are Graham Nash and James Taylor Nash seems to be trying too hard he looks like he can t possibly believe the things he s being told not that I blame him but desperate to feel noticed and included James Taylor performs what has to be the wimpiest protest anthem ever Stand and Fight in the most sickeningly cheerful way you can imagine In fact most of the performances are pretty bland when they re not being patronizing Nobody seems worked up by this event as if it really doesn t mean much to them at all It s worth noting that the driving force behind this whole event seems to be John Hall of the band Orleans and responsible for some of the wimpiest MOR pop of the 70s Remember if you dare Dance With Me and Still the One It s worth noting because that s symbolic of how the cause here fails to inspire any real passion in the music The cause is supposedly life or death but everybody sleepwalks through their numbers like they re playing the Catskills Except maybe Gil Scott Heron his protest number We Almost Lost Detroit is on topic at least but delivered with all the smugness of a high schooler impressed with how controversial he s being br br Only Bruce Springsteen s performance raises a pulse I ve never been a big fan of the Boss but he absolutely smokes no question Part of me thinks he was taped separately at another event and edited into this movie to give wake the audience Compared to the general blandness and air of self satisfaction here it s no wonder Bruce was hailed as the savior of rock n roll br br But even his performance is hobbled by the lifeless concert shooting I don t expect a lot of flashy camera movement from a 70s film but the shots are unnecessarily static broken up only by split second cutaways to a back up singer s tonsils Now some of this may be because the performers are lifeless to start with and maybe the film makers are more skilled at shooting documentaries than concert footage but all you have to do is watch Rust Never Sleeps or The Last Waltz to see a movie like this done with more skill And with more exciting musicians br br So really there s only two things to watch this movie for Springsteen s stellar performance and as a sad snapshot about a counter culture in decline
OK I have been a huge fan of the Black for a long time and was DISGUSTED after seeing this film Let s name the problems First this film has much of the same crew that the first two had It has also been called the PREQUEL to the original Black Stallion Why is it that they can t get Shetan s dam s name correct or her color In The Black Stallion Returns we learn the Sagr was the Black s CHESTNUT mother and in this film she is a gray mare name Jenny WTF And it s set in Africa in 1946 and 1947 I could be wrong but the first one was set in the 1940 s as well when the ship wrecks Time line doesn t sound quite right to me Also as a goof there is a friesian in the beginning of the movie that is supposed to be Shetan s father upon further notice it appears to be a gelding Ben Ishaak is the only character that remained to even make this film appear to be related to the previous two in any way Might be a cute family film to some but it s my biggest movie disappointment of the year
I understand that this movie is made for kids and as a parent I have sat through many movies that don t particularly hold my interest but I can appreciate from a constructive point of view in how it is being received by my children Parents are supposed to be encouraged after all to take part in their children s activities and to monitor the quality of the entertainment that they view so there should be something that appeals to an adult audience on some level even in children s movies Disney has always understood this which is why it is so hard to fathom how it could allow such a complete piece of drek to bear their name br br Technically the sound editing is horrible and all dialog sounds over dubbed and unnatural Personally I hate that but it was doubly awful considering the dialog itself seemed as though it was written by a 12 year old for a school project The acting reminded me of a school play and none of the child actors had any range of emotion in their voices Thankfully it was a very short movie br br Now before I come off like a video geek measuring a kids movie with an adult yard stick the one thing that can save even the worst children s movie is a positive message Far be it from me to determine how a message has to be delivered so long as the right one is Let us take a walk through this film to see what messages are given br br If you are lost don t worry you will inevitably find your way home br br Approach wild animals without any fear br br You can win any competition just because you know you can br br and my favorite the final message left in the film br br It s okay to disobey authority figures and do what you think is right
This extremely weak Australian excuse for a motion picture is sort of like the Pavlov Dog Experiment amongst horror movies You remember this famous Conditioned Reflex experiment from your school books right The Russian scientist Pavlov proved that dogs tended to salivate before the food actually came into their mouths and this through repetitive routines stimulating the animal s reflexes Pavlov rung a bell a couple of instants before the food was delivered to the dog and after a while he became anxious and excited and already started salivating from hearing the sound of the bell What the hell has this whole boring explanation in common with a sleazy and low budgeted Aussie slasher flick I hear you think Well the modus operandi of the maniacal killer in Nightmares is an exact variant on Pavlov s experiment Each and every single murder sequence is preceded by the raw sound and image of the killer breaking a window because he she insists on using a sharp piece of glass to slice up the victims So this means that after a short while inattentive and bored viewers can afford to doze off and simply look up again when they hear the sound of shattering glass That way they still don t miss anything special br br Regarding the quality of Nightmares as a film I can be very brief This is a cheap uninspired and largely imbecilic Aussie cash in on the contemporary popular trend of American slasher movies In the early 60 s a four year old witnesses the cruel death of her mother as her throat gets slit open in a nasty car accident Twenty years later the same girl Helen Selleck is a successful stage actress but she still has severe mental issues and regularly suffers from horrible flashbacks and traumatic nightmares She auditions for a role in a black comedy play revolving on death and gets the part Shortly after the big premiere everyone who s even remotely involved with the production gets slaughtered It is truly retarded how this movie attempts to uphold the mystery regarding the killer s identity and motivations even though even the most infantile viewer can figure it out after the first murder already I don t think I ve ever seen a more obvious whodunit than Nightmares and the creators should have just showed his her face straight away and save themselves from embarrassment The murders are explicit and very bloody and there s also an unhealthy large amount of gratuitous nudity to enjoy However the production values are poor and thus the movie is never at one point shocking or provocative The few clips we get to see of the actual play make it appear that it quite possible could be the worst thing ever performed on stage The only positive elements in the film are the characters of the director and the gay newspaper critic whom are both delightfully sarcastic and insult the rest of the cast members as much as we do Nightmares is a dreadful piece of exploitative horror cinema but hey at least I gave you a golden tip to make it more digestible
Jenny Neumann from the sexploitation flick MISTRESS OF THE APES the American slasher HELL NIGHT and others is Helen Selleck an American actress who gets a lead role in an Australian stage production She s a virgin because as a little girl she saw her mom having sex and then accidentally caused the car accident that killed her Meanwhile a black gloved killer prowls around the theater slashing up people with shards of glass br br MAJOR SPOILER br br The killer is obviously Helen she speaks in her dead mother s voice washes blood off her hands after the murders and is seen killing a child molester with a broken bottle as a little girl but this has gratuitous heavy breathing POV camera work and conceals the identity of the murderer until the very end like it s supposed to be some big surprise br br The entire cast seems obsessed with talking about having or trying to have sex and in one case even blackmailing their way into getting laid There s quite a bit of nudity and blood but there s no sense of continuity the photography is murky and the editing by Colin Eggleston who also scripted and produced is terrible The theater setting for a slasher film predates Soavi s film of the same name and Argento s OPERA both of which are better than this one by five years though and Neumann is pretty hot
This is a direct sequel to The Mummy s Hand 1940 because the lead character Stephen Banning played by Dick Foran is now thirty years older and is relating the story with the help of archival footage to his son s fiancé There are only two unusual aspects to the film the early death of Banning and the presence of Turhan Bey br br Lon Chaney as the mummy Kharis gets top billing though given the nature of his role he has little more to do than limp along or thrash his arms about There s nothing scary about his presence except for his attempt to carry off the fiancé Isobel Elyse Knox Dick Foran gets second billing but he s killed off within the first fifteen minutes We d have to wait until Psycho 1960 when a lead character Janet Leigh dies way before the end of the movie Banning s buddy from the first film Babe Jenson now Henson shows up a little later looking much much older and not doing any of the comic shtick he did in the original It s hard to believe it s the same actor Unfortunately this great acting job is wasted because he gets killed by Kharis after only two brief scenes It s then left up to Banning s son John played by bit player John Hubbard to led the chase to the cemetery NO The sheriff leads a torch wielding mob to Banning s house to burn it down and kill the mummy Sound Universally familiar br br Turhan Bey is introduced to audiences as the new High Priest Mehmet Bey to care for and feed tana leaves to Kharis With his exotic voice and appearance it s too bad he gets so easily killed A better movie would have had Babe take Von Helsing type charge of things in tracking down the mummy with a final decisive battle with him and Mehmet Bay But instead we have a pedestrian rehash of different set pieces from previous Universal horror films put together by the hack Griffin Jay who wrote many of Universal s other clunkers although he also did Don Winslow of the Navy 1942 as well as Don Winslow of the Coast Guard 1943 which also featured Elyse Knox br br Elyse Knox played Anne Howe in six Joe Palooka movies 1946 1949 and of course Turhan Bey with 43 movie and TV credits is great in the title role of The Amazing Dr X 1948 br br The cinematography is much darker and more atmospheric with lots of noirish shadows in the sheriff s office than the first Kharis mummy film but there s little else of interest or excitement br br I ll give it a 3
The Mummy s Tomb starts with a review of the events in The Mummy s Hand and then moves the story forward several years and across the ocean to the United States of America where the current high priest and the mummy Kharis set out to wreak havoc and take revenge on those who violated the tomb in the past br br While I absolutely loved The Mummy with Boris Karloff as the mummy Imhotep and quite liked The Mummy s Hand with Tom Tyler as Kharis which is the direct prequel to this film I was not as taken with The Mummy s Tomb br br It is made in a similar style as the previous film and has a somewhat similar plot albeit in a new setting Lon Chaney Jr is okay as Kharis but doesn t really stand out And I guess that s my main criticism of this movie that nothing really stands out There s nothing really terrible here but nothing really outstanding either so the viewer is left with a rather bland mummy s tale
1st watched 5 27 2009 4 out of 10 Dir Harold Young The 3rd Universal mummy movie is about the same as the first two as far as the final result from the viewer s perspective The story is similar and the results are ho hum This time the story s location is the U S as the Egyptian priest s new follower sends a mummy to our country in hopes he can revive him to kill descendants of those who opened the original tomb This time the mummy is played by Lon Chaney which doesn t make much of a difference because he s really not asked to do much acting for this character The new priest becomes a morgue keeper in the town and sends the mummy out to do his dirty deeds after feeding him the tanna leaf juice Again a girl gets in the way as the priest falls for one of the descendent s fiancé and wants her yes to be immortal with him haven t we heard this before The plan is of course thwarted as the townsfolk hunt down the mummy with torches similar to the Frankenstein monster and the burning of the creature ends the story how do they get a sequel I guess you ll find out with the next one in the series or not
Nothing will ruin a movie as much as the combination of a poor script and poor direction This is the case with The Mummy s Tomb br br The script is leftover ideas from older better Universal horror flicks like Dracula and Frankenstein The direction is trite and stale The acting is mediocre Even Chaney s Kharis is feeble compared to Tom Tyler s in The Mummy s Hand and the producers are foolish enough to add footage from Christy Cabanne s vastly better prequel and point up the weakness of their own film br br Universal realized how bad this movie was and essentially remade it from scratch two years later as The Mummy s Ghost with a much better script and better director The result was likely the best film in their four film Mummy cycle although not anywhere near as good as Karl Freund s 1932 original br br Cabanne s footage raises this film to a 3 The new stuff is a 2 at best Dick Foran and Wallace Ford were probably glad to see their characters bumped off so they wouldn t have to appear in dreck like this anymore
Cheap mediocre sequel to the successful The Mummy s Hand has presumably dead evil Professor Andoheb George Zucco preparing his predecessor Mehemet Bey Turhan Bey for the quest of revenge overseas to America using mummy Kharis Lon Chaney Jr who has no reason being in the disguise any stunt man could do the same credible work lumbering around and choking victims in the goal of killing the surviving members of the Banning family whose patriarch Stephen Dick Foran and assistant Babe Hanson Wallace Ford retrieved the mummified corpse of Princess Ananka from her tomb in Egypt Andoheb considers this an outlandish act of desecration and wants the family to suffer for doing such an awful deed towards an ancient Egyptian custom Bey and the mummy Kharis find a nice hideaway in a cemetery where the High Priest of Karnak can work as a caretaker in disguise Every Full Moon Bey will feed Kharis a form of liquid derived of several Tana leaves which will keep him not only alive but subservient to his master s wishes Bey commands Kharis to kill Stephen and his sister Jane Mary Gordon while also biding time for Babe to return so that he will become victim 3 Dr John Banning John Hubbard plans to wed Isobel Elyse Knox but doesn t know that Bey secretly covets his fiancé making plans to kidnap her with Kharis help John s life is in danger because of his father he s also the last remaining member of the Banning line If Bey has Isobel there s no chance of any more Bannings being born The police must find Kharis and the one responsible for his carnage Bey br br This film is a continuation from HAND set years later as members of that film Foran Ford Zucco all appear in aging make up providing wrinkles showing the gaps in time as Andoheb has been preparing for the deaths of the Bannings The cornball romance of John and Isobel seems merely in this plot so that Bey will screw up endangering his perfect plan which was being carried out successfully before he loused it up And Bey merely sees her frolicking with John on the grass the whole love at first sight rubbish really didn t wash for me Plus you have the mummy being able to kill people with one arm is any mummy really THAT powerful This film also uses a ton of footage from the previous film to save budget on this sequel to it There really isn t that much story here and yes typical of Universal monster pictures even in America a mob of people will light ho hum torches going after Kharis You know how it ll end John and the super powerful Kharis will square off in some huge mansion with fire burning all around them with the evil one being engulfed in flame
A resurrected wrapped monster goes on a murdering binge A lunatic is seeking revenge against living members of a previous expedition Universal seems to be running out of wrapping as well as new ideas Most of the budget was probably spent on Lon Chaney Jr to star as Kharis the Mummy br br Other players are George Zucco Wallace Ford Turhan Bey Dick Foran and Elyse Knox br br How much longer can this madness continue

This is a very bad western mainly because it is historically inaccurate It looks as if it were shot on a back lot in California instead of where Jack Slade lived and died Idaho Colorado Territories and Montana It fictionalizes everything that is known about this mysterious bad man good man The script is horrible there is very little direction and lousy acting Dorothy Malone is completely wasted as his wife Mark Steven never seems to know how to portray this mysterious Jack Slade In real life Jack Slade was a very good stage line superintendent He was feared by his local townsmen for his hard drinking When drunk he would start fights and cause other problems in Virginia City Montana To insure that he could never terrorize them again vigilantes lynched Jack Slade after he ignored their warning to leave town immediately This is a horrible movie I can not recommend anyone to watch this movie other than to see how Hollywood butches history at will even to this day
Back again in Scotland Lassie is again on trial for her life Because the faithful dog sleeps on her master s grave she must be put to death according to law Oddly it is also explained that Lassie had no legal owner which is apparently also against an old Scottish law If after three days no owner is located dogs must be destroyed Edmund Gwenn as John Traill pleads Lassie s case which leads to an extended flashback showing Lassie s adoption by Donald Crisp as John Jock Gray br br Although it s based on an interesting original story Greyfriars Bobby Challenge to Lassie revisits several earlier Lassie situations and it does not improve upon them Comparatively speaking this one is sloppy and unexciting and it s a disappointing follow up to The Sun Comes Up 1949 Geraldine Brooks as Susan Brown and several of the other performers may be charming but can t elevate this one Little Jimmy Hawkins from It s a Wonderful life is among the notable children supporting Lassie much later he will grow up to marry Dark Shadows bewitching Angelique Lara Parker
The Perfectly Stupid Weapon I think the guys dancing at the beginning of one of Steven Segal s movies was intented to mock Jeff doing his forms to dance music at the beginning of this stupid movie The plot is predictable the fights were fair and Jeff acts about as well as the sofa he beats with some sort of weapon in one scene
br br Get your brewskies out and enjoy this flawed action flick Speakman s considerable kempo skill nice spin kicks decent with the sticks poor couch is the only redeeming quality of a movie that just cries bad acting The plot isn t half bad just executed pretty poorly But if you re seeing this movie for anything other than martial arts you re missing the boat entirely And for a movie that is supposed to take place in Koreatown way way too few Korean actors even extras
Bad plot though good for a B movie good fast paced fight scenes at most a 5 out of 10 But something has always bothered me about this film how come Mariska Hargitay never speaks In the TV version she shares several intimate moments with Jeff Speakman even a kiss in a garden Yet in the regular video version most of her scenes are cut and she never speaks at all This bothers me because it not only takes out a female though cliched point of view to the film it also makes the final shot seem creepy This film would have been better had they kept her scenes in because in those scenes at least she has a personality one that undercuts whatever Speakman says
First of all yes animals have emotions If you didn t know that already then I believe you are a moron But let s assume that none of us are morons We all know that animals have emotions and we now want to see how these emotions are manifest in nature correct br br What we get instead is a tedious and ridiculously simplistic documentary that attempts to show how animals are human The filmmakers search high low for footage of animals engaged in human like behaviour and when it happens they say That monkey is almost human that s actually a direct quote br br Everything is in human terms They waste time theorizing about what makes dogs smile but not once do they mention what a wagging tail means The arrogance of these researchers is disgusting They even go so far as to show chimpanzees dressed in human clothing and wearing a cowboy hat br br I had been expecting an insightful documentary of animals on their own terms I wanted to learn how animals emote in their OWN languages But instead researchers keep falling back on pedantic anthropomorphic observations and assumptions Add a cheezy soundtrack and images of chimps celebrating Christmas and this was enough to turn my stomach br br But it doesn t end there Half of this documentary is filmed not in the wild but in laboratories and experimental facilities All the camera shots of chimps are through steel bars and we see how these monkeys are crowded together in their sterile concrete cages One particularly sobering moment happens near the beginning though you have to be quick to notice it where a captive monkey says in sign language Want out Hurry go br br Obscure references are made to stress tests and psychological experiments which I shudder to imagine Baby monkeys are separated from their mothers at birth and are given wireframe dolls in order to prove that baby monkeys crave a mother figure And after 40 years of experiments the smug researchers pat themselves on the back for reaching their brilliant conclusion monkeys have emotions br br One chimp named Washoe has been in a concrete cage since 1966 for that purpose and to this day she remains thus We get a brief glimpse again through bars of her leaning against a concrete wall with a rather lackluster expression Personally I don t need to see any further experimental data Washoe I apologize for our entire species
I vaguely remember Ben from my Sci Fi fandom days of the 60s I was doing several interviews bios of obscure actors actresses most notably Ben actress Fay Spain and Jody Fair who played Angela in 1961 s The Young Savages Ben was one of the people at a low key Sci Fi con in Chicago about 1970 when I had a nice chat with him and his career and life All these were published in some now long forgotten fanzine of the day Wish I still had copies of those interviews but time marches on and any of those people surely wouldn t remember me at all so many years later Ben was a really nice fellow ekeing out a living The cons of those days didn t even pay their guest unless of course they were big name stars and even then the pay was a couple hundred dollars at most Good to know Ben s still alive kicking How bout a remake of Creature but 50 years older Ugly then uglier now
This movie deserves credit for its original approach It combines elements of theater film and epic storytelling Unfortunately it falls flat on all levels The films biggest weakness is it s unwillingness to commit to anything it has camp moralistic and epic elements without ever committing to any of them As for the story itself Chretien de Troyes is spinning in his grave at this horrible adaptation which turns the lovable unbearably innocent Percival into a most ungallant and rude churl br br Most likely two types of people will see this francophiles or Arthuriophiles Speaking as one of the latter I found the movie unwatchable and an incredibly shabby disrespectful treatment of a beautiful story
and it doesn t help rohmer s case that a few years later Syberberg came along and made a staggeringly great piece of work on the same subject with a little help from Wagner br br maybe this movie didn t look so paltry when it came out without the syberberg film to compare it to which was probably shot on an even smaller sound stage with fewer resources I actually can t recall at the moment whether there are horses in the syberberg film all I know is the German version is pure magic while this one looks like some college production documented on film for archival purposes br br the music la musique isn t even credited here on IMDb but someone based it on airs from the 12th 14th centuries or something well it isn t a great help to the film it comes off as inauthentic and cheesy comme le frommage mon cher br br rohmer is one of those french auteurs who likes his leading men generally quite unattractive too and that doesn t help matters syberberg s Parsifal was adorable and can be seen on German television today selling some kind of special bicycle he invented br br I shudder to think what watching the syberberg on video is like I remember that the last time I saw the film in a theater the print was so bad that the experience was a whopping 5 hour travesty But even then it would have to surpass what this version has to offer I m afraid br br points for earnestness for chutzpah but this film simply needed beau coup more bucks it doesn t look like a medieval manuscript it looks CHEAPO BON MARCHE oh and yeah it just ends very arbitrarily with Parsifal going to church and this cheesy passion play being interjected blah
This movie is probably the worst I have seen Bad acting bad script bad everything Comparing it to mainly two other movies in the same genre and from approximately the same time is interesting Both Cyborg Van Damme 1989 and Nemesis Olivier Gruner 1993 are much better and seems more robust in both story and directing and still it s Albert Pyun who has directed these two as well br br The story is not original The world has become a terrible place possibly due to an environmental disaster or a nuclear war and people live under medieval circumstances A special breed of robots cyborgs live on human blood and there s the story The cyborgs need to get a lot of humans to fulfill there prophecy and the humans need someone to stop them One girl together with a robot Kris Kristofferson built by the creator of the cyborgs has been appointed by destiny to save mankind br br In this movie the director tries some Hong Kong stylish fighting scenes with the participants flying high and leaping far The movie fails miserably in this attempt br br I recommend this film with the only reason that most people will get a new worst ever movie to relate to And to fans of the genre I recommend Cyborg since I think it s a very underestimated movie with quite a high entertaining factor And if you can t stand Van Damme then check out Nemesis br br I rated this movie 1 10
Still a sucker for Pyun s esthetic sense I liked this movie though the unfinished ending was a let down As usual Pyun develops a warped sense of humour and Kathy Long s fights are extremely impressive Beautifully photographed this has the feel it was done for the big screen
Knights was just a beginning of a series a pilot one might say The plot I really shouldn t call it that there wasn t any plot wasn t logical at all and there were many mistakes like warning I m summarizing the plot br br In the beginning of the movie someone said that there was only a couple of those cyborgs the bad guys but after the climax Nea found out that there were many many more left of them And it was told that cyborgs were hard to kill but after a month s training Nea could kill them with a single blow br br The movie was just pure kicking I wasn t surprised at all when I found out that the leading star was a kick boxer br br There was ONE positive thing in the whole movie it really gave a great deal of laughter when watching it and talking about it with my friends I recommend watching it if you are in need of laughter
This move is about as bad as they come I was however forced to give it a 2 for the scenery There are many great shots of the southwest including many in Monument Valley one of the most breathtaking places in the US It is also starting with John Ford one of the most filmed In fact one scene with Kris and the girl was filmed on a place called John Ford point
Once in a while you get amazed over how BAD a film can be and how in the world anybody could raise money to make this kind of crap There is absolutely No talent included in this film from a crappy script to a crappy story to crappy acting Amazing
Vampire cyborgs rule the world and use the blood of humans as fuel however there is going to be a shift of power thanks to a renegade android Kris Kristofferson and a warrior woman Kathly Long as they face off against Lance Henriksen and Gary Daniels Who play the cyborgs in this ridiculous movie Of all the questions left unanswered by this dreadful movie the most poignant is Who s idea was it to cast country singer Kris Kristofferson as a cyborg warrior who is able to give as good as he gets No don t get me wrong I could see Kristofferson as a vigilante or something but not as a cyborg Strangely one suspects that this was written for Dolph Lundgren however Lundgren must have had the wisdom to not do it However despite the disastrous casting Kristofferson is easily the most enjoyable thing about the movie He gives a performance far more human then the inexpressive Kathy Long And Kristofferson is playing a robot despite the miscasting Kristofferson provides the few moments of interest Lance Henriksen is slumming and Gary Daniels is wasted but basically Knights is baffling failure You stand back in horror wondering who the hell thought that this was even a good idea on paper This is a movie where a dismembered Kristofferson is fighting robots in a backpack Worst of all it ends in a what if sequel thankfully this has yet to materialize although I still have nightmares at the proposition of the likelihood of such an event br br out of 4 Bad
someone needed to make a car payment this is truly awful makes jean Claude s cyborg look like gone with the wind this is an hour I wish I could sue to get back luckily it produced severe somnolence from which I fell asleep how can actors of this caliber create this dog I would rather spend the time watching algae grow on the side of a fish tank than partake of this wholly awful concoction of several genre I now use the DVD as a coaster on my coffee table 5 99 at walmart is far too much to spend on this movie if you really have to have it wait till they throw them out after they have carried them on the inventory for several years and are frustrated that they would not sell br br please for the love of god let this movie die of obscurity
You can t really go far when the initial story isn t all that great The premise of cyborg s needing blood is just dopey br br The script is blasé The actors don t have much to work with The sets were staged out in the desert to cut costs It s a trademark that if the background is the desert then the movie has no budget br br Lack of budget is okay if there s a story Solarbabies and Blood of Champions are examples of decent work from no but this movie looks as if they had to scrape their change together just to buy the cameraman a sandwich Again forgivable if only the story didn t just plain suck br br Finally this movie commits the biggest crime of all It doesn t finish It simply ends as if it s a commercial break away from the rest of the movie But the rest never comes Just odd br br Just bad
There is a word for this sort of film and that word is drivel It was drivel when it was a VHS rental and it s drivel on satellite re runs now br br It might fool you because it has 2 moderately well known names in Kistofferson and Henriksen reasonable soundtrack music and nice Monument Valley scenery br br It also has some curly haired woman who fights a lot br br If that s all you want from a movie then maybe this will keep you happy br br It s still drivel though
This movie will promote the improvement of the mind Read a book It s incredible anyone would think this movie deserved the time and investment to make I ve seen B movies before but the C movie has just been invented I didn t think I would ever enjoy Power Rangers since my kids stopped watching but I found myself looking for the videos fifteen minutes into Knights High school productions are better than this and the actors involved should erase this from their resume Embarrassment is one of many descriptions that come to mind My roommate who loves these types of movies even turned it off Now that has to really tell you something If you watch this movie and like it I will pray for you
I tuned into this thing one night on a cable channel a few minutes after the credits ran so I didn t know who had done it at first The longer I saw it the more I started thinking Jesus this looks like an Albert Pyun flick Wasn t quite sure though for two main reasons the photography was quite good and the Utah desert scenery was beautiful and Scott Paulin gave an hilarious performance as Simon a murderous cyborg but with some style and a sense of humor Paulin must have ad libbed the many clever one liners he shot out because Albert Pyun hasn t written anything even remotely funny or coherent in his career Unfortunately Paulin doesn t have all that much screen time before he s gone and the movie s the worse for it Lance Henriksen playing the evil head cyborg growls his way through his part as he s done in countless other movies like this I don t know what the hell Kris Kristofferson is doing in this thing maybe he wanted to see what the Utah desert looked like and get paid for it He goes through the movie looking and sounding like he just woke up and in fact spends most of the last half of the movie on his back in a tent Kathy Long the nominal hero has a great body is attractive has a great body fights extremely well has a great body and doesn t have an iota of acting talent but that doesn t matter in a movie like this This being an Albert Pyun film it s full of the trademarks that we ve all come to know and love inane and idiotic dialog choppy editing and the impression that they lost a reel in the middle of the picture and figured Ah nobody ll ever notice br br As bad as this movie is however it s a shade above most of Pyun s other efforts this is Citizen Kane compared to his brain numbing Adrenaline Feel the Rush for example The fights are pretty well done if repetitive after she knocks down eight or nine guys one after the other you find yourself saying Alright already go to something else and Long is very athletic and as a previous poster has noted has a great derrière It s not a good movie by any stretch of the imagination but it s not anywhere near as incoherent and incompetent as Pyun s usual extravaganzas You could do worse than rent this movie not much worse granted but worse nonetheless

This is one of the two postapocalyptic fantasy movies that Albert Pyun made in 1993 and it s the bad one Apparently all his energy went into Nemesis which was an entertaining non stop action movie and had a much more expensive look Knights is clunky and cheesy a bottom of the barrel sci fi that too often resembles a video game new opponents pop up all the time and must be exterminated as quickly as possible The only thing that saves this movie from the trash can is Kathy Long not a particularly attractive woman but undeniably a brutally efficient fighting machine As for Kris Kristofferson considering his age at the time 58 I hope his stunt double was well paid 1 2
Set in a post apocalyptic environment cyborgs led by warlord Job rein over the human population They basically keep them as livestock as they need fresh human blood to live off Nea and her brother managed to survive one of their attacks when she was a kid and years have past when she came face to face with the cyborgs again but this time she s saved by the cyborg Gabriel who was created to destroy all cyborgs Job and his men are on their way to capture a largely populated city while Nea with revenge on mind pleads Gabriel to train her in the way of killing cyborgs and she ll get him to Gabriel br br Cheap low rent cyborg post apocalyptic foray by writer director Albert Pyun who made Cyborg prior to it and the blistering Nemsis the same year is reasonably a misguided hunk of junk with some interesting novelties Very little structure makes its way into the threadbare story as the turgid script is weak corny and overstated The leaden banter tries to be witty but it pretty much stinks and comes across being comical in the unintentional moments Most of the occurring actions are pretty senseless and routine The material could ve used another polish up as it was an inspired idea swallowed up by lazy inclusions lack of a narrative and an almost jokey tone The open ended cliffhanger conclusion is just too abrupt especially since a sequel has yet to be made Makes it feel like that that run out of money and said Time to pack up Let s finish it off another day or maybe in another decade There s no rush However it did find it rather diverting thanks largely to its quick pace some well executed combat and George Mooradian s gliding cinematography that beautifully captured the visually arresting backdrop Performances are fair Kris Kristofferson s dry and steely persona works perfectly as Gabriel and a self assured psychically capable Kathy Long pulls off the stunts expertly and with aggression However her acting is too wooden A mugging Lance Henriksen gives a mouth watering performance of pure ham as the villainous cyborg leader Job who constantly having a saliva meltdown Scott Paulin also drums up plenty of gleefulness as one of the cyborgs and Gary Daniels pouts about as one too Pyun strikes up few exciting martial art set pieces involving some flashy vigour and gratuitous slow motion Seeping into the background is a scorching but mechanical sounding music score The special effects and make up FX stand up fine enough Watchable but not quite a success and it s minimal limitations can be a cause of that
Every once in a while I will rent an action adventure film just as a way to relax and occupy my mind with nothing important This is why I own a copy of Charlie s Angels 2000 not a quality film but it makes me laugh and allows me to unwind for a while One of these days I will probably buy copies of The Princess Bride and a few Monty Python movies for much the same reason br br In any case I rented this film because I wanted to be entertained without being challenged For the most part I got what I wanted The plot was something along the lines of a poorly written Xena episode and the Kathy Long s acting was very community theater not bad for a professional kick boxer and amateur actress There were a few high points on the part of the cyborgs Somehow they managed to get some pretty good actors to play the bad guys unfortunately most of them die pretty darned quick br br Like most martial arts films the further you get into the movie the more emphasis there is on action and the plot which wasn t strong to begin with deteriorates almost as quickly as the acting However the more Kathy Long fights the more time the director devotes to her backside By the end of the movie I was seriously considering watching it a second time just to count the number of times Kathy Long s tight red shorts were center screen br br Unfortunately there just wasn t enough meat to this film to make satisfying curiosity worth seeing the film a second time If you are a hard core Xena fan in need of something to wile away a few hours by all means go to the grocery store and spend the 50 cents on the rental There are some strong similarities between the show and this movie br br Just don t expect anything more than to be mildly amused for a few hours br br Unless of course you happen to like Kathy Long s derrière THEN you might want to purchase a copy
Elizabeth Taylor never could act at all and she was just her usual annoying untalented self in this film This was before she got so fat but she still looked very short and dumpy Rock Hudson was OK as Bick Benedict but clearly an actor with more range like William Holden would have been better James Dean certainly proved he knew how to mumble his way through a movie The whole film is incredibly slow and goes on for far too long The actors were all too young and lightweight and none of them aged convincingly due to the poor make up Hudson looked ridiculous just being padded out and Dean and Carroll Baker were obviously the same age br br 0 10
Giant is one of the most boring overly long Hollywood contraptions ever Many scenes seem utterly fake and without energy Rock Hudson Elizabeth Taylor and James Dean are wasted in this big Hollywood production A central notion to this movie that a rancher would ever resist drilling for oil on his land is absurd and I know this because I m from Houston A couple of scenes especially Dean serving Taylor coffee redeem this otherwise boring film For a much more accurate and interesting depiction about how modernism changed the ranches in Texas see Hud one of Paul Newman s great performances or The Last Picture Show
With all due disrespect for this George Stevens Sr epic of miscastings and misreadings I can only wonder that the James Dean legend could survive this outing I submit that then studio obeisances to bankable box office giants came a cropper of its own gigantismoses Nor were Rock and Liz that much better off Let us just say that the televised Dallas was the authentic heir even if contemp tuous latterday Texans like Lay and DELay not to mention our putative president of these here Yewbenighted States of Amurrika perform a one upsmanship of dastardly global dimensions I never read Edna Ferber s original but will lay odds it is head and shoulders superior to what got on screen herein And all those well paid I would imagine supporting actors of note and celebrity notwithstanding Giant is to me at least a midget of scant merit never mind the promo campaigns
As big as a Texas prairie and equally as boring Even Liz Taylor James Dean Chill Wills and Dennis Hopper can t float this overbloated boat Taylor actually LOOKS bad wrong wardrobe wrong hair and wrong makeup a unique accomplishment in her remarkable career Hopper gives the only believable performance and Dean in the climactic scene displays remarkable talent as something we usually don t remember him for a comic actor Rock Hudson is his usual prototype of Barbie Doll Ken and makes one wonder what a say Redford could have done with the male lead There is no discernible plot that provides any tension until the final twenty minutes just a pastiche of milestones that have little relationship to each other Except for Hopper there is no character development only a collection of cardboard cutouts that pop up periodically for no discernible reason like random targets in a shooting gallery To its credit the film does tackle racism and sexism at a time when they were taboo subjects and it does have SIZE making it an excellent choice for ridding yourself of unwelcome house guests Those with the DVD version can spare themselves some of the tedium by starting with the second disk You won t be missing anything of interest
This movie is just crap Even though the directors claim to be part of that oi culture it s still a very very bad directorial debut The topic itself is very interesting and I accept the bad acting due to the fact that they are all amateurs and never acted before but the worst thing about this film are the dialogs and very unexperienced and naive directing There s no timing at all in that movie I felt like the directors were so exited to do that movie it s their first feature that they actually never really asked themselves what story they wanna tell I met Ben one of the directors on several occasions and he s a nice and thoughtful guy but that doesn t make him a director I think that American History X is full of clichés but somehow manages to transport a story Oi Warning is full of clichés doesn t tell anything new or provocative and that s the sad thing about this movie it s far from any Oi Reality br br If you wanna see weird but great German films watch the movies of Michael Haneke Christoph Schlingensief Oskar Roehler Hans Weingartner or Oliver Hirschbiegel br br Benny s Video Funny Games Die Unberührbare Mein Letzter Film Das Experiment Das Weisse Rauschen Muxmäuschenstill br br out of ten because of the topic and the photography
Here s yet another blasphemous European story in which they blast the religion of their country These atheist filmmakers are relentless Here we see a brutal blasting of Catholics and or the Catholic clergy and I am not Catholic br br This won actually won an Academy Award for bes foreign film That s probably because the story made Catholics and religious belief in general look extremely weak One of the main characters is a priest and he cares more about food than anything else He s portrayed as nothing but an idiot No wonder the secular dominated Academy loved this movie br br Also there is some overacting fool who plays a guy who renounces his religion so he can marry one of the four daughters featured in the story The daughters take turns seducing the seminary student who states he studied for six years but says he s an agnostic I mean how blasphemous IS this film br br This is a disgrace and another excellent example of the secular progressive bigotry of the film business worldwide not just Hollywood
I recently watched Belle Epoque thinking it might be wonderful as it did win an Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film I was a bit underwhelmed by the predictability and simplicity of the film Maybe the conflict I had was that from the time the movie was filmed to now the plot of a man falling for beautiful women and eventually falling for the good girl has been done so many times Aside from predictability of the plot some scenes in the film felt really out of place with the storyline ex a certain event at the wedding At times the film was a bit preachy in it s ideas and in relation to the Franco era the film was set in and the Church The only thing the film had going for it was the cutesy moments the scenery and the character of Violeta being a strong independent woman during times when women were not really associated with those characteristics
An allegation of aggravated sexual assault along with some other unpleasant peccadilloes including improper use of a broom are made against half a dozen or so of the most popular high school jocks in Glen Ridge New Jersey by a mildly retarded student Heather Matarazzo The investigation and building of the case are handed over to the DA s office where Ally Sheedy and Eric Stoltz are put in charge br br Rumors about the case spread through Glen Ridge an upper middle class suburb where the jocks are adored by everyone in the community One of their fathers is a police lieutenant Nobody believes Matarazzo Our boys would never take a slut like that down to the basement rape her and subject her to such sexual humiliation The question is whether Sheedy and Stoltz will ever be able to shape a sufficiently cogent case that they can bring the jocks to trial Matarazzo is not an ideal plaintiff She s desperate for love and friendship and that makes it easy for faux friends to mislead her into making false statements A slimy reporter says You can trust me but it turns out the reporter can t be trusted at all Another student a very popular girl in school pulls a Linda Tripp on Matarazzo pretending to be her bosom buddy but all the while asking her leading questions about the incident and taping the results As a consequence watching this story unfold is like being on a roller coaster At first it looks like a good case for Sheedy and Stoltz But then oops the community organizes against the law Then it looks good again But then the reporter interferes Then that obstacle is no sooner overcome than Linda Tripp pokes her big nose into the investigation and makes public the tapes that seem to indicate Matarazzo was lying Well actually she WAS lying but she was lying to her interrogator in order to please her Then that s overcome but Matarazzo objects to taking the stand because she doesn t want to be characterized as retarded Eric Stoltz is fine in the part of the prosecutor I say that for the simple reason that he and I lived in Pago Pago around the same time I hope he wasn t the kid I had that altercation with at the bar of the Seaside Club If he was I take back my compliment Ally Sheedy is a strange actress and hard to characterize She did a marvelous self restrained job in Fine Art but I didn t sense any particular effort being put into this role which was rather formulaic anyway I mean neither she nor Stoltz nor anyone else could give a bravura performance in what s essentially a comic book story br br The producers and director had the good sense to choose Heather Matarazzo for the role of victim The very worst thing they could have done is cast an ethereally lovely neotenous blond Instead Matarazzo without being at all ugly looks rather plain and this ordinary quality is complemented by her grooming and make up Nor have the writers turned her wistful and gentle She has a temper and is sometimes irritating to listen to which is all for the good br br Matarazzo s character is the best drawn in the film The jocks are stereotypes Pure evil They think themselves above the law barge in on some nice girl s party in East Orange trash the place during a party far worse than La Dolce Vita s climactic orgy and leave without explanation or apology They deserve to get it in the neck and they do br br I referred to this as a comic book story and that s pretty much what it is It challenges none of our prejudices It reaffirms out belief that the world can be divided into Good and Evil And we don t have a moment s doubt about who s who What I m waiting for not really that s just rhetorical is a movie almost exactly like this one and a dozen others but in which the victim is LYING in order to get her name and photo in the papers and garner all those sympathy chips from right thinking folk like the rest of us br br The film is based on a true story as are so many others we ve all seen and even more fictional features Eg The Accused Some are good some are strictly routine Okay Fair enough Now when do we get to see a film about the Tawana Brawley case in which the teen aged girl disappeared on a whim for a few days then had her friends strip her tie her up and smear her with dirt so she could claim she d been abducted and raped by the police Now THAT would be a challenge in a way this one simply is not
I am normally a Spike Lee fan It takes some time to really get into his mojo but once you see the clear message and the ability to tell the story that is close to his heart Lee is a genius Unlike The 25th Hour or Bamboozled two of my favorite films of his there was no clear story in this film I was able to understand the struggle between Washington and the choice to play well or be influenced by others but for some odd reason Lee was never able to get the true feeling out Washington did a decent job with what was handed to him but you could tell that this was not Lee s favorite film Not only did Lee direct this film but he also wrote it You could tell The camera work was horrid and the writing only contributed to the decay of the film This film was coming full circle and it wasn t going to be pretty Lee was not 100 behind this film as he was with Do the Right Thing Of all the films I have seen Lee direct this was the brightest and more modest of his films It was almost as if he created a Hollywood movie instead of one that was all his own I don t know if he saw the money from Do the Right Thing and ran with it or what but this film did not demonstrate his true talent br br For anyone out there that has seen this film and perhaps stopped watching anything directed by Spike Lee afterwards due to this film I suggest you give him a second chance Don t get me wrong I see exactly where you are coming from with this film and why you would want to put this behind you but Lee does grow up His work becomes more of his own and you can see the transformation from a desire to make money to just wanting to make good films It took me awhile to watch The 25th Hour but when I did it was sheer brilliance Perhaps it was the actors perhaps the story but Lee crafted an amazing film out of one man s journey into the unknown I guess that is what I was hoping Mo Better Blues would turn out to be This really dark journey into the life of a man that really never grew up but instead all I got was Denzel being Denzel He really is one of the most versatile actors of this generation and I do consider him the Sydney Poitier of cinema but this was not the film to showcase his talent br br Another issue that I had with this film was the use of Spike s sister playing one of the love interests I don t know about you and your family but I do not think that I could have filmed a sex scene with my sister I don t care who the actor is or how much money I am getting paid I would never do it It is just something that I never wish to see but apparently that is different for Spike He went ahead and showed the full nude image of his sister without any remorse It was sad and it even made me blush Also I need somebody to answer me this What was Flavor Flav doing introducing this film So I am sitting there on my couch ready to start the film when suddenly there is a voice from the past spelling out the studio that made this film then he acknowledges himself That did not build for a strong remaining of the story Again I felt that Lee was going for money on this film instead of actual talent Perhaps that is how he could afford both Denzel and Wesley in the same movie without any explosions br br There were two great scenes in this film that made it worth watching through to the end Don t get me wrong this was a very bad movie but there is always a diamond in every alleyway The scene when Bleek accidentally forgets which woman he is with was mesmerizing He continually went back and forth weaving truth to confusion in a way that proved that Lee was actually behind the camera It was a visionary scene that was probably lost in the shuffle due to the remaining poor scenes The other scene that was worth watching was the way that Lee introduced and ended the film By keeping the same pacing and direction he was able to bring this tragic character around full circle and give him the chance to change his life Other than these two moments the rest of the film was pure rubbish not worth viewing unless you are about to go blind br br Grade out of
Things get dull early an often in this in this mawkish jazz bio fiction written and directed by Spike Lee br br Bleek Gilliam Denzell Washington is a happenin jazz trumpeter that fronts a quintet packing them in at Below the Underdog His problems include an incompetent manager a stage hogging sax player and two girlfriends that he s playing musical mattress with The real love of his life though is his trumpet and his music The band s manager Giant has a dangerous gambling problem and proves to be an ineffective negotiator with greedy club owners and would be best jettisoned but Bleek remains loyal for as long as possible It will prove to his undoing as an artist but ironically contribute to his growth as a man br br As Bleek Denzell Washington is all wrong as the ambitious trumpeter with a babe on each arm He s too sweet a guy to be so self centered about his art dispensing patience and love to those close to him with a low key remoteness He simply lacks the fire Wesley Snipes who plays Henderson the sax player would have been far more suited for the role but even he would have to mouth the flaccid throw away scribblings of Lee s torpid dialogue As Giant Lee hits the trifecta with an abysmal performance to match his writing and direction Loosely attempting to mirror the grubby but sympathetic Ratso Rizzo to Bleek s Joe Buck he adopts a limp and even the I m walkin here moment from Midnight Cowboy In this case you wish the taxi would run him over and be done with it br br Lee s script is all tepid argument heavy handed ribbing and veiled insult with some requisite clumsy editorializing that Lee has to inject to remain down The scenes between the band members backstage and in rehearsal lack spark and are only surpassed in dreariness by the Bleek Giant conversations that have an ad lib look and go in circles Completing this travesty is Lee s pretentious visual style Tracking shots zooms and pans are wasted and without significance to scenes They just wander br br Blues is Lee s love letter to jazz made implicit by the mountains of memorabilia plastered all over the sets and it s all sentimental clap trap that lacks passion and verve Jazz on film is better served by Tavernier s Round Midnight and Eastwood s Bird which get below the surface reveal more sides of the form the pain behind it in addition to offering infinitely superior lead performances by Forrest Whitaker and the real deal Dexter Gordon This Spike Lee Joint doesn t even offer a mild buzz It s some pretty bad homegrown
There are two groups of people those who love every Fellini movie they see and normal people While I will admit that I have really enjoyed some of his films I can also honestly say that I can t stand some of them My opinion by the way is not just some knee jerk reaction I have seen most of Fellini s films and have also seen many films by the world s most famous directors With this in mind I feel that the most overrated and annoying directors can be both Godard and Fellini They both have delighted in the bizarre and often unwatchable and yet have received gobs of accolades from reviewers and the intelligensia while the average person would never sit through some of their films Heck even a person who loves international cinema would generally be left out in the cold when seeing some of these films So since only a small clique actually watches their films and they are already predisposed to seeing the directors as geniuses it s not surprising that their films are so often praised it s like a cult If you don t believe me think about many of Godard s films such as FIRST NAME CARMEN or ALPHAVILLE or what about FELLINI SATYRICON or JULIET OF THE SPIRITS These films abound with boredom weirdness and incomprehensibility Now I am NOT saying a film can t be weird after all I love HAPPINESS OF THE KATAKURIS and SHAOLIN SOCCER but it must be watchable br br Now on to this movie Somehow Fellini has managed to make a story about a sexually compulsive man completely boring and unsexy This is no small task it took a lot of work to make this so unwatchable Instead of cheap sexual thrills the sex acts are choreographed in a silly and annoying way while the character of Casanova is buried under so much makeup and prosthetics that Donald Sutherland looks like a ghoul I know some of this must have been Fellini s intention but many viewers will be left completely bored by this sterile performance especially since Sutherland s lines are all poorly dubbed into Italian and so he neither looks nor sounds like himself Unfortunately when the movie is not wrapped up in these boring sexual escapades there really isn t anything else to watch br br An interesting note about the first sexual conquest shown in this dull movie is that the actress looks amazingly like a younger version of Fellini s wife Giulietta Masina Considering that in addition to this that in previous decades Fellini had Masina play characters such as a prostitute and a horribly abused woman it seems like he may have truly hated his wife and was having this acted out on screen I read a bit about them and their tempestuous relationship and it seems to bear this out as well This is about the only aspect of this turgid film that I found at all interesting Don t say I didn t warn you
This is certainly one of the most bizarre films ever made even for Fellini About the only one more bizarre is his SATYRICON This is a two and a half hour romp through a strange nightmarish world of decadence opulence and sexual challenge Sutherland makes a curiously unappealing Casanova and the odd goings on in a series of unrelated vignettes taken from the great lover s autobiography fail to engage the viewer The art direction and costume design are however OUTSTANDING The Academy missed on not even nominating the former but did itself justice by rewarding an OSCAR for the latter Also nominated oddly was the disjointed pointless and almost inacessible screenplay Go figure The film on video is only 150 minutes 16 minutes short of the original running time This viewer was grateful
In a way this is the disaster Fellini has been working towards all his life The line between absurd masterpiece and free association bullshit is very small and what category a film will ultimately fit in will often just depend on personal feelings That said Casanova left me in cold admiration for its sets and little more that cannot be summed up more adequately by Bukowski br br Casanova died too just an old guy with a big cock and a long tongue and no guts at all to say that he lived well is true to say I could spit on his grave without feeling is also true the ladies usually go for the biggest fool they can find that is why the human race stands where it does today we have bred the clever and lasting Casanovas all hollow inside like the Easter bunnies we foster upon our poor children br br As far as I could make it out this is the position Fellini takes regarding his subject granted with more empathy but disgusted nonetheless br br Casanova s environment is made from decay and incestuous behavior themes Fellini dealt with more pointedly in Satyricon The succession of plot is characteristic of soft porn just without the coherence and Donald Sutherland is ugly and slimy to the point of distraction br br Yet there might just be a point in portraying Casanova as an unsightly fool And I challenge anybody to formulate this point without being obvious Fellini couldn t More than ever he seems here like a dirty old man a maestro for sure but one whose impulses satisfy himself more than anybody else I find it hard imagine an audience who enjoys this film It was a story not worth telling
I should explain why i gave this piece of art 1 star rating out of possible 10 Simply because it s hard or next to impossible to rate it unbiased probably it would have been the same if i had given it 10 10 explanations anyway would have followed br br I am not fond of these pointless gore movies like HOSTEL or so i think that s disgusting and pretty terrible in all the possible contextual meanings but as i found out after watching this movie there is a genre called historical drama and probably it would have been the case of 10 10 as it has plenty of it and Tarantino would have been more than happier with it and made Kill Bill 3 to spill even more blood on screen than here to show that it is possible but the thing about historical drama genre is that it s a sub category of the trash movies where John Romero is the undead gory emperor of the guts and so automatically it can t be rated as your default movie as these are movies that are made bad on purpose and you can t really tell whether the comically bad moment was meant to be so or it was simply bad it s for the people who like to enjoy bad acting bad screenplay and bad everything else And by some turn of faith i am one of them too there are days when i have an urge of seeing a really bad movie and look up for some trash and here you go the day is saved but that s definitely an opinion of mine and doesn t have match with anyones else br br What i wanted to say is that if you want to watch some terrible movie then Fellini s Casanova is definitely the choice but heed my advice and don t rate it by default means
1st watched 2 2 2003 4 out of 10 Dir Jim Kammerud Brian Smith Drab and un spectacular supposed sequel to the original classic animated 101 Dalmatians Yes the movie continues where it ended in the first one but the problem is that it plays out much like the original One of the great things about the original was the pacing of the story which this one doesn t have The animation is also very un spectacular for Disney and all we get is the same characters going thru the same kind of story all over again When is Disney going to stop boring us with sequels and re do s etc etc Probably when we stop renting or buying this mediocre fare that they have put out
I was very unimpressed with Cinderella 2 and Jungle Book 2 but this is possibly worse than both titles First of all I didn t like the animation very Saturday morning cartoon only worse in some scenes I liked some of the characters namely Thunderbolt and Patch but the other characters like Cruella were mediocre Cruella was truly villainous in the original but she lost her quality in the sequel What she said was nothing at all to write home about and her animation was kind of ugly Also her artist companion Lars was a joke to be honest with you and Roger seemed to have quit smoking overnight The voice talents were very good though especially Barry Bostwick as Thunderbolt with the exception of Jodi Benson the accent ruined it for me There were some good moments but the whole plot seemed bloated for me and highly suggestive of an extended TV episode All in all a hugely disappointing sequel to the most memorable of the 60s Disney movies along with Jungle Book Sorry I can only give this a 3 10 it just wasn t my cup of tea Bethany Cox
I mean the word pedestrian Seems the producers of the film forgot to have anything interesting happen Faith Domergue can do better than this She is supposed to be the mysterious vengeful Cobra goddess torn by love for Marshall Thompson there s an idea eh Instead she s a common would be housewife of the fifties and the single flat expression she wears throughout the film makes me think they shot it all in the early morning before Faith had her coffee As for the rest of the cast they are all so earnestly all American that the result is laughable This is ground more productively covered in Val Lewton in The Cat People I think Cult of the Cobra should really be titled Cult of the Contractual Obligation Why else would so many otherwise talented people sleepwalk their way though a slow moving predictable derivative failure like this
Faith Domergue better known as Dr Ruth in THIS ISLAND EARTH is the only reason to watch this film The story is very thin and once the Air Force buddies return to the States with a Cobra Curse upon them the action is just a waiting game See Faith the Snake Woman and try to pretend the rest isn t happening
Cult of the Cobra is now available on DVD in a pristine print that does full justice to whatever merits it has as a movie Unfortunately that is not saying much br br It has a competent cast of second rankers that acquit themselves as well as could be expected under the circumstances It is efficiently directed entirely on sound stages and standing sets on the studio backlot It looks OK but is ponderously over plotted and at a scant 80 minutes it is still heavily padded br br For example the double cobra attack on the first of the GIs was surely one attack too many br br The business about Julia choosing to marry Pete rather than Tom never amounts to anything Tom immediately falls in love with Lisa and she never has any reason to be jealous of Julia nor is she br br Julia s feminine intuition is introduced as if it is going to lead to an important plot development but it doesn t Similarly Pete s investigation into cobra cults and the suspicion that briefly falls on Tom serve no purpose other than to fill up screen time br br These are just symptoms of the underlying problem The movie is structured like a mystery but it isn t As soon as the curse is pronounced we know exactly where the story is heading so the characters are left painstakingly uncovering what we already know br br The ending is particularly lame Julia is menaced purely by accident Lisa has no reason to want to kill her she just happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time When Tom turns up in the nick of time to save her it is not even clear whether she was threatened at all He then simply disposes of the cobra in the way any of the previous victims might have done br br It is such an inconsequential little pipsqueak of a story that I found myself wondering how on earth it had been pitched to the studio heads Then it occurred to me Someone said Those Val Lewton movies were very successful over at RKO so why don t we make one like that br br Cult of the Cobra is clearly modelled on Cat People mysterious troubled shape shifting woman falls in love with the hero is apparently frigid kills people arouses the suspicions of the hero s woman friend and dies at the end But modelled on doesn t mean as good as by a wide margin It copies but doesn t understand what it is copying br br It is obviously trying for the low key suggestive Lewton style but this approach doesn t follow through into the story Lisa is no Irene She is meant to be strange and mysterious but there is no mystery about her We get a glimpse of her after the first attack in Asia so immediately recognise her when she turns up in New York There is never any doubt about her purpose Neither is there any ambiguity about whether of not she actually turns into a snake br br Then again during her nocturnal prowling we get not one but two attempts at buses Neither come off because the director doesn t understand what makes a bus work and in any case they happen to the stalker not the person being stalked br br These faint echoes of Cat People give Cult of the Cobra whatever small distinction it might have but they only draw attention to the yawning gulf between the original and the imitation br br Plagiarism may be the sincerest form of flattery but I doubt if Lewton or Tourneur were particularly flattered when this tepid little time passer came out
Six GIs about to be send home and discharged get drunk and sneak into a cult meeting in Asia Surrounded by hooded figures two male dancers pretend to have a fight Behind them on an altar a woven basket opens and a figure painted emerges and begins imitating a snake finally biting one of the dancers on the neck The imitation snake is dressed in some scaley looking body tights This is definitely a female imitation snake The cult member who has sneaked them into the secret meeting has warned the six men repeatedly that the ceremonies must not be interrupted and most definitely no photos must be taken or else they will be hunted down and killed Naturally the GIs take a flash photo send the cult members into an angry hysteria steal the basket containing the snake and run off with it into the Asian night br br One of the guys the most offensive and snarky dies from a cobra bite on the neck though no one can explain how the snake got into his hospital room br br Back in New York it all seems rather old news as the discharged men settle down into their civilian lives still maintaining their bond with one another Their jobs range from manager of a bowling alley David Janssen to graduate research student Richard Long James Dobson Jack Kelly and Marshall Thompson are also part of the neighborhood Richard Long has a nice blond girl friend Kelly is a somewhat reckless womanizer But they all get along well enough and all of them seem happy br br Then a dark shifty looking mysterious woman Faith Domergue shows up and Marshall Thompson takes a liking to her and insinuates her into the group br br Guess what happens First Janssen is terrified by a shadow in the back seat and dies in a car crash Then Kelly gets a visit from Domergue Something scares him so badly he tumbles through the window and dies in the fall to the sidewalk Long and Dobson begin to suspect what the viewer already knows that Domergue has had something to do with the deaths They also reckon that maybe she s turning into a cobra which is the case Dobson confronts her with his suspicions and she proves his point br br By this time Long and Thompson are thoroughly frazzled particularly Thompson who is in love with Domergue and has discovered that she is attracted to him too although he must explain to her what love is No matter A final reckless attack by the cobra woman against Long s girl friend not one of the six original offenders and Thompson must throw the snake out the window On the pavement below the body changes to that of Domergue The end br br I think I ll skip over most of the questions that the plot raises I ll just mention one of the more prosaic ones in passing Who paid for Domergue s fare from somewhere in Asia to New York Who s paying her utility bills in the hotel Who paid for her spectacular wardrobe How come she speaks American English so well What the hell s going on The writers and director have clearly seen some of Val Lewton s modest horror films and though not much effort has gone into this production they ve unashamedly stolen some gimmicks from Lewton In Lewton s The Cat People for instance the woman is transformed into a black leopard but with one tiny exception the threat is always kept in the shadows and is all the more spooky for it Most of the transformations here use shadows too but unlike Lewton s the shadows are clumsy and unambiguous br br Lewton also made occasional use of what he called buses Lewton s first bus was a literal one A potential victim is hurrying alone through the dark tunnels of Central Park with only the sound of footsteps Something or someone is following her She freezes with fright under a street lamp Something rustles the branches of the shrubs above her She looks upward There is a loud wheezing shriek that makes your hair stand on end It s a bus using its air brakes to stop for her The producers used at least two buses in this film and they amount to nothing A guy is walking distractedly across an intersection for instance and there is the sudden rumble of a truck that almost hits him There is no set up to the shot It s jammed in with a shoe horn br br I don t much care for movies that perpetuate the stereotype of serpents as slimy ugly venomous and phallic As a matter of fact no snakes are slimy most are harmless and many are extraordinarily beautiful Furthermore they re more feminine than masculine in their sinuous movements and serpentine approach to goals You want a reptilian symbol for masculinity Try a six lined racerunner It s a really fast lizard When it sees something to eat it rushes up and gobbles it down br br Anyway if you want to see some fine low budget scary films don t bother with this one Find The Cat People or one of Lewton s other minor masterpieces of which this is an obvious copy
Actually this is a lie Shrek 3 D was actually the first 3d animated movie I bought it on DVD about 3 years ago Didn t Bug s Life also do that I think it was at Disneyworld in that tree so I m saying before they go and use that as there logo Also Shrek 3d was a motion simulator at Universal Studios They should still consider it as a movie because it appeared in a theater and you could buy it for DVD The movie was cute at least the little flyes were I liked IQ I agree with animaster they did a god job out of making a movie out of something that is just a out and back adventure I recommend it to families and kids
As long as there s been 3d technology 1950 s I think there s been animation made for it I remember specifically a Donald Duck cartoon with Chip and Dale in it I don t remember the name at the moment but the plot was that Donald worked at a circus was feeding an elephant peanuts and Chip and Dale were stealing the peanuts This was made to watch in 3d probably 1960 s If you happened to watch Meet the Robinsons in 3d in theaters they showed this cartoon before the movie and explained the details of it s origin There are probably somewhere around 100 cartoons made specifically to be viewed through 3d glasses This claim was a bad move because it s not difficult to prove them wrong On top of that this just looks like a bad movie
With the MASSIVE advertising this is getting on Nickelodeon and Nick Jr and that ilk my son was bugging us to see it Between DVD and the theaters I ve seen pretty much everything by now from the outstanding Incredibles Shrek to the really bad Wall E Brother Bear But this was easily the worst movie I ve ever seen kids or no kids It was a when it this stupid thing going to end kind of experience OK it s aimed at toddlers or it better be it s insulting to the intelligence of anyone over 3 but I ve never seen something so predictable repetitive and slow moving Then once you re finally fed up but relieved that the movie is over there is this bizarre thing at the end that you think is the setup for a joke but there isn t one it s serious though it s hard to tell what they re trying to accomplish The 3 D effects yeah if you ve never seen a Viewmaster they re a big deal otherwise no if you look at the screen without glasses it appears to be the same process Even my son was bored by the end Both my wife and I looked at each other and said wow at the end Bad in every respect
this is what you would get if you allowed a 10 year old manic American to write a story of a moon trip Absolute garbage with no redeeming qualities Maybe it held some fascination in the 3D dept but as a narrative and entertaining animation it held nothing to make wasting an hour and a half worth while Save your time and money and watch BOLT instead br br Damn Not enough lines yet I feel that sums it up well I agree with an above review this is like a cold war propaganda story Maybe it would have been more interesting if they had made it about the flies uncovering the hoax of the moon landing or if the flies had died in the first minute BTW why were all the main character flies deformed not one had the full compliment of limbs
Today I visited an Athenean Cinema with my two kids 6 8 years old payed 3 x 12 euros about 45 US total not to mention gas popcorn soda was asked to return my 3d special glasses after leaving the theater and was forced to watch what could have been a great 3d movie masterpiece but only proved to be a sick cold war like propaganda movie like none I have seen during the last 20 years AND THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE A MOVIE FOR CHILDREN IN HEAVEN S NAME br br PS 1 The average working Greek makes no more than 850 Euros a month approxiamtely 1050 US br br PS 2 My kids liked it but then again they are no more than babies in Greek mora morons like the one who wrote the script the others who made this 3d disgrace happen br br PS 3 3D animation is fantastic but who gives a
I also having endured hundreds of children s movies in the past consider this to be one of the worst I have ever seen br br 1 I resent in this day and age having to explain to my children that Russia is not the bad guys Also that mocking Russian names like Poopchev is inappropriate br br 2 The grandfather fly s birthday party scene contained a quasi sexist joke in which he implied that males drink beer and women talk on the phone Two other flies also needlessly use the word crap twice br br 3 The whole movie largely smacks of 1950 s stereotypes and propaganda that I thought we as a nation were proud to have risen above br br In all it s just crude badly animated even more badly written and not worth wasting the time to view
Nat voiced by Trevor Gagnon along with his brainiac friend IQ voiced by Philip Bolden and the always hungry Scooter David Gore are kids with big dreams They want to be the first flies in space And what encourages their dreams is the first spacecraft to land on the moon the Apollo 11 is waiting for its historic trip on the launch pad near where the three hang out br br The first thing you notice is the animation of the film I found it done very well done The scenery had depth to it as things in the distance actually looked like they were behind the focus of the scenes I didn t see the movie in 3 D as it was broadcast on HBO However I could see that there really wasn t any scenes which took advantage of the 3 D effects except a fight between characters near the end I also wasn t really impressed with the design of the characters To me they didn t look like anything resembling a fly especially in the coloring The flies were an unusual blue gray that was kind of distracting to me br br The performances from the cast was not bad but it wasn t good either There were many times I focused more on my computer than the story The writing was certainly written for a younger audience with comedic moments that will make younger kids laugh I saw nothing for adults like jokes that they ll get the punchline for the adults to understand the meaning br br History was not followed in this film In fact I think it was completely ignored as the main focus was the flies I also hated when a well known astronaut popped up on the screen and explained that the stories about the flies in the film was a work of fiction and no flies were on Apollo 11 I did like how he thanked the men and women who sacrificed their lives for space exploration though br br If you are an adult this is not for you It was not made for the entire family This is certainly just for kids But save this one for a rainy day
This is not a good movie Too preachy in parts and the story line was sub par The 3D was OK but not superb I almost fell asleep in this movie br br The story is about 3 young flies that want to have adventure and follow up on it The characters are lacking I truly do not care about these characters and feel that there was nothing to keep an adult interested Pixar this is not br br I would have liked to see more special 3D effects Also I wold like to see more fly jokes than the mom constantly saying Lord of the flies Pretty sexist in showing the women as house wives and fainting
1st the good news The 3 D is spectacularly well done and they don t go for the gotcha gimmicks The film is based on the true story of the high point in human history and even features one of the actual participants in that story Buzz Aldrin br br And now the meat of the matter It s about FLIES for krissakes Flies with big googy human eyes true but flies nonetheless Remember when I likened the Underworld movies to rats vs cockroaches That wasn t intended as praise and I never dreamed anyone would take it literally This one s got even less empathy going for it Baby maggots Ugh In one of those odd confluences of Hollywood groupthink this flik was evidently on the drawing boards at the same time as Space Chimps also about critters in space br br Go rent Apollo 13 and see a 9 rated movie about the REAL space program RIP
When I saw this trailer on TV I was surprised In May of 2008 I was at Six Flags in New Jersey and this was showing at a 4 D attraction you know the attraction that the seats move I take it that the version I saw was a shortened version 15 min and also re created to add the motion effects It was a cute movie but that was it It was educational and told about the first mission but the ending of a CGI spacewalk seemed a bit well trite I was not a big fan of the movie but i would recommend this movie for any parent wanting to inform their children in a fun way about the first moonwalk I will say the character actors were well selected and the characters themselves were cute So all in all I would say if you want to bring the younger kids go for it But if you are wanting to take your older kids take them to another movie they will thank you
While the 3 D animation the highlight of the show did it s job well most other elements fell flat It was as though the filmmakers thought well it s gonna be 3 D so we don t have to work that hard on the plot or character development And the fact that it s a children s movie is absolutely no excuse The public is drawn to three dimensional characters Shrek Nemo s Dad just as much as they are drawn to three dimensional graphics The only dimension any of the main characters showed was two dimensional Scooter who twists the plot from time to time with his compulsion to eat everything in sight br br And the absolute kicker Buzz Aldrin s appearance at the very end after watching a very robotic cartoon version of the same historical figure for an hour and half comes on the screen and ruins everyone s good time by calling the film s main characters contaminants and announcing that the situation put forth on screen was actually an impossibility br br Did you just wanna tell the kids the Easter Bunny and Santa Claus don t exist while you re at it
Okay so someone somewhere a few years ago thought it would be a good idea to make a 3D IMAX movie about some flies stowing away aboard the Apollo 11 and going to the moon So they did Someone somewhere was an idiot br br I want to give the artists props for doing their homework on the hardware As far as I can tell the rockets and the launch hardware were bang on The graphics in general were pretty good the rocket launch gave me chills like a good rocket launch always does my Popular Mechanics flying car gearhead blood still runs strong and the 3D was pretty effective The CG wasn t Pixar quality but it was generally good The flies were kinda mediocre anthropomorphics with some half assed late 60s characters thrown in for colour hippie flies African American flies with giant afros and black shades etc and the maggots looked more like grubs with human baby heads although they made suitably gross squelching noises br br The scriptwriters certainly did not do their homework relying on offensive and outdated clichés 60s gender politics including mostly useless female characters racial stereotypes evil Russians a fat fly who only wants to eat grade two level gross out humour In a movie aimed for IMAX they blew a wonderful opportunity to sneak in some educational content about physics and space travel they didn t get their physics right zero g in the Lunar Module during landing burn PLEASE They couldn t even be bothered to read the original radio transcripts between Houston and the astronauts all of which is in the public domain instead they wrote their own dialogue which sounds like crap br br But we liked the maggots br br So they get a point and a half for rockets and maggots Uh yay 1 5 5
It is pretty surreal what these flies can do eh well this is a cartoon so anything can happen in it br br At first I must tell you that I love animated movies Unfortunately this year s repertoire is very weak This cartoon is nothing but a list of flaws br br 1 I quoted the tag line It suggests that this movie has great 3D effects Well I did not see any at least not something special I never saw before br br 2 The flies in this movie look nothing like real flies At least they could ve make them black But cyan flies seriously With giant heads and slim torsos br br 3 The story I guess it was written for 6 year old kids I could tell it in two sentences it is so over simplified br br 4 Excessive patriotism For example They are American files after all Oh give me a break
Fly Me To The Moon has to be the worst animated film I ve seen in a LONG TIME That s saying something since I have taken my son to see every animated release for the last 4 years now The story is to be generous trite The voice acting is atrocious Too cute sounding The humor is of the Romper Room variety The animation is passable for a Nickolodeon type of cartoon but this is being released on the big screen not cable television br br It gets a 2 only because of it s OK 3 D visuals Some of the scenes had a mildly stimulating image but We ve seen much better in the past I also question the insistence of the filmmakers to have characters fly away from the screen rather than into it in most of the scenes While that is interesting at first it became tiresome after the 3rd or 4th time It seemed to smack of indifference to me on the part of the creators br br I will say this though It had a pretty cool soundtrack And for the record my son wasn t too crazy about it either Bad movie
This movie was advertised on radio television magazines etc Almost every hour or every issue So when we went to the Kinnepolis multiplex our expectations were very high But oh boy how sad this movie is It is a movie in Hollywood style about a movie in a movie Shades shows so clear we aren t ready to produce big Hollywood movies I am not a movie critic but I think a good movie starts with a good script And the script is a nightmare Like my subject line says it is nothing and then looped You could just stare to the television as well without really seeing anything That was the feeling we ve got when we saw Shades Shades is a BAD PRODUCTION
The first ten minutes of this movie about making an international movie in Belgium are fine you see real chaos on the set a producer on the edge of a nervous breakdown the cool has been director Mickey Rourke the bad tempered star etc You have seen everything before but it s well done BUT THEN The rest of the time the film just repeats itself the same ten minutes over and over again No climax no dramatic development no good acting not even bad acting it just goes on and on and on Mickey Rourke has two good minutes when his character talks about his f ked up career in a scene where reality and fiction meet Altogether that makes 12 good minutes br br
This is a very sad movie Really Nothing happens in this movie The Script is bad I guess they ve just copy paste the first 15 pages to 90 pages The Producers must have thought let s create a Hollywood movie here in Belgium They didn t succeed Now in the third week it is only running in Antwerp and Brussels at 22h45 or something In the past we have had really good movies in Belgium like Daens Shades is a waste of your time Maybe you could sneak in the theater after you ve seen a real movie If you ve seen 10 minutes of Shades you ve seen it all It was advertised to death on local radio and TV I hope it will disappear in the Shades soon
The first and only time I saw Shades was during a Sneakpreview It hadn t even been in premiere I remember there was someone of the directors staff there don t even remember who It was a Belgian movie we never heard of it so we were quite neutral not knowing what to expect Mickey Rourke is a brilliant actor and he s stands miles ahead all the rest He plays an actor who s star has long stopped rising He s helping to realise a movie in Belgium entitled Shades br br As soon as the movie started we noticed how much swearing there is Nothing against the occasional swear word However this was way beyond annoying Whenever Rourke uses the F word to express something it comes naturally However when someone from the cast a non English speaker uses the F or S word it becomes arrogant and aggressive br br We quickly lost count of how many times they used the F and S words Everybody was just glad to be out of the theatre And we had to give a vote but it was hard for us because it was only from 0 to 10 and we were looking for the 10
Greg Davis and Bryan Daly take some crazed statements by a terrorists add some commentary by a bunch of uber right reactionaries ascribe the most extreme positions of the most fundamentalist Moslems on the planet to everyone who calls themselves a Moslem and presents this as the theology of Islam Maybe their next film will involve interviewing Fred Phelps and the congregation of the Westboro Baptist Church adding commentary by some militant atheist scholars and call their film What the World Needs to Know About Christianity Ultimately this film suffers from both poor production values and lack of attention to the most basic standards of journalism Don t waste your time and money just turn on your AM radio and listen to Rush Limbaugh for a couple of days for free and you ll get the same message with the same level of intellectual analysis
This film was more effective in persuading me of a Zionist conspiracy than a Muslim one And I m Jewish br br Anbody go to journalism school Read an editorial Freshman year rhetoric These alarmist assertions presented in a palatable way might prove persuasive But by offering no acknowledgment of possible opposing arguments nor viable or any at all solutions few sources and each of dubious origin makes the argument an ineffectual diatribe br br And thank goodness for that I wouldn t want anyone to leave the theatre BELIEVING any of this racist claptrap br br A good lesson for me and hopefully a cautionary tale for you to actually read about a film before seeing it
That s pretty ridiculous I hope many people are exposed to Muslims who live all over the U S U k and all over the world The religion has over a billion followers I Myself born and bread in America and through my religious classes and teachings I have been taught to cherish my country and work to contribute to the society I am very dedicated to the followings and teachings of my religion have been stressed through out life to educate and prepare oneself for success through education in order to contribute back to the world I have know many Muslims from all over and I have traveled to countries like Pakistan I have yet to meet one person who believes that we should hurt anyone or not accept any other religion except from the people in the media I wonder why Also its sad that these extremists are the ones the media use to represent a whole religion Its a religion of one billion people and these are less than one percent I am sure the other people of other religions would not like to be represented by the KKK IRA and many more which are simple small percentage extremists who use outdated and not literal passages from the respected books in order to pursue their own revenge personal or business matters through their so called religion
This video contains an outsmart way to confuse and manipulate Americans about Islam It s a pity that the people who did it really believe that American people is so dumb to believe in it perhaps as an American citizen every person must protest against this kind of crap If you want to know the truth about Islam don t let nobody tell you THE QURAN IS PUBLIC you can read it by yourself and decide if what they say it s true or false br br The video uses a lot of audiovisual strategies directed to manipulate and associate things that are not even related The music used at some points prepare the public to hate what they see even if they don t really understand what s going on in there They use images that are misplaced from their original content br br To end the comment I would like to make a reflexion Don t you think you can do the same exact movie with every religion in the world
The documentary and we use that term loosely apparently summarizes that Muslims are trying to violently take over the world Then states that any Muslim that doesn t admit this is either ignorant of their own faith or lying to your face Also every person that is interviewed in the film has found a market for their ludicrous take on reality by selling claptrap to conservatives willing to let others do the thinking for them What the West NEEDS to know is this is nothing more than propaganda aimed at mental midgets If you are looking for an actual documentary on Islam and the current state of the Middle East I would look elsewhere Try something that provides multiple points of view from qualified sources
I have been using IMDb for years and I never wanted to get involved in the commentary of movies until now This documentary has so many problems that I hardly know what to say I am not a Muslim nor am I an Islamic studies expert but I know enough to shed some light on the obvious one sided viewpoint that this documentary espouses br br The problems with this movie begin with the fact that it is a documentary Most of the documentaries that I have seen anchor themselves around a few valid points and then surround those points with debatable interpretations and misinformation This is certainly the case with Islam What the West Needs to Know Yes there are fundamentalists around the world and some of them are Muslim but to build a documentary about all of Islam around a small percentage of radicalized people is incredibly misleading This is really a documentary about the fundamentalist aspects of Islam and nothing more br br For those who would like to more objectively explore some of the issues raised in this documentary here are several points that may help br br There was nothing positive about Islam presented in the documentary br br The documentary focuses on the Middle East but more Muslims live outside of that region More Muslims live in China believe it or not than in Saudi Arabia About 40 of all Muslims live in Pakistan Bangladesh India and Indonesia br br The translation of the Qur an used in the documentary is a questionable one I watched the documentary while viewing another translation and the differences were striking I had been warned about the translation that was used in the documentary and now I know why Surrah 98 6 is a good example The documentary suggests that the Surrah says that disbelievers will go to hell But the translation I have reads instead Those who reject Truth among the People of the Book and among the Polytheists will be in hellfire The difference is that those who reject Truth are those people who know about God and the Truth of God and decide to reject it anyways br br The movie mentioned that there is no morality inherent in Islam but this is not true Although it is true that much comes from the Qur an and Hadith Islam also recognizes a concept called Urf or normative behavior Obviously what is normative can be interpreted many ways but Urf is meant to be good behavior what an average person would consider right or wrong br br The documentary presents Shar ia Islamic Law as being one unified body of knowledge that all Muslims follow This is simply not true There are many Islamic schools of law and they range from progressive and modernist to fundamentalist in the way they interpret law br br The Hadith tradition is similar There are thousands of Hadith and each school of law accepts some and rejects others Using the Hadith without serious scholarship to determine which ones are accurate real and applicable is indiscriminately picking and choosing quotations from history that fit what you want to say which is what the documentary did br br What I hope people realize is that fundamentalism is the problem not Islam or any other religion Christianity has fundamentalists that shoot abortion clinic doctors and so on I know this is not the same as suicide bombing just understand that the righteousness of fundamentalism is arguably the problem If you feel you have THE answer then everyone else must be wrong But if you feel you have AN answer you can work together with other people s views about politics religion God or whatever
It is not obvious from viewing this film so I recommend viewers research the people who present their case in it but this presentation on the realities of Islam and its encouragement of violence and intolerance against all non Muslims is lacking objectiveness and also completely fails to factor in the human condition It is one thing to document that the Koran says many things about how a devout Muslim is required to interact with non Muslims but any realist is able to realize that not every human who feels himself or herself to be a follower of Islam will agree with and comply with all tenets of that faith and system There is reason to call much about the presenters into question such that viewers need to see the presentation with a healthy skepticism don t swallow it all hook line and sinker without some thinking of your own br br One specific for instance is researching the person Walid Shoebat who claims to be a former Muslim who perpetrated an act of terrorism in Bethlehem There are many wise people in the world who believe neither of these assertions I am not nor have I ever been a Muslim I have never read the Koran I am not a Christian nor a member of _any_ faith But I am an intelligent and discerning human While the film is quite disturbing in its presentation of how SOME Muslims view their obligation to Islam I remind you that there is more to Islam than the views of the fundamentalists Just as their are fundamentalists and evangelical Christians so too there are variations in the intensity of belief and obligation among Jews and Muslims br br When you watch this film you need to have the salt shaker on hand One grain will not be enough you ll need more Please use your own mind and think for yourself research what is presented and evaluate the state of the world and how Islam fits within it based on more than what is said in 98 minutes of video There is a common thread of political affiliation among those who put this film together indicating a definite bias Be your own brain
I couldn t relate to this film It failed to engage me either intellectually emotionally or aesthetically The dialogue was very dense and uninvolving I couldn t connect with and hence care about any of the characters and I m finding it hard to find much that s positive to say about it br br I ve read that to understand it properly one needs to be familiar with some of the more obscure aspects of Catholic theology I ll admit that as an atheist I probably am unfamiliar with many of the finer details of Catholicism but I have also seen many films dealing with religious issues that have touched me because their themes are still universal to the human condition and don t rely on specialised knowledge or beliefs
You talking to Me 1987 is a pretty bad movie starring some dude who I have never seen before or since starring as a guy from the neighborhood who tries to become an actor He has a heavy jones for Taxi Driver as tries to use that shtick to make it big When he learns the hard facts of life he does what everyone else does changes his image He goes from good fella to a surf s up dude over night His friend can t believe the change but he scores with Faith Ford and get s a cool paying gig Can this young punk keep his street cred whilst making it big br br This is a real lame movie that tries too hard to incorporate too many things at once An interesting idea that falls apart due to poor execution Who knows maybe somebody will pick up the ball and run because the film makers fumbled the ball this time br br Don t waste your time with this movie Unless you want to see a hot Faith Ford and a young Bubba from Forest Gump br br xx
Despite the gravity of the subject and probably the good intentions of the filmmakers to make a film addressing white supremacy the inconsistencies of its main character Bronson Green aspiring New York actor easily turned L A phony makes it hard to take the story seriously Green who is constantly rejected by Los Angeles casting agents for being obsolete i e too New York when the 80s is looking for big blonde and dumb he finds success comes easily when he s willing to succumb to falsifying his image Unfortunately the new hair dye and pacified surfer attitude lands him an acting opportunity with the Jericho Church which subscribes white supremacist teaching of the Aryan nation Green is willing to easily forget his past and particularly turning his back on his young black friend of ten years in order to be the Church s new spokesman This makes no sense seeing as how principled our character initially is It is this sudden and loose change in character coupled with an abrupt reversion back to the hardened DeNiro obsessed as his Taxi Driver character form who is able to battle the villains A noble attempt on the filmmakers but one that ultimately reveals itself as anything but serious br br The other characters too are quite annoying and what we are forced to recognize in them comes too easily the psychotic paranoia of the Church leader the self interested actress girlfriend the first girlfriend Bronson has when he s in L A and the new blonde girlfriend who s character lacks so much development she is for the most part just a walking talking void We are just supposed to see them in fleeting moments in which something random forces us to draw assumptions about the characters But there is really little development of any of them br br The other problem with this film is the ungodly amount of time the characters are involved in very little important action Much of the beginning concerns introducing the characters obviously and later we see Bronson s difficulties with breaking into the L A acting scene and the frustrations which stem from constant rejection But after he does willingly change his looks and personality in order to become accepted there is at least a good twenty minutes to thirty minutes of wasted film in which very little of anything happens br br For films that seek to draw attention to the irrational fears behind racism this was not one done with enough credibility
ok for starters taxi driver is amazing this this is not taxi driver or amazing what it is is bad but i thought it was bad funny which means that it did have some redeeming qualities like the dialogue wow there was more or less no plot the characters were all stupid and the movie was preachy there were some places were i thought the movie would dive into taxi driver type violence which would have hit the message at the end of the movie on the head much harder i can t even believe that there are like 20 other people who have seen this movie yeah it s worth watching if you are real bored and you want to reaffirm the fact that anyone can make a movie or at least can try to
The dudes at MST3K should see this dog of a film It s basically about a dopey hack actor in Hollywood who can t land any acting gigs And he has this strange obsession with the movie Taxi Driver So what does this dumb actor do He dyes his hair blonde and starts acting like a L A surfer dude in the naive hope this will get him acting roles You ll laugh yer head off at so many of this movie s inadvertently funny scenes Like when the actor dude s girlfriend is heart broken and sobbing and saying lines like How could you do this to me And why is she crying Cos he dyed his hair blonde and became a surfer dude to get acting gigs This movie makes no sense at ALL The actor who played the governor on Benson is in this too and he plays a stereotypical right wing politician with lotsa dumb funny dialog This movie will crack you up trust me You talking to me
When I first saw a small scene of it in some announcements I thought the show would be entertaining to watch The little robot guy does look kinda cute The style of animation does look sort of familiar to some classic shows Before the show aired I studied it through some sources There I did became slightly dismayed The three children Tommy Gus and Lola are voiced appropriately but Robotboy is an exception It would have been a lot nicer if he were to be portrayed by a young lad One good example is Robot Jones a robot character from Whatever Happened To Robot Jones The show isn t bad really But the way Robotboy is inappropriately portrayed is my only criticism Thus I don t watch it much
When I first watched Robotboy I found it fresh and interesting but then I noticed that with each episode this show is trying to teach you how to behave yourself what is good bad Episodes became predictable And main characters are not interesting Again we see a hyper smart boy beaten by his older brother parents who don t understand their kid and his friends girl and fat boy Also this show has no logic A super modern robot who works on two AA size batteries and can use a lot of weapons But the biggest problem is the difference between activated and super activated modes We see two different robots and it declines main idea of the show Robot must learn how to behave himself in human society
Now I like sci fi cartoons However when Robotboy appeared in Canada in late 2006 I watched the premiere and was inevitably appalled The characters are generic and stereotypical Do they REALLY need to make an African American man wear tiger stripe print clothing and speak in a Jamacian accent WHY are all the Asian characters vibrant yellow and squinting Does the mother HAVE to have big thighs and chest and constantly complain to the point where things become unrealistic predictable gross and sometimes disturbing There are heavy similarities to even stabs at Astro Boy Allow me to explain dub names for the young Robotboy Astro Kamikaze Tenma Constantine Shadow Gus Abercrombie Tommy Alejo Lola Zoran Kennedy Moshimo O Shay and it so on Brief resemblances to My Life As A Teenage Robot Star Wars Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Kamen Riders Sailor Moon and co are afoot Not to mention the abundant racial gender stereotyping Don t even get me started on the innuendos I ll just say they re hidden and quite dirty But seriously Don t even try watching this Especially if you like Astro Boy
Anyone notice that Tommy only has 3 facial expressions br br 1 The angry eyes look he gives every enemy 2 The holding of the hands to face mouth agape and frightened eyes 3 The smiling Tommy Turnbull br br I have to say that i pretty much hate this show i don t watch it but it s like Code Lyoko we ve all watched at least one i must say that this show is borderline racist uninteresting and pointless br br every episode ends with robotboy winning except for one exception when robotboy basically let this overly geeky freakazoid fly away on a jetpack br br The jokes are pretty crude too i think it s mostly people saying the word Suck or farting i think the bullies of the show are quite shocking too br br Isn t there one that hides a bowling ball under his hate and the other uses a chain for god sake what kind of school is he going to Not to mention his older brother who is borderline psychopathic and has no other character qualities br br The whole show i feel is ripping off megas XLR and Fosters Like you could say the trio of coop jamie and Kiva as well as Robotboy being similar to Megas where he beats everyone no matter what the odds and he s free spirited despite being a robot br br There is simply no appeal to this show i m surprised that it s still running
This is a truly awful B movie It is witless and often embarrassing The plot the basic making into show business routine is almost nonexistent In fact the film is merely an excuse to push the war effort and highlight some popular music groups of 1942 including the Mills Brothers Count Basie Duke Ellington Bob Crosby and Freddy Slack Each group gets about the standard three minutes the exception being the Mills Brothers who for some reason warranted two numbers Ann Miller doesn t get to dance until the last couple of minutes of the film and she has little to do but strut her stuff amid a barrage of patriotic propaganda br br The most interesting moment in the film in my view occurred in the Duke Ellington segment The band appears to be playing in a train standing in awkward positions In the deep South at the time the band was segregated in railroad cars when traveling Johnny Hodges is seen next to Duke and Harry Carney may also be identified In the last moments of the film trumpeter violinist Ray Nance rushes down the aisle to the camera and does an uncle Tom bugging his eyes and wiggling his head the way Willy Best did in many films For modern viewers especially jazz fans this homage to segregation is sad indeed Some movies go best unseen
From around the time Europe began fighting World War II until the war s end Hollywood with significant prodding from the government made tons of movies which were designed to try and get young men to enlist in the Army by making the life of a serviceman appear cool This is by far the sloppiest implying that the life of a soldier is devoid of work you get the best food and you get to lie around all day listening to Ann Miller on the radio I am far too young to have participated in WWII but I think that there was more to it than that There is the barest cat s whisker of a plot and a bunch of musical numbers featuring some of the day s leading acts br br I think that by 1943 even the most naive of civvies knew that there was more going on overseas than the wacky hijinks portrayed in this movie While I am sure that it was meant to be viewed as escapist entertainment I can t help but wonder if the family and loved ones of men fighting in the war were amused or repulsed by this trivialization of their loved ones sacrifice
Before I start let me say that my experience of this movie might have been influenced by the dubbing which I gather from other comments was the original one which is considered inferior by some So it is entirely possible that subtitles or the apparently new DVD version would make a difference I have also not read the corresponding book I m only familiar with one other Japanese manga and might be lacking cultural context br br Potential minor spoilers ahead br br I usually like darkly tinged science fiction stories the likes of Blade Runner 12 Monkeys etc but I did not enjoy this movie at all While it started out mildly intriguing it became tedious by the time it was only half way finished There are all sorts of problems let s start with what is probably the most severe the dialogue The characters seem unable to formulate complete sentences if they aren t shouting each other s names for the n th time they are usually grunting monosyllables Kanedaaa Tetsuoooo Huh Grrr etc This leaves most of the characters entirely underdeveloped and two dimensional It doesn t help in the least that a lot of them get only a few minutes of screen time without anything interesting to say that would develop them away from the stereotypes suggested by the visuals br br The grunting is augmented by some random pseudo philosophical technobabble that sounds vague and uninspired even by Star Trek standards There is nothing deep and meaningful here it all seems haphazard thrown together at random from various bits and pieces of stock sci fi ideas with no coherency whatsoever br br What little there is of an intelligible plot is no more than an excuse to begin the overlong final sequence which consists of escalating scenes of mayhem and destruction Not that there s anything wrong with a nice bit of mayhem and destruction of course but in this case you ll find yourself asking what s the point of it all and how long until it s over Character development in the last 30 minutes or so consists of little more than Tetsuo turning into Pizza the Hutt for no readily apparent reason br br The ending resembles the one in 2001 a bizarre string of images that far from resolving or explaining anything leave the viewer feeling he s just been looking into a kaleidoscope for two hours I m sure some will claim that this sort of thing is art but to me it was just a lot of admittedly imaginative use of colour and shapes Some of the music was also quite interesting Unfortunately it s all style and no substance br br Tired of Disney Want to watch animated movies dealing intelligently with adult themes I m sad to say you re more likely to find that sort of thing in South Park
One of those Thank God I don t live there documentaries This one tells of two warring factions in Colombia guerrillas and paramilitaries and the surrounding peoples of Medellin br br Guns drugs and death run rampant The guys no older than 22 not in the middle of fighting a war are in jail The girls not women girls always react the same way when one of them is killed with tears and screaming You scratch your head what did they expect really I don t know what s more disturbing the nightly shoot outs and civil unrest or that everybody just seems to passively accept things as are Or seeing that boy drinking what is obviously not his first beer being all of what 10 If you were to take these any of these young men out of their situation and put them some place where they had the opportunity to do more be more how many would choose not to stay br br Based on this documentary all I m afraid
Medellin is a fabulous place to live work and study I ve been there twice and never did I hear anything about guerrilla activities paramilitaries taking tourists hostage or anything of the sort There are invisible police but it is not a Big Brother system There are just enough police so that they are visible in everyday life but they do not hassle someone without good reasons br br La Sierra is an interesting documentary in that the youths it depicts in the movie essentially become its characters The directors of the movie carefully carve out plot lines among the daily actions of the inhabitants of La Sierra and when a character dies there is genuine pathos It is difficult to imagine however that the three youths are all members of the Bloque Metro a gang that used to terrorize La Sierra before the Colombian government began to restructure the country br br La Sierra is not an accurate depiction of life in Colombia there are of course things to be wary of such as petty crime but when one considers pickpocketing happens in modern cities such as London New York or Tokyo Colombia doesn t seem that different after all Colombians are eagerly awaiting their chance to show to the world that the once war torn country is now prospering more than ever
This story is about the romantic triangle between a nth African male prostitute a French transsexual prostitute Stephanie and a Russian waiter who speaks no French and never seems to shave br br As a film it is dull dreary and depressing shot either on foggy overcast winter days or in badly lit interiors where everyone is bathed in a weird blue luminescence And yes I know it s because the white balance was out Everyone is pale and downcast and looks haggard shabby and dirty Bodies are bony and shot in such closeup that they look quite ugly and unappealing Moles greasy hair Yuk Bad news in a film where people spend a lot of time either naked or having sex br br And the story Well Stephanie s mother is dying All three characters go back to Stephanie s home village where through a bunch of flashbacks to desolate countryside and predictably dingy interiors we see a bit of Stephanie s childhood as a boy called Pierre The mother dies Well and that s about it really Character development is kept to a minimum as is the denouement of the story br br I suppose the storyline is not linear it would explain a lot of non sequiteurs but really after paying my seven euros I don t feel like having to construct the film myself that s what the director takes my money for To expect me to join the story telling process and get my hands dirty so to speak is asking way too much br br This film is a heap of pretentious rubbish made above all from a desire to epater les bourgeois ie shock the straights I can see how it was a shoo in for the Berlin Film Festival and I can see why it got nowhere
If you like films that ramble with little plot exposition spiced with kinky sex this film is for you On the plus side the lead actor actress newcomer transsexual does have an interesting screen presence but not enough to add up to much more than a mildly interesting movie if that Essentially this film is about 3 social outcasts transexual prostitute male hustler and Russian gay immigrant who somehow have developed a bond Why is not clear We are expected to accept these misfits are at the core basic honest people who have the ability to love while they hustle their bodies on the street Right And Anna Nicole Smith was truly in love with her ninety something sugar daddy The filmmaker shows a gritty unpleasant side of life while wanting us to believe underneath it all these seriously damaged people are really quite normal to the extent they have a menage a trois which helps them through life Quite a fantasy but unfortunately portrayed here as real look of life on the wild side In sum no plot no truth and no real reason to spend much time here Unless of course you just like to revel in the kink
This isn t a movie It is a collection of unrelated ill conceived and poorly assembled scenes that look like the unedited results of a dim 10 year old with a mini DV camera In fact I have a theory that the extremely abrasive girl in the train corridor the one with the greasy hair dead pan stare ipod and nervous tic probably shot it herself in a creative phase br br If you made it further than the ten minutes I did don t bother trying to fit what you saw into the context of the European Artiste mentality praised above This is a true and complete waste of time money and film that would have made William One Shot Beaudine cringe br br The unfortunate part is that the endless series of vacuum packed characters is representative of what now passes for much of humanity br br What s next Six directors shooting social intercourse at the Wal Mart snack counter
When I first started watching this movie I was looking for some kind of subtle metaphors but it soon dawned on me that this movie was indeed about people on a train The interactions between people are like those you can see any day on the street and when in occasion there is a slightly more interesting situation the dialogue becomes stilted and boring Its not that I don t get how this film is trying to portray the way people interact it s just that in this film they are very boring If you want to see and analyse these kinds of relationships you d be best to actually go out and buy a train ticket and look at the people on the train with you It is realistic but you wouldn t go to a movie to watch a film about you sitting there watching the movie
For years I remember reading about this show Trouble With Tracy in the TV Guide CFTO TV Toronto every Saturday morning at 6 am I lived about a two hour drive north of Toronto and we couldn t get CFTO but you know how it is we always want what we can t have br br Well I knew what I wanted and what I wanted was to see what this Trouble With Tracy was all about Did it have a beautiful girl in the starring role Was there nudity Was there suspense Was it a comedy It would ve been fine if there was some promotion of the show At least I could ve known what I was missing But NO The mystery drove me bonkers until CTV affiliate CKCO built a re transmitter in Wiarton Ontario and began to broadcast Trouble With Tracy at the same time as CFTO Saturday mornings at 6 am One Saturday morning I got up and turned the TV on at 5 59 and at last I got to see what The Trouble With Tracy was Yes the Trouble With Tracy was that it was Canadian content and stuck in the harmless 6 am spot so no one would ever see how awful it was br br Talented Canadian Actor Steve Weston died a few years afterward but many would argue he effectively died the first time he appeared on this show When I saw it for the first time that cold Saturday morning and fell despondent back into my bed part of me died too
Wow I can t believe people consider this a good movie Now I have seen much worse but there are much more romantic funny comedies with John Cusack br br This is a mediocre film at best While the acting wasn t terrible but not great for a romantic comedy there was little passion little romance There were many loose ends that don t show up or are not addressed Unfortunately the main characters do come off as complete cowards They don t know themselves well enough to realize that they don t love the people they are engaged to How do we know they aren t in love By the utter lack of remorse both characters have for leaving their finances I can think of few things more romantic than the continual escape from commitment that these two show br br The movie doesn t even end with a wedding scene more than likely both will get cold feet and drop each other like hot potatoes once a commitment is nearing This movie is really about two people who can t commit to anything unlike Cusack s previous characters who were more than willing to make a deep commitment Loyd in Say Anything Martin in Grosse Pointe Blank etc br br The greatest failure of this movie was the complete lack of any twists turns or anything of interest When the movie ended I felt like they had failed to include a climax to the story which basically fits the whole movie boring No suspense about whether the two will end up together no joy when they do no consequences to their actions br br It is sad that people are so blind to the shoddiness of this movie that they simply rebuke any criticism with Everyone is too Cynical Criticism of this movie is not cynicism simply unbiased examination There are many other better romantic comedies even ones with Grace Kelly or Eva Marie Saint br br If you think this movie is great try these movies you hearts will explode The Princess Bride Say Anything Grosse Pointe Blank High Fidelity Keeping the Faith Charade Rear Window North by Northwest or There s Something About Mary which is a good examination of idealized romance vs today s society
Oh for crying out loud this has got to be the LAMEST movie I ve seen all year and I m sorry the normally awesome John Cusack was even involved in this brainless twitty piece of Stupidity Where Sleepless in Seattle delivered what amounts to be the same message albeit on a more subtle somewhat more mature level Serendipity delivers it with a sledgehammer and then proceeds to pound it into your psyche for the next tedious hour and a half or so and that s an hour and a half of my life I ll never get back again thank you very much It s bad enough the main characters of this movie have the emotional maturity level of fourteen year olds actually I ve known better fourteen year olds except maybe for Jeremy Piven who was enjoyable enough Just the first 15 minutes or so of the movie where Kate Beckinsale s character plays that annoying silliness of a game about throwing all sensibility to the wind literally had my best friend and I irritated beyond belief I told my husband Rockstar had more intelligence and at least the characters in Rockstar weren t half as dysfunctional as the idiots were in this Serendipitous mess It s annoying to watch protagonists who seem to have no clue about choice in their lives and feel they re nothing more than puppets to destiny and the whims of fate How utterly tiresome I m sure this movie will be more likely enjoyed by those who d rather not engage in the chaotic messiness of making more complex life choices and then responsibly living with the consequences After all here s a movie where our hero and heroine live happily ever after only after wreaking havoc and misery on two other people s lives namely their respective fiancées not to mention other relatives and friends just to get there br br
Not exactly a new story line but this romantic comedy makes the concept work A young man John Cusack and a drop dead gorgeous woman Kate Beckinsale keep meeting by chance and wonder if they are meant for each other Although both are promised to others oddly enough they still feel that their soul mate is out there somewhere A little sappy in some places but viva la love Being a romantic I am almost obligated to be riveted My favorite scene is where Cusack is on the ground and snow starts falling The finale is almost too sweet but most deserving This is not one of Cusack s deeper roles but who in the hell could not be smitten by Beckinsale Notable support is provided by Jeremy Piven and Molly Shannon John Corbett plays the worst role I ve ever seen him in On the other hand Eugene Levy is quirky and funny Watch this with your soul mate
The master of cheap erotic horror Rolfe Kanefsky finally makes a movie that doesn t go straight to the Playboy Channel The Hazing borrows heavily from everything that came before it from Nightmare on Elm Street to Evil Dead but still manages to do it with enough humor to make it watchable just barely The characters are cardboard the dialogue is wooden the story is paper thin and the actors couldn t act their way out of a grocery bag Put that all together and you have a pulpy ball of mulch for a movie Sometimes when I m bored I like to eat paper Watching this movie is a lot like that Chew on it for 90 minutes and you re left with a weird taste in your mouth and no nutritional value
This was truly dreadful It had a terrible storyline was poorly acted and was like an amateur remake of evil dead but not nearly as good br br It took all my tenacity to make it through this one it s a good job I didn t have to visit the toilet else I doubt I would have come back This one makes Hammer House of Horror look like a big screen Hollywood epic br br The only value to this movie was the never ending supply of beautiful women Not a bad one among them br br If you want to letch with your friends after a night on the beer then this one s for you else avoid it like the plague
I saw this movie primarily to see Brooke Burke as Jill who I had meet briefly in LA at a modeling trade show in her first feature film I was hoping to see more of her but thought she did very well acting her role Since she is such a beautiful and poised TV host and model it was not surprising I was left wondering why she was killed and what happened as a result Maybe I just missed it br br I wasn t really sure about the genre of this movie and although I liked the actors I felt like it was for a college audience I tried to keep an open mind considering horror wasn t my favorite genre but felt like I had outgrown the gags It seemed to drag out in some places leave you guessing in some places about what powers the evil professor had and like a lot of other films had an unsatisfying ending br br Having written a couple of scripts I know a lot of this is difficult and may come down to personal opinions how many movies you have seen studied and those you relate with at a point in time br br In a nutshell I found it interesting but not a satisfying plot and ending for me If Jill Brooke Burke would have returned through the portal in the end and kicked everyone s ass that would be a satisfying ending and would earn a higher rating
i cannot believe i wasted 80 minutes of my life watching this terrible film i kept hoping it was going to get better by the end but boy was I wrong The plot was abysmal the acting was extremely poor and the special effects were awful Not even the 2 beautiful girls could revive my interest in this boring and bloody mess However i cannot lie some of the lines in this film were quite memorable such as when the Asian boy says i lost my virginity to the babysitter so f stereotypes br br please do not waste your time with this crash unless u are prepared or want to have a good laugh maybe that way u can watch it to rip this movie with some mates
The Hazing is confused mumbo jumbo that wants so hard to be The Evil Dead that it even references Bruce Campbell several times The problem is it is simply not in the same league as that terrific movie This movie is nowhere near as original The plot has been used before by Kevin Tenney in Night of the Demons and that was a lot more fun This flick wastes too much time with complicated exposition before getting the kids into the spooky mansion and starting the demonic happenings br br Brad Dourif is as usual not given much to do here but when he is on screen he puts in another over the top performance that would make Christopher Walken jealous As for the acting of the kids it s passable but by no means good The shaky camera work is more annoying than clever or atmospheric There are a few good moments when the first guy gets possessed and throws around some deadly one liners while dispatching his victims but it was never scary for a second The gore level is mid range to low but the director tries to make up for it by showing the actresses topless a few times All in all just okay if you have 87 minutes to waste
The script was VERY weak w o enough character arcs to make you care one bit about the characters or what happens to them The script is way too talky and not enough gore or action to even call it slow paced The story gets to the point that you just want everyone to shut up and die as quickly as possible so you don t have to listen to them talk this very muted stiff dialogue On a technical note the music mix is way to high and makes it hard to understand what is being said most times Then again this could be called a blessing Overall this same story could have better been told in a short film w a running time under 30 minutes The obvious in your face homages to Sam Raimi and Evil Dead would have been good had they been more subtle but here they seem more like a bald faced rip off C mon this kind of 35mm budget and THIS is the best that could be done Still the cinematography lighting design and shots were very well done indeed
Exactly what you would expect from a B Movie Deritive gratuitous nudity boring in parts ridiculous gore and cheesy special effects Of course it could have been better better acted defintly better written directed etc But then I guess it wouldn t have been a B movie The actors pretty much sucked in fact this pretty much seemed like an episode of buffy the vampire slayer or something except with a lot of blood profanity and nudity br br Tiffany Shepis must be singled out She absolutely is the scream queen of the new millennium Not that acting really matters in these movies but she was better than any of the other actors She s also smokin hot in that plastic jump suit thing she wore for the whole movie wow Her posterior is absolutely stunning in that outfit I mean it every single time she turns around you can help but check her out And near then end of the film the viewer is rewarded with seeing her completely nekked br br So if your a looser b movie horror buff like myself check this out If not you should probably avoid at all costs
i love horror films low budget 50 s 60 s 70 s 80 s but how can anyone think this is a very good horror film let s compare it to titles in a similar vein haunted house films the haunting the changeling the shining or for a similar technology based horror film that was FAAAR better though still FAR from great Demon Seed OK i ll be fair let s compare it to made for TV horror films don t go to sleep waaay creepier and better done salem s lot the night stalker night gallery even don t go in the basement or crowhaven farm were far better SPOILERS first of all for as good a scene as the bloody shower scene was you have a scene like the opening scene oh boy the garden hose comes alive to hose down some frisky teenagers TERRIBLE also just what we understand about the house it apparently needs to use its video cameras to see what is going on and it s a very emotional house not a spirit or demon or entity it s a house thats possessed but by what we are led to believe an inanimate object learned to love suzie margaret our protagonist now that I m on the topic of suzie another scene that totally bothered me this poor old crazy lady comes tells you she was your nurse pours her heart out falls in the boiling pool struggling in agony for 45 seconds and what does margaret do does she risk her hands being burnt to save this poor elderly woman that came there to warn her s life no she stands there and watches the acting for the most part was better than average for a horror film but that s where the positives end for at least a more interesting and fun horror film about an inanimate object that kills people watch death bed the bed that eats i have a feeling the people who rated this so highly either haven t watched it since it originally aired or remembered it scaring them as children this film was pretty much merit less
It s kind of fascinating to me that so many reviewers consider this a masterpiece I am not a dullard as far as quality films go and I will agree that from a technical filming standpoint as well as for several of the characters portrayed the film is in an award worthy class But there is no sense for me of this film actually going anywhere I mean taking the viewer anywhere It is a series of mood scenes perhaps remarkable as such but I want more from a film I look for story and movement and a fulfillment of arrival none of which did I find in this film Yes it might be considered poetry on film but there is much poetry that I cannot live with for the same reason that it paints pictures without going anywhere br br One thing further to be said is that it documents a mid century English childhood which is necessarily limited in its universality I was personally appalled at what a young British boy had to live through in that time and place Having grown up in America just a decade earlier I can authoritatively say that the contrast is immense I cannot help wondering if this contrast has had some effect on those reviewing the film so favorably In other words could there be a tendency to judge the film entirely on its filmic magic which I acknowledge is there and completely ignore its lack of relevance to the nature of one s actual recalled experience
I had to watch this in school And to sum it up br br Talentless actors talentless script and a talentless director br br This movie is such a waste of your time Don t even watch the movie Don t bother You will be so disappointed My teacher said it was supposed to be good How wrong she was She even slept through it a little The movie s actors were just bad The best actor in there was the old man and that s not saying much It s has horrible plot with awful characters So unrealistic and I can honestly said it had no point The script was unemotional and confusing There was points in the movie when I furrowed my brows and said What Also there were just too many loose ties and plot holes It was just absolutely horrendous
But I got over it To me it seemed that even the Author of the book favored Caroline I felt so sorry for the character Louise and she was constantly compared with Esau who was evil I just felt the comparison was a bit harsh and un realistic Really though the movie was bad I wouldn t really see it unless you re ready for a big let down
This movie is a perfect example of an excellent book getting ruined by a movie Jacob Have I Loved is quite possibly the worst film that I have ever seen There is no storyline plots disappear and the editing is awful To top it all off the music is straight from a synthesizer and sounds unbelievably terrible Bridget Fonda s acting is decent but everyone else s acting is totally amateur I would suggest this movie to someone who is studying to be a producer as a study on how not to produce a movie as it is chock full of bad cut scenes bad transitions and acting that should have been re shot Read the book and don t waste your time with this film
This was just plain terrible I read this book for school i made As on all of the tests and to see it like this My teacher forced me and 20 other people to watch it and it was worse than Leonard Part 6 Plan 9 from Outer Space and Hudson Hawk put together The thing that made this film so terrible was enough reasons to want to kill yourself over First of all it was made on Hallmark Second the acting was terrible Third it was like completely different from the book Literally it was so bad I asked myself to be excused Basically I would rather watch Basic Instinct 2 than watch this Take my advice don t watch this film No one would want to watch this It was horrible HORRIBLE
Really started the 80s trend of disgusting violence masquerading as a horror film I was the target audience for this repellent piece of trash and I was disgusted then as now br br Oh where do we start Let s see the setup You can bring people back to live IF they died a violent death So that laughably weak premise is the excuse to butcher people in horrible ways because well that s needed to bring them back to life This might have worked if played over the top for black laughs a la Re Animator or something But no it s played straight There is a whole terrified family in a wagon that gets hunted down one of the few scenes at least where their demise is off screen However just about everything else is on screen There is actually a scene where a young girl walking along is beaten and killed by zombie townspeople who are all filming it and grinning with several cameras Then there is a closeup of her face as the filmmakers lovingly and time consumingly reveal in time lapse photography her beaten face being carved down to a skull and rebuilt to look normal again This done of course by a slumming Jack Albertson as the mortician behind it all He likes to drive around in a ambulance hearse playing old Tommy Dorcey tunes I guess that is supposed to be cute br br In the end of course even the Sheriff is undead and the doctor offers kindly to fix his rotting hands Not clear why the Sheriff is not out with the other townspeople killing children with glee and slicing their faces off sticking needles in burn victims eyes etc br br I wonder really wonder what people see in a geek show like this to give it any kind of rating at all It s not scary the twists are laughable and overall it s kind of sick It s not even well enough done to see it on a dare or enjoy on a level you might watch a bad HG Lewis film It s just God awful trash made for people who get off on this type of pointless gore and made by people slumming for a paycheck br br Sad that Albertson was even involved
Christopher Lambert is annoying and disappointing in his portrayal as GIDEON This movie could have been a classic had Lambert performed as well as Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump or Dustin Hoffman as Raymond Babbitt in RAIN MAN or Sean Penn as Sam Dawson in I AM SAM br br Too bad because the story line is meaningful to us in life the supporting performances by Charlton Heston Carroll O Connor Shirley Jones Mike Connors and Shelley Winters were excelent 3 of 10
The story line has been rehashed a number of times a breath of life in the retirement home Several plays movies novels short stories poems and news articles have beat the subject to no end but it s still an excellent platform for character studies br br If Gideon was crafted more enthusiastically it could be brilliant but the dialogue is painfully boring and the story is absolutely flooded with cliches even the subtitle and summary of Gideon s simple wisdom almost made me laugh in its ineffectiveness Mostly indifferent acting is the final straw for this weak film but the rest of it is bland enough to make the actors lack of focus almost irrelevant
This film is so bad you can t imagine The acting is terrible even worse than in third class soap operas An it is a shame that this movie was the most successful in the past 20 years in Switzerland The interactions between the soldiers didn t make any sense at all The story could have been taken out from a bravo photo story the dialogues were as wooden as Treebeard and the plot holes were bigger than the black hole in the middle of our galaxy But nowadays it doesn t need much to satisfy the audience The actors were handsome for example the former Miss Switzerland and the main character was even hung woah and there certainly was much abuse of drugs That s real cool man Particularly for 12 and 13 year old teens But the media created an atmosphere in witch you was not allowed to reject the film because they manipulated the peer group dynamics by telling implicitly that you are a nerd if you don t go along with the other sheep and say yes that is exactly what it was like when I was in the army that s exactly what I m going to do when I must go to the army to every cheesy action that had to do with drugs and coolness And don t think I like the army I was there and I hated it but this film is worse than cleaning up the sticky toilet with a teeth brush which I was forced to do because I offended an lieutenant It is not necessary for every film to be sophisticated Sometimes you only want to be entertained for a few hours and forget about problems and I think its not a bad thing But this kind of films influence teenagers to much by showing them a cool lifestyle which in fact is only stupid and turns them into brainless ignorant and egocentric idiots But since I now that my opinion isn t very popular I will be quiet now and recommend you to avoid this terrible flick at any costs and for that to save your wits br br 2 10 br br sorry for my bad English
Seriously avoid this movie at any cost I just saw it in my first sneak preview ever and although I paid non refundable money for it I walked out of the cinema after a mere 15 minutes Which already includes 2 minutes of discussion among my friends whether or not to leave First time EVER I walked out of a movie And I lived through some pretty bad ones br br It s one of those films that is dubbed and badly so even though it is shown in its original language It relies on the oldest simplest and cheapest jokes in the book On the military What do we do once we reach the fighting zone You get out of the car and die actually it s much funnier to read here that the way it was delivered in the film on drugs a guy eats some space cookies behaves really silly and misses his wedding or has to live through it while high all badly written and acted on women in the army Why do we only get trumpets We were promised guns That s the way it is that s the way it ll stay Argh Okay you might actually find these genuinely funny but in that case you seriously scare me br br Additionally I have seen better acting in the kind of soft porn films you get on European late night TV So it had lame jokes delivered badly beyond lower average acting lacked pace was badly dubbed and edited It just didn t work At least not on any level used as a measure for films br br I would even be so bold as to say that this flick proves that there are people who can be a lot less funny zan zee Germans And that s saying something if you like stereotypes Which I don t it s nice to play with them though Just in case somebody thinks I m not being PC enough br br Instead of going to see this film do something useful Try to teach crocheting to prawns paint your toenails in a really irritating colour disassemble your bicycle change some light bulbs try to understand Einstein s theories convert to a different religion and back in fact go and listen to Last Christmas by Wham on endless repeat Anything but don t watch this awful flick
This film makes American Pie a sophisticated movie No further comment needed Humor is cheap dialogues are stupid and the cast is awkward Every cliché is used several times without any original twist And far the worst the movie turns out to be more catholic than the Pope It s so sad
Well AWFUL is just the first name This movie is a cliché ridden piece of junk A high school comedy setup in a military training camp I m sorry I had to give this 1 star which it did not deserve br br THIS MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS br br Just about everything is totally forced unconvincing and unrealistic The HEPO military police will not come to get you if you don t make your appearance especially not on your wedding day The actors were pretty embarrassed during this scene because the scene didn t work as it was so highly unlikely You can sense it in their voices Even if they were not such bad actors they wouldn t have been able to save the scene br br Next the guy has to exercise in his wedding suit No there was no time to get him an uniform first Man this is great cinematography I will remember this scene for the rest of my life br br There are also GIRLS in the camp exciting one of em even a model though not looking that great and the baddest actress I ve ever seen I doubt in Hollywood they would let her say a single line in a B movie br br Okay girls in the military Now this is getting fun The girls are even placed on the same floor so we can sneak to their room at night In reality they would be placed in a different building a quarter mile away separated by two fences with barbed wire br br There are tanks available we can use for a fun ride in our spare time of which we have plenty No the tanks are not locked and the ignition keys are inserted No one will notice the engine sounds especially not at night br br There is a bunch of sex scenes and references and all are below the waste line We need those so the sexually obsessed Germans will like the movie as well Switzerland is too small a market for any feature film Well done br br One sex scene takes place in the kitchen Surely none of those facilities are ever locked The military routines are as sloppy as they can get br br In the end of the brainless flick the mafia hit men are about the take revenge on the poor guy trying to shoot him Because he deserted his fiancée Sure I buy that the Italians are that way a jealous bunch not br br The bad guys attempt to do this in open daylight with two dozen eyewitnesses Not at night in a dark alley Again military training grounds where there is shooting with live ammo are open to the public anyone can freely drive or walk in there There are no such things as guards or fences br br The deed however is prevented by the good captain timely launching a rocket into the Italians car The explosion knocks the hit men and the enraged fiancée off their feet No one in 40 feet distance is hurt when the car is blown to smithereens It s a COMEDY remember br br Okay It s a comedy I got that and I can live with that No realism needed Filmmakers can easily get way with this if it is hilariously side splitting funny or entertaining interesting challenging Unfortunately it is none of those It s just embarrassing A rip off from brainless American comedies The latter are at least done professionally with no amateur actors br br It is pretty boring and predictable a waste of time and energy especially to those sitting through the entire movie as I unfortunately did Yawn
The fact that this movie has been entitled to the most successful movie in Switzerland s film history makes me shake my head It s true but pitiful at the same time A flick about the Swiss army could be a good deal better br br The story sounds interesting at the beginning Antonio Carrera Michael Koch gets forced to absolve his military training by the army while he is in the church wedding his love Laura Moretti Mia Aegerter br br The Acting in some way doesn t really differ from just a few recruits getting drunk and stoned in the reality Melanie Winiger plays her role as the strong Michelle Bluntschi mediocre personally i found her rather annoying br br The storyline contains a comedy combined with a romance which does not work as expected The romance part is too trashy and the comedy part is not funny at all it s just a cheap try and does not change throughout the whole movie whatsoever It s funny for preadolescent 12 13 year olds but not for such as those who search an entertaining comedy The humor is weak except for some shots br br Dope Cool Stealing Cool If you want a proper comedy about the Swiss RS make sure you did not absolve your military training yet and even then don t expect too much br br I ll give it 4 out of 10 stars because Marco Rima is quite funny during his screen time Not a hell of a lot screen time though
The youthful group in St Elmo s Fire who just graduated from college barely seem able to make it through high school much less four years at any prominent university For the most part these kids are irresponsible selfish greedy and stupid yet co writer and director Joel Schumacher appears to hold them up as touchstones for a generation With a now outdated cast of up and comers a background score that sounds awfully similar to that of Terms Of Endearment and writing which lords the smugness of this circle over us Fire is a paltry blaze one that gets even more embarrassing as the years pass on 1 2 from
Joel Schumaker directs the script he co wrote and has a group of Georgetown grads confronted with adult life situations The story line is a scrambled mess but some scenes are actually good There is a lot of wasted talent and time here The cast is more impressive than the movie Featured are Demi Moore Rob Lowe Judd Nelson Andrew McCarthy Emilio Estevez Ally Sheedy and Mare Winningham The most notable being McCarthy and Moore Lowe is quite obnoxious Coming of age is not so damn easy
I think I ve seen this sort of thing before college graduates not realizing they have it pretty damn good all the while complaining that their lives suck br br This movie is highly derivative of The Big Chill and Reality Bites from what I can make of it they practically have the same plot br br If anything good came out of this snore fest it was the music That was it br br As far as I m concerned I m not impressed but then again I never expected anything less This movie was directed by the same person that directed Batman and Robin another movie that should only be viewed with a blindfold in tow br br Now for the verdict it s a 1 out of 10
St Elmo s Fire has no bearing on life after university at all for the majority of us common folk anyway Why was this garbage even made Who can really relate to this Who lives like these characters I truly feel sorry for the actors having to deal with such a terrible script There are some talented young actors in this film that have done a good job elsewhere It must have just been one whole joke to them on set br br I actually found this film insulting to my intelligence The only joy I got from this is hoping that Sir John Hughes had a good ol laugh when he saw a screening of this the same year his masterpiece of The Breakfast Club was released br br Don t make the same mistake I did of watching this because you enjoy 80 s films It really is that offensive to the genre
I ll probably get a lot of flack for hating this movie guess I didn t approach it with the proper dewy eyed nostalgia of the generation before me But suffice it to say St Elmo s Fire was pretty crap freaking tastic even as far as Brat Pack films go br br Here is yet another lovely example of the smug self indulgent neurosis that is everything 80s RENT anyone The plot is virtually non existent and the philosophies are kitchy at best poorly delivered the rest of the time The complete lack of anything resembling sympathetic characters doesn t help the situation There really was no growth no forward movement at all Even the climactic suicide scene was effectually neutered by once again refusing to let death or anything resembling reality or adult life enter in br br Each cookie cutter figure simply goes about making you hate them in the blandest most predictable way possible The Stalker is a creep for no discernible reason other than he is a Stalker and Andie MacDowell is gorgeous The Jackass does everything in his power to constantly remind you he is well a jackass The Gorgeous Slut hides really soulful deep pain with a wild lifestyle The Poet moods and mopes around for a full 3 4 of the film until he can reveal he actually is full of teddy bears and sunshine and rainbows The Virgin finally becomes a whole happy human being after getting every Virgin s desire of one hot roll in the sack with a Jackass before he ditches her to really change for real this time The Cheating Bastard cheats until it is time for him to get caught And finally The Feminist go around dousing holy water on any soul that utters commitment br br Which brings me to my final beef what bond of super cement was holding these people together as friends I can t imagine being with just one of them Now think of the vortex created by all that narcissism centered in one bar And they were all so terrible to each other heads in toilets near rape and sleeping around with everrrryone The cherry was after two BFFs act like total baboons after screwing the Feminist she s like umm actually I don t want to be with either of you anymore Let s be friends And we can hang out in a totally unawkward way every day knowing that I may hook up with one or the other at any given point but neither of you are satisfying enough for commitment NOT THAT WORD And they all smile as if to say Golly gee I never thought of that What a great idea br br Only it s not Kinda in the way that watching this movie is not
I saw this in the theater when it came out and just yesterday I saw it again on cable This I was able to reacquainted myself with the feeling of just how revolting this film is The whole bunch of characters are self absorbed narcisstic preeners Worst of all it reinforces every negative stereotype about 20 something dating even as it purports to celebrate people finding themselves The nice guys finish last the jerky guys make out great the jerkiest guys do best The girls are all boy toy pushovers Only one character Wendy is seen doing anything remotely useful to society and she dispenses with her long saved virginity in a throwaway one night stand with a scumbag in a lushly filmed scene that we re supposed to think is romantic What this really is is Hollywood s concept of young America permissive detached promiscuous conceited
What happened in the making of this movie so that it ended up as the total mess it is Just one year after The Breakfast Club a brilliant movie with many of the same actors as in St Elmo s Fire who by the way looked and acted in the latter more like they were still the high school misfits from the former but without the grip or discipline in portraying their roles br br Was it the directing or the writing Since it was the same person Joel Schumacher it must be both But then Schumacher has since given us The Phantom of the Opera Phone Booth A Time to Kill and two Batman movies Batman and Robin and Batman Forever which range from good to great directing Something went wrong on StEF because it has no genius whatsoever no comedy worth anything and is very far off the mark on what is truly valuable in life br br Example The character Wendy a rich little girl with a heart to do good and help the less fortunate played by Mare Winningham reveals to Billy an unruly slob who cheats on his wife and on his girlfriends drinks far too much and has no sense of order in his life appropriately played by Rob Lowe that she is still a virgin Billy truly see a challenge and possible conquest but Wendy is not ready Wendy in fact is so not ready it is hard to believe she is in this clique of friends Later in the story when Billy whose wife has left him taken his child and married another has somehow drawn some of the strings of his life together Billy is leaving for New York deserting and abandoning all parental responsibility for his baby daughter he convinces Wendy that her virginity would be the perfect going away gift from her to him And Wendy who works as a social worker helping broken families seems not to be phased at all by this despot Give me a break The one thing she can only give once she gives to a loser who is leaving his family and friends Schumacher frames this scene as a wonderful and touching moment br br Many more example exist where there is a complete disconnect between what is real and of value being tossed overboard and the acts are made to look like virtue br br I suppose some may say that that was the 80 s but I remember it was in the 80 s that men began to be held responsible for the children they fathered whether in a marriage or out br br I think this movie is so bad because it is so out of sync with what it really valuable and right br br As for the technique not the story it was terrible as well It is disjointed and feels like a 3 hour movie that has been edited to 1 hour and 40 minutes Transitions and jumps in time simply do not make sense Pick up what is on the editing room floor put it back in and the movie would probably flow much better but it still is a horrible movie br br Maybe Schumacher has become a better and stronger director since 1986 he must have or maybe he was over his head when it came to writing the screenplay for St Elmo s Fire or maybe this group of actors took over the set and went their own way that is what I really think happened
I noticed Fire was on cable the other night and I began watching it because I couldn t recall anything specific about it other than I remember it being a horrible film when I saw it back in 85 Twenty years later the film is still awful Besides the synthesizer the saxophone was the most abused instrument in pop music during the 1980s as is evident in the title song Hearing that song again made me want to jab a screwdriver in my ears to end the sonic misery inflicted upon them And to compound this musical assault Rob Lowe s character played saxophone and there was one scene where he played a solo that went on and on like he was Charlie Parker only his shrill tone and playing were more reminiscent of a monkey playing a kazoo All the characters were intensely unappealing although I must say they did a great job of casting equally unappealing actors to portray them Actually I thought Mare Winningham was appealing and I initially felt sorry for her character because she wore funny underwear but then near the end of the movie she decides to have sex with Rob Lowe s character who would probably be voted most likely to transfer a variety of sexual diseases if such thing were voted upon
I don t know what it was about this film that made me react so viscerally against it Perhaps it was the characters who so unlikable and were not compelling enough to care about Perhaps it was the disorganized storyline Perhaps it was the fact that Rob Lowe wore a long dangly earring and eyeliner Perhaps it was because at some point in the movie they all break out in song Perhaps it was because the 1980s were never that 80s Perhaps it was because everything was a garish hyperbole Perhaps it was because a character pumps his fist while driving away from the camera during a fade out I don t know what it was that made me hate it so but if it means trying to watch it again I m not willing to find out
Heather Graham couldn t play a convincing lesbian if her life depended on it Who do the producers of the movie think they are the ABSOLUTE WORST most UNREALISTIC movie i ve seen in as long as i can remember This movie is so bad that i felt compelled to sign up on IMDb and make sure the rating of this film drops br br omg i m Heather Graham i just kissed a drunk chick so while she s passed out i m REALLY going to pace around my room for HOURS asking myself frantically WHAT HAVE I DONE Jesus heather get over it and grow up and i d like to forward that same sentiment to the idiot producers and while i m at it instead of this movie being all about an pathetic excuse for a coming out story perhaps it would have been more suitable to focus the plot onto a character who s mentally unstable like your so called lesbian character after all i know the first time i had gay sex when i left the next morning i jumped to the sky in excitement in the middle of the street honestly b tch get a grip br br WHAT A JOKE and please note there are many many many more flaws and appallingly stupid aspects to this lame flick but i m so sick of even thinking about it anymore bottom line if you re a smart person you ll hate this movie and if you re not a smart person then you ll love it it s as simple as that
I don t know who Sue Kramer the director of this film is but I have a strong suspicion that A she is a lesbian and B she somehow shamed everyone involved in this project to participate to prove they are not homophobic br br I can imagine everyone thinking My God this is horrible Not funny Pedestrian Totally lame But keeping their mouths shut for fear they will be labeled anti gay or they don t get the gay lifestyle This is probably why Kramer did NOT cast gay people to play gay people too Anyway it s not even worth reviewing The actors are all directed to play every scene completely over the top so there is no sincerity or believability in anything they do It s full of clichés and there is nothing about this movie that is the least bit amusing much less funny br br I hated it and I m not afraid to say so Too bad the gutless people who gave Kramer the money to make this bomb weren t as unbiased in their judgment
OH MY GOD THE WORST SH T I VE EVER SEEN this is the main thought which came into my mind right after watching the movie And I really do not understand anybody with opposite myth Though maybe the idea was good but the effect miserable I especially mean the role of H Graham What was that In my opinion it has destroyed all positive intentions of producers The character was played in affected and annoying way Every time she appears it reminds that you re watching a movie and is destroying a spirit of the moment then whole movie because the most time what you can see there are her stupid faces with more stupid attempts to create the emotion TERRIBLE don t waste your time
Wow probable the worst movie i have ever seen This person should never make another movie I cant believe anyone would have produce this in good conscience YOu have have wasted every cent No concept of real life I have wasted 2 hours of my life i will never get back EVER Everyone who worked on this show should be embarrassed I m embarrassed for them All of you should be ashamed If i was gay i would want to tell the director that they have personally set back gay rights progress by 5 years Please never watch this movie I have never written a blogg about a film before but The distaste for this film has compelled me to do so
Okay let me coin a new word here polyphobia The fear of polyamorous relationships This is yet another in a long line of movies which start out by titillating audiences about some kind of threesome only to turn on a dime and go all preachy about how it is oh so necessary and the only moral thing to find a monogamistic solution Only one person in a thousand understands the delight of being able to love more than one person and this director is not one of them Bleh br br Mark my words a few decades from now polyphobia is going to be just as big a faux pas as homophobia but guess who was too close minded to realize this Right the first time the producers of this movie And so many like it Why even make a ridiculously conservative and old fashioned type of movie like this Priding itself on being limitlessly open minded about gayness it completely overlooks the fact that we live in an age where monogamy is turning into sequential monogamy which in turn in turning into swinging and polyamory Open your eyes people please br br This is a disappointing run of the mill chick flick But damn I gotta say Heather Graham is the cutest thing alive br br 3 out of 10
It is important not to be insulted by lack of logic or common sense and those who have any gray matters will agree that this movie just doesn t work br br The problems lay in the direction cast selections and lack of depth in the character building The word comedy was very hard thing to say when i expect to laugh when these words are used Let s look at the problems in direction script br br Brother and sister both in their mid 30 s seem to be well adjusted They meet a complete stranger at a park and Heather Graham character walks up to her and asks the most intimate questions that even half sane person would be running the other way or at least scream for a police officer He then awkwardly walks over and makes some stupid statements and she falls for him Then after ONE date were they all go out together he falls in love with her and decides to get married in Vegas in a week s time Hello does anyone feel stupid yet He goes out with thousands of women and he meets this one person who says about 10 words that WE see on the screen and he wants to marry her Not only was there no chemistry it just doesn t make sense Sure it s a romantic comedy and I want to believe it could but the direction made it completely flat br br Now Heather falls head over heels with her too and when Heather Graham and Bridget Moynahan very shallow character kiss or more to the point it was sloppiest kiss ever that chemistry MIGHT be there I found it unromantic and unfunny and while many say Heather cannot act i think the reality is Heather was clearly the wrong person for this role br br This was Sue Kramer debut as a director and to me it was just too much for her to chew It would take a lot of craft to make this movie work and IMHO it could be done with better writers and casting and direction
I watched this movie yesterday and was highly disappointed br br Heather Graham and Tom Cavanaugh basically had to carry this awkwardly unbelievable script for five hours or however long it actually was From the beginning every single element of this movie is unbelievable This movie made me chuckle several times but they were mainly out of shock that the director writer actually expected us to believe the many messy scattered elements that attempted to piece this movie together br br The movie s focus is Gray Graham and her issues with intimacy Things get interesting when she realizes that she and her brother have unexpectedly WAY too much in common br br Interesting intriguing However instead of unraveling this story into something believable and palatable the director keeps taking Gray into these ludicrous twists that never actually make any sense at all Being an LGBT individual this movie seemed to echo what all heterosexuals think we go through in the coming out process I ll be insulted if the writer s queer Had it not been for the cute chemistry between Cavanaugh and Graham which by the way was understandably forced I would give it a negative 3 stars
The first half of this movie is a pure delight Novel Funny Wonderful performances A close knit brother and sister living in Manhattan fall for the same woman Adult Bright Witty What more could you ask As a romantic comedy this starts refreshing It heads into unexplored territory And then it falls apart br br It goes from being a universal adult comedy to a coming of age coming out of the closet story that has been done many times before What a disappointment As a people film it begins with such promise Why does it need to turn into such a pedestrian I am who I am film The freeze frame ending shot of Heather Graham s jumping in the air to celebrate her happiness at finding herself underlines the banality of the last part of the film br br It could have been different It could have been magical It ended up being the same old same old
This is one of the worst movies I have seen this year You should not see this movie but if you insist on wasting your time you should stop here there are SPOILERS Gray Matters centers on Gray and Sam Baldwin Heather Graham and Tom Cavanagh Only Gray and Sam are Brother and Sister living together in everyone else s eyes as man and wife No sex but just about everything else Early on the movie starts with its theme the most absurd thing at the most absurd moment with you guessed it the most absurd reactions Gray and Sam decided to check out the dog park with a borrowed pooch Rather then push her brother to get the skinny on first woman they see for him she does it and gets to the nitty gritty questions too When she signals her brother to come over they start a 3 way date Charlie Bridget Moynahan is the girl of THEIR dreams like all the right things etc Sam final hits Gray over the head and the couple finishes the date with a marriage proposal That Charlie accepts In one week Charlie Gray and Sam are to be in Vegas In the next week Charlie and Gray are off shopping for wedding gowns apparently Charlie has an off the rack figure Gray is slurping an iced latte when Charlie suggests Gray tries on some gowns as well and picks out a 10 000 frock for her While Charlie is zipping her in this down payment on a house gown Gray continues to slurp on the latte I swear it was like a feed bag What should happen but woops latte all over the gown It is never explained how they got out of Bloomingdale s bridal salon with out a 10 000 mocha colored gown Back to reality Caesar s palace Las Vegas They have the high roller room Sam is a resident surgeon and Charlie is an intern zoologist were do they get all this money Gray kicks Sam out to the single room down the hall so she and Charlie can have a bachelorette drink a thon were you guessed it they kiss Gray remembers everything Charlie remembers nada They make it to wedding chapel and right when the Reverend gets to his line If there is anybody is here who has any objection whatsoever to the union of these two lovebirds Gray gets the hiccups Gray excuses herself for some reason the Reverend must repeat his last line and right on queue again hiccups Gray gets back to NY and starts dating any man she meets literally And of course one is you guessed it again Gay The other is a jerk and the third is a taxi cab driver Alan Cummings named Gordy He is smittened with Gray but the feelings are not returned They become great friends This is good because when she comes clean with Sam about the kiss He blows up and kicks her out of their apartment When Sam comes to his senses he goes to her office Gray works at an ad agency This office is smack in the middle of the twilight zone It has cameras and microphones in all the conference rooms that broadcast to all computer monitors at the agency Sam gets Gray in one of the conference rooms for a not so private conversation and ends up outing her to the entire office This is where I doubt that there was a gay man or lesbian on the crew Gordy comes to her rescue and convinces her to go to a lesbian bar Sorry no men says the bouncer So Gray and Gordy return with Gordy in drag Bad drag He was in a sleeveless black satin like blouse a string of pearls and a grandma s church hat No lesbian would ever confuse this man in a dress as a drag queen much less a woman The bar was also the straight man s fantasy of what a lesbian bar is full of Victoria s Secret models Everything turns out peachy she goes home with her firm s client Gray happens to be on the woman s account and finally does more then kiss For some reason no one tells Charlie anything and she is oblivious through the whole movie of this kiss with Gray but that is for the sequel
I wish I d known more about this movie when I rented it I d put it in my queue on the basis of Heather Graham and her strong cred as an actress IMHO While parts of the movie were charming much of the movie felt contrived undeveloped or otherwise just boring or predictable Not to mention the ICK factor of so many people thinking the sibs were a couple I don t care how big a part of the story line that is it still felt a bit um gross And Charlie for a zoologist she certainly doesn t seem to be very attuned to signals from other Homo sapiens What was it about her besides her hotness and some common interests that made Gray fall for her The story could have been so much more interesting with a little more depth High points Molly Shannon although I do agree with the reviewer who found her annoying on occasion the cabbie in drag and the dance sequences if Sam Gray were such great dancers I wish we d seen more of that as the bits we were shown were indeed better than most of the rest of the movie Could have been better
I had to walk out on this film fifteen minutes from the end having passed through the cringe stage and into pure boredom What really horrifies me I mean truly disturbs me is that there are people referring to this aimless drivel as delightful or a must see I would feel deep pity for those so afflicted were it not for the distinct impression that most of the positive comments about this shallow and humourless travesty were written by industry plants br br The truth is this is a lame film that does nothing to entertain nor enlighten It is decidedly unfunny poorly scripted and has all the pace and energy of cold canned rice pudding To be kind to Ms Kramer the best one can say is it was a missed opportunity for having read the synopsis before I watched it I had expected something more challenging The possible misinterpretations of a close brother and sister co dependence the unexpected awakening of sisterly sexuality and the comic potential in such sibling rivalry for the affections of the same girl were all obvious subjects for refreshing comedic exploration yet which at every turn the movie frustratingly shies away from br br Instead the audience is subjected to a meandering series of uninspired and insipidly drawn situations with clichéd characterisations and dull performances from a cast struggling for belief and obviously in need of much tighter direction The lack of directorial control seems astounding on the one hand Moynahan Cavanagh and Spacek all give very pedestrian performances while Heather Graham and Molly Shannon the latter in particular veer towards embarrassing over compensation at times One could lay the blame for this on the director maybe Sue Kramer hopes that if her actors over act they will force a bigger laugh from the audience But then again the cast is a veteran one one would expect them to do better br br Sue Kramer really needs to think carefully what kind of movies she wants to make and for whom Given the possible issues Gray Matters alludes to and given her inability or unwillingness to fully explore them in the context of a comedy perhaps she should consider writing dramas instead I know it is never easy to make films about women and women s issues especially when one hopes to reach a wider audience than women alone but whatever direction she takes inconsequential and flimsy characters like Gray are not going to cut mustard
Sam Thomas Cavanagh and Gray Heather Graham are devoted siblings who share an apartment and a love of many things ballroom dancing 1940s movie musicals and much to their surprise an attractive woman named Charlie Bridget Moynahan Historically heterosexual Gray is confused by her new feelings br br Gray Matters proves to be one of the blandest films I have ever seen It s dull predictable unfunny poorly acted and poorly written Nothing about it felt real and everything was very cheesy Also this isn t really a romantic comedy with a special twist but more of a coming out movie Sue Kramer tried to make the first half cute with the romantic stuff and the second half serious with the actual acceptance and coming out part Unfortunately she failed miserably The first half was largely unfunny and only Heather Graham was able to hold it up a little Then the film took an awkward tone and got all serious The serious scenes were handled poorly and all of the emotions just felt phony br br I guess I would have enjoyed the film a little more if the relationships between the characters felt more authentic The brother and sister relationship was very weak and they didn t really appear to be that close Their relationship just didn t feel very natural Also the relationship between Tom and Bridget felt very unnatural If two people are going to get married after only knowing each other for less than a week then you would expect to see a little more excitement but the characters talked about getting married in Vegas in the same manner of asking a waiter what the specials are There was a lack of excitement in the film and it was hard to get involved with the movie with such unmotivated characters br br The acting was mostly weak which was a bit surprising given the decent cast Heather Graham gave the only good performance in the movie She was funny and had a few charming scenes but it s too bad that all of her co stars were complete duds Bridget Moynahan was very weak and her performance ringed false on every level Also it seemed like she was reading her lines Thomas Cavanagh was pretty wooden and he showed nearly no emotion The chemistry between Thomas and Heather was non existent and that damaged the film because their relationship felt phony I can usually rely on Molly Shannon to be funny in a supporting role but here she was just annoying Sissy Spacek had about two scenes and she was annoying in both of them Finally Alan Cumming just had an embarrassing character and his performance wasn t very good Overall Gray Matters is a lame film and it isn t worth watching Rating 3 10
If there has ever been a worse comedy than Gray Matters I am unaware of it The New York Jewish comedy s funny premise is that siblings Sam Gray are mistaken for a couple and so decide to fix Sam up with a girlfriend only to find that Gray is equally attracted to their target Charlie The revelation that Gray is secretly gay is apparently only a surprise to her There is a deeply offensive wedding sequence a deeply embarrassing drunk act from Moynahan and Graham and a performance that would embarrass forests everywhere for its woodenness from Tom Cavanagh Sissy Spacek demonstrates a complete inability to do comedy and will want this excised from her resume Molly Shannon plays the homely friend with lumpen insouciance Only Alan Cumming emerges with any credit but is seriously under employed and given nothing with which to work The whole disaster is cemented by Graham s bizarre eye rolling performance culminating with the penultimate scene where she wears a comedy hat and an overcoat despite the scene being set in a lesbian bar It is astonishing that this film was ever released it has no redeeming feature and should be avoided at all costs
It was obvious that this movie is designed to appeal to the Chick Flick audience to which i have sat through quite a few and enjoyed most However this was a very irritating attempt by Heather Graham to become the next Meg Ryan who became annoying as hell in her own right Her acting was overdone and it appeared that she was overanxious compared to her colleagues who were relaxed in their roles This film might have been more as there was suitable budget for settings actors and a decent story line My wife and I both agreed that this was Muck at the end as the film ended on a painful embarrassing high Better luck next time hope Miss Graham sticks to the type of films that she belongs in like From Hell
Otherwise it is one of the worst movies I ve ever seen and I mean ever My wife and I were both bored out of our minds within 10 minutes Not to mention being boring it is entirely unbelievable Women non lesbian don t bathe together nor do they accidentally kiss Brothers and sisters don t live together well into their 30s and run around swing dancing together and engaging in footraces in central park Men don t find out their wife and sister romantically kissed the night before the wedding and then never discuss it with said wife Absolutely ridiculous br br Heather Graham is possibly the worst actress in films today She smiles when she should be crying and vice versa The only movie she has ever been good in is Boogie Nights and that is because she wasn t acting br br I cannot stress enough how bad this movie was
After a promising first 25 minutes that makes you feel all warm inside you re pretty convinced that this will be a great romantic comedy Then the movie takes a turn for the worse br br The warm feeling might still be there but as others has said The plot becomes so unbelievable and artificial that it s almost unbearable to watch br br The movie gets sped up and you get the impression that you re either fast forwarding through it or that the producers decided to fit it in less than 1h40m and had to cut a lot of scenes out br br Realism isn t a goal onto itself but as a viewer I m pretty convinced that this comedy isn t intentionally unrealistic it just happens to be br br On the plus side this movie has a couple of nice interiors and despite the bad script I think that the actors performances are mainly good If I could rate the first 25 minutes only I d probably give it an eight As it is now it gets a four And that s being nice br br If you re a sucker for romantic comedies you ll probably have a great time anyways If not I d recommend that you watch something else
This was one of the worst movies I ve ever seen Horrible acting Not funny at all and well just boring br br I can only assume all these 10 out of 10 fav all time movie comments are actually the actors themselves in disguise br br Idk what the runtime on this movie is I m sure its listed on this page It certainly felt like an eternity br br If your looking for a tough challenge attempt to sit through this awful movie br br otherwise br br Don t waste your time as I did on this one
Here s one you can watch with a straight face with a script so bad even Will Ferrell wouldn t be in it br br There are two laughs in HOT ROD br br 1 The Punch Dance Rod needs to go to his quiet place and before anyone can say Kevin Bacon he is footloosing a passionate overwrought bodyswerve to the strains of a band who wishes they had the big hair faux metal chops of Europe br br 2 John Farnham s You re The Voice In one of those epic sequences where the star and his cohorts do The Slomo Walk down Main Street and the townfolk follow on their heels in support the soundtrack is the gag How did the film makers even come across this Aussie recording artist A major Australian vocalist and a genuine talent who shot to fame in the early 70s covering Raindrops Keep Fallin On My Head then disappeared until 1986 for The Big Comeback with You re The Voice John Farnham s anthem is so bewitchingly cheesy it leveled mountains in Switzerland br br Besides these two high points in the film both ruined anyway with the slipshod writing the rest of the film is like choking on someone else s vomit br br Andy Samberg is Rod a failed stunt jumper who has never made a jump Maybe it s got something to do with the fact he s driving a moped into the heart of darkness Or his fake mustache Yeh someone actually thought that was funny br br Without one jump under his starry belt he plans for a 15 bus extravaganza which would surely kill a lesser bad comedian like Jason Biggs or Rob Schneider to win the day and save his stepfather and simultaneously wipe out cancer and whatever who watches these movies for plot anyway Along the way as usual for moronic leads in these comedies he scores a salubrious chick Isla Fisher who must surely be retarded to consider swapping chromosomes with this loser br br Sissy Spacek CARRIE 1976 has so little to do she almost phoned in her performance then changed her mind and just hung up Ian McShane must ve lost a bet to be here
SNL is pretty funny but people who say this is like watching a Short skit on SNL is a little dumb minded It s NOTHING like SNL it s just a stupid piece of crap br br Andy Samberg tries to act like Jon Heder but fails Although Jon Heder is only funny in Napoleon Dynamite Andy tries his hardest and people think he s funny br br Only funny people in the movie were Danny McBride and Bill Hader The only part that was decently funny with Andy was the pool part br br They could have made the Quiet place a lot better if they didn t make the falling scene 3 freaking minutes br br The part where he s pronouncing his H s more is retarded They try going with it too long and half the time it looks like Andy is laughing while he acts he s a horrible actor and doesn t deserve to be in a movie br br This movie is a joke and is for the simple minded people with the brain of a 10 year old level of comedy Which is about half the United States
I ve seen a lot of crap in my day but goodness Hot Rod takes the cake I saw a free screening in NY the other night I can only hope they show the funny version to the paying customers The big laughs were sparse the plot was uninteresting and the characters were one dimensional at best One highlight is a hilarious dancing scene with Adam Samberg It was priceless and was the only scene I truly had a hearty laugh at Other than that I can only recollect randomness and dead air SNL Samberg fans may be disappointed I know I was expecting more from it But it short I definitely would not recommend attending a free screening or paying to watch this film
My family and I screened Underdog the night before And as bad as Underdog is my four year old loved it Hot Rod makes it look like Oscar worthy material The only thing that could have saved this movie was if Evel himself had come out of retirement to slap Samberg in the face for making this movie I will admit however that the soundtrack was good I wasn t sure if the movie was set in the 80 s but with the majority of the music coming from Europe Who knows If I were you I would take a pass And just stay at home and watch the test pattern on your local TV station Or if you are dead set on watching this people under the influence might enjoy it
Quite possibly the worst movie I ve ever seen I was ready to walk out after the first ten minutes The only people laughing in the theater were the tweeners Don t get me wrong I love silly stupid movies just as much as the next gal but the whole premise writing and humor stunk It seemed to me that they were going for a Napoleon Dynamite feel strange and random scenes which would lead to a cult audience Instead it ended up being forced awkward and weird br br The only bright light was Isla Fisher and I just felt utterly awful that she and Sissy Spacek had signed up for this horrible thing br br Thank gosh I didn t pay for it
By no means is this movie as bad as Perfect Stranger but it just wasn t funny It couldn t stick to one type of comedy it jumped from SNL to Adam Sandler esquire to romantic to little guy scores big to slapstick to Loser the movie types of comedies Although there were some pretty funny slapstick moments the fall down the hill no one was very particularly funny or outstanding in any way Schindler s List was funnier and felt shorter you never knew if Andy Samberg was supposed to be in high school a college dropout or just a loser living at home with his mother Sissy Spacek in her worst choice of roles And poor Ian McShane THE serious actor if I only had to name one is given crap to read into the camera The story drags and is completely predictable up to and including the end no spoilers here in case Adam Samberg s mom wants to see it Don t spend ANY money going to see this movie and maybe Lorne Michaels will get the hint and start producing quality Yes Wayne s World and Tommy Boy are quality movies
When viewing a movie as silly as Hot Rod one must sit back relax and alter one s intellectual capacity to a like state which is in this case a state dimwitted enough to endure brainless drivel that has somehow been mistaken for comedy With a brief runtime of 88 minutes this film was long past drawn out and buried itself beneath a bundle of repetitive jokes jokes that came at a minority and weren t even funny in the first place Hot Rod s base material is as superficial and irrelevant as 2004 s cult hit Napoleon Dynamite though it s much more contrived and comes without ANY of the laughter In fact the movie s blatant desperation to be compared to Napoleon Dynamite is scornful and offensive and left me ticked off instead of just being annoyed br br The movie if one were compelled enough to call it such poses a paltry story that puts self proclaimed stuntman Rod Kimble before us with the trifling intention of jumping fifteen buses one more than his idol Evel Knievel jumped so we re told by Rod and raising 50 000 dollars for his stepfather s impending life saving heart operation all so that he can fight his stepfather once recovered and gain his respect because in order to gain one s respect one must first fight them Huh Whatever Each character is no more interesting than Rod s stick on mustache and from the film s opening joke to its ridiculous conclusion each scene played like a nonsensical and terribly unfunny SNL skit which with the addition of an extra 85 minutes is essentially what Hot Rod strives to be br br The film s star Andy Samberg contributed an effort to the screen that observably exerted every last drip drop of his comedic capabilities Unfortunately rather realistically his humorous talents are no more admirable than a five year old retelling his own exhausted joke that somewhere includes the innocently crude poop and pee pee gags And if that s disappointing pull a chair hide your face in your hands and brace yourself for the real blow he IS the film s humor To rescue them of their mortification I ll willingly omit the ghastliness of Samberg s co stars roles and leave the second third of The Lonely Island team director Akiva Schaffer to his non existent talent as a director or a comedian Basically every thing one could possibly do to further trample a crash course comedy is perfectly portrayed here and done so arrogantly as though the film would be funnier that way Trick yourself into believing that there s even a single laugh in this heap or treat yourself to another movie ANY other movie
I got to see an early preview of this movie and I hope they have time to edit it in what ever way they can to improve on it before it comes out Aug 3rd It stars Andy Samberg from Saturday Night Live as Hot Rod Kimble He s plays a teenager in a small town who wants to be a stunt man like his late father When we meet him he s jumping a mail truck on his mo ped yes a mo ped and almost makes it This would be worthy of a Jackass movie if he wasn t honestly trying to do this Isla Fisher plays the slightly older and much more mature girl next door Denise She seems to like Rod enough to join his crew Jorma Taccone also SNL plays his half brother Kevin who documents the stunts with a camcorder Sissy Spacek plays Rod s mom Marie She remarried Frank Powell played by Ian McShane Frank s a real tough guy who enjoys beating Rod in some real drag out brawls It s clear that Rod s not going to earn Frank s respect till he can beat him We find out Frank needs a 50 000 heart transplant and Rod is determined to raise the money just so he can beat his ass once he s healed and prove himself a man A long fall down a mountain side convinces Rod to go big on one stunt Rod sets out to get seed money by charging for doing stunts that would make you cringe if you saw them in real life Like the human torch at a children s birthday party There were those at the showing who managed to laugh at most of the stunts Just when all hope and money is lost along comes a sponsor who saves the day by getting the 15 school buses Rod wants to jump He gets exclusive broadcast rights and sets up phone lines to get donations Rod gets a new outfit and a real motorcycle The whole town turns out and the world tunes in Does he make the jump Does he get the girl Do they raise the 50k Does Frank get his ass beat by Rod Wait till this 90 minute movie comes out on video to find out
Alright friends a serious movie buff is expected to watch all kinds of movie the bad as well as the good and this movie put me to the test I won t mince words This movie was bad The story was bad The acting was bad The always wonderful Sissy Spacek did nothing to make this movie better Indeed I asked myself why did I even bother to see this rotten trashy movie Why did I waste my time and money on something that I suspected would be bad The answer is of course that I am a movie buff and therefore cannot avoid what otherwise should be avoided I will not waste your time explaining what exactly was wrong with this amateurish movie except to say that the quality of the acting was to put it politely subpaar A serious movie buff may want to take on the responsibility of watching this movie Otherwise stay home don t waste your time read a book take take of chores or have yourself a good sandwich
If i could have rated this movie by 0 i would have I see some ppl at IMDb says that this is the funniest movie of the year etc etc excuse me are you ppl snorting LSD or There is absolutely NOTHING funny about this movie N O T H I N G I actually want my 27 minutes back of my life that i spent watching this piece of crap br br I read someone sitting on an airplane watching this movie stopped watching after 30 minutes i totally understand that i actually would have watched snakes on a plane for 2 times over instead of watching this movie once br br DO NOT watch this movie do something else useful with your life do the dishes walk the dog hell anything is better than spending time in front of the TV watching hot rod
This movie is one of the worst comedy movies i have ever seen I hate these Napoleon Dynamite rip offs Just face it people the dumb humor has been mastered already Make something new for once All these new comedies are just horrible And coming out of SNL Andy Samberg is not ready for a lead role yet I hope he can bounce back from this awful movie And Will Arnetts character is just plain bad Hey Will did you read the script The plot is truly the worst ever written Now you tell me if this is weird this is the movie Rod Kimble s step dad Frank is dying and the family needs 50 000 to pay for the heart surgery so Rod is planning this huge jump to raise money for Frank Only so that Rod can beat Frank in a fight and prove his manliness Yes thats the movie you tell me would u spend 7 00 to see that piece of crap br br 3 10 just horrible br br adam
So i had low expectations for this movie to start with but it failed to meet even those while there were some funny parts even one or two laugh out loud parts this movie fell terribly short of what i would call good the funniest jokes were unexpected and over very quickly leaving us sitting there going WTF just happened in addition there were a few jokes that just dragged on and on and on the part where he falls down the mountain had me yawning also the editing was really lacking there were some poor scene transitions but that seems to be the style nowadays It made me laugh but i wouldn t watch it again and I m very glad i waited for it to rent give it a chance you might enjoy it but don t think you are in for anything along the lines of the 40 year old virgin or Superbad
First off to give you some idea of my taste in movies br br 2007 Comedies I enjoyed Superbad Knocked Up Hot Fuzz Blades Of Glory br br 2007 Comedies I hated Evan Almighty The Brothers Solomon Good Luck Chuck br br I should have followed my first instinct and turned off Hot Rod after I got to about the 20 minute mark I knew by that point that this movie would not make me laugh once The script is absolutely brutal I have no idea how this monstrosity managed to crack 6 on IMDb Any one older than 10 years old who enjoyed this must be some kind of mental defective br br This doesn t come close to anything with Will Farrell and it s clear that Andy Samberg can t carry anything longer than a 5 to 10 minute sketch on YouTube or SNL I don t know how they roped Ian McShane and Isla Fisher into doing this movie they must have owed favors or something I came in knowing that it would be a dumb movie but I thought it would at least be funny I didn t so much as smirk br br I don t normally comment on movies at IMDb but this was so awful I just had to warn people This is only the 4th movie I ve seen that I ve felt compelled to rate 1 10
This is one of those movies which makes you think would Hulk The real American Hogan have done the same Frankly I don t think so and he d have been right I m Italian I cannot go proud of my country for many reasons but I wouldn t have rowed for another team The French for example simply because I m in love with Juliette Binoche Besides the protagonist doesn t fall in love desire with a British girl at the end of the movie but with a fellow countrywoman so why rowing against Yale As far as acting is concerned well all the players act very poorly And then you know I hated that Dead poets society atmosphere In fact that s another movie I hate
OK I know that the wanna be John Hughes movies of the 80s were all unilaterally flat so the expectations for this film ran pretty low br br Still after sitting through this crap there s one key thing I can t seem to get out of my head br br I just sat through an 80s Rob Lowe movie that had no nudity and only hints of sex in them br br The acting is awful the characters boring and flat the portrayal of Oxford an absolute insult and the rowing scenes unexciting uneventful and inaccurate br br Unless you ve got some wierd Ally Sheedy or Amanda Pays or I guess Rob Lowe fetish there s really no reason to see this one
I can fondly remember Bo Derek s heyday and the UK press attention the mucky Sun News of the World papers especially all following her small role in 10 with Dudley Moore Understandably much fuss was made of her photogenic face crystal clear blue eyes and her perfectly formed bouncing breasts br br Unfortunately acting is and never was her forte I think they should make one of the triple disc collections you always find in the bargain DVD bins Orca Tarzan the Ape man and Bolero All these films could be nominated for the So Bad They Are Great br br It would be a guilty must buy of mine Should you ever read your press or this comment Ms Derek please do not be offended ALways had a soft spot for you and there are more important things going on in the world to worry about than your acting ability Much Love x

Fairly amusing piece that tries to show how smart Orcas are but in the meanwhile and quite oblivious to them makes the audience feel stupid by making the most ridiculous film Richard Harris plays Quint I m sorry that s wrong he plays Captain Nolan a fisherman who catches sharks for a living but is lured by the big catch and tries to catch a killer whale When the capture of a female killer whale goes awry don t ask it s mate don t ask goes on a rampage don t ask and starts STALKING Captain Nolan Don t ask Soon Captain Nolan realizes that they have something in common don t ask Pretty amazing film making here folks I got to tell you though the beginning with the whale noises and nothing much else is pretty haunting and the end credits with the most godawful song is pretty entertaining
Please do not waste 2 hours of your life watching this movie just don t Especially if someone is fortunate to be snoozing at the side of you Damn cheek if you ask me I waited for something to happen it never did I am not one of those people to stop watching a movie part way through I always have to see it through to the end What a huge mistake Do yourself a favour and go and paint a wall and watch it dry far more entertaining Please do not waste 2 hours of your life watching this movie just don t Especially if someone is fortunate to be snoozing at the side of you Damn cheek if you ask me I waited for something to happen it never did I am not one of those people to stop watching a movie part way through I always have to see it through to the end What a huge mistake Do yourself a favour and go and paint a wall and watch it dry far more entertaining
I like monster movies generally Even if they are implausible and silly But its hard to like this movie when its so implausible and silly AND tries to take itself seriously all at the same time Like in a really posh kind of way br br While the idea is somewhat factual like Orcas are known for killing Great White Sharks its really hard to find it scary when I can t help but just see an angry Shamoo destroying stuff Especially that one scene where some building exploded cause of the Orca s doing and while it explodes the thing jumps out of the water and it felt like I was watching a show at Sea World with fireworks Plus they kill a lot of the scary moments before they even hint that they re going to happen On top of that it takes a few jabs at JAWS Its like hey look we re being factual and we can come up with BETTER reasons why the Orca is attacking br br Yes you are ignoring your outrageous ups in logic of course But JAWS had one thing your movie doesn t Its scary Yes its implausible Yes its somewhat outrageous But quite frankly factual or not a Killer Shark is not close to being as scary as a Great White And the poor attempt at character development and writing just hurts it more Even JAWS the Revenge is scarier than this
This is only a response to the yahoo who says this movie is more realistic than the classic genre defining MASTERPIECE Jaws Yes brainiac great whites and other species of shark bull black tip oceanic white tip tiger have been known to populate areas where easy prey is found Humans don t often make it onto that menu granted but the shark in the film was repeatedly pointed out to be exhibiting abnormal behavior It s not like it s never happened The odds of a killer whale destroying nearly a whole town singling out a human nemesis sinking several dozen thick hulled North Atlantic fishing boats and knowing when certain people all friends of the aforementioned nemesis are close enough to the water for it to reach are so slim as to be laughable Much like this turd of a Jaws knock off Laughable Great white sharks are also known to frequently chew on boats protective underwater cages and people on rafts and surfboards as they look like seals from below A shark the size of Bruce if you don t know look it up would be more than capable of sinking a boat like The Orca hey that s the name of the blatant rip off we re discussing as it would weigh upwards of 6 000 lbs I could go on but I don t need to Jaws is amazing better acting better effects better music better writing Orca is crap BLATANT rip off of Jaws lousy writing abominable effects most ridiculous plot this side of an Olson Twins flick It doesn t take a masters from Columbia University to see that Watch better movies
While I don t claim to be any sort of expert in marine life I must say anyone with a modicum of intelligence could not possibly buy in to this notion of a whale and not even the mother having a clue about revenge because it witnessed his dead mate having a forced abortion by humans I mean really This is basically the whole plot Richard Harris must have been extremely hard up for roles to have accepted this junk This is the kind of movie that is so bad that if you paid 50 cents to see it you would feel like demanding your money back
Without a doubt this is one of the worst pictures I ever actually paid money to see the kind of flick you choose out of desperation at the mall cinema during a Christmas holiday when you have missed the start times for anything good but still are dead set on seeing a movie And that is exactly how I came to see this stink bomb br br At the distance of the better part of three decades I can still smell the rotting fish that constitute this story line Unbelievable plot that a killer whale carries a grudge against an individual not of the sea is laughable And that s about all except for a completely out of place love theme that plays over the finish of a film devoid of a love story At least Charlotte Rampling is lovely in a two dimensional role but Richard Harris just chews up the scenery He was no Captain Quint Robert Shaw and this is no Jaws Mercifully I have put most of it out of mind and when I run across it on television air casts I move on immediately Danger Will Robinson See the current t v commercial showing a husband and wife whale watching Orca I love Orca at least it is over in sixty seconds This flick represents 92 minutes of my life that I will never get back
This film can t make up its mind whether its message is humans are evil and bad and animals are sweet and blameless or don t ever go in the water again A fisherman Nolan is out to nab a killer whale a very bad thing but when he accidentally ACCIDENTALLY mark you hits a pregnant cow instead of her mate the cow and I use the word in all senses who is obviously a sick psycho bitch and the canonical villain of the piece throws herself against the propellers trying to chew herself to bits in the most distressing and hideous not to mention ineffectual method of killing herself I doubt it was her first When her unborn fetus aborts from her hideous self inflicted wounds her mate goes mental with revenge and swears to hurt kill and mutilate every human who even so much as talks to Nolan Obviously as among humans total psychos date other total psychos br br The film reeks of half thought out anti human message the poor poor whale the evil men must suffer and die and yet it does not succeed in demonizing Nolan at all It s true that when he set out his motives were selfish and cruel but at the first squeal of the first whale he grows a heart and as the film progresses he grows more and more compassionate to the whale s pain until it seems he will walk out on the ice and give himself to the whale just to make it feel a little better br br The films final journey in which Nolan follows the whale on a bizarre journey to the north reminds me of Melville s eerie man whale connection and for a moment hinted at a truly interesting conclusion where these two husbands might connect understand even respect each other in their own grief for Nolan lost his wife and unborn child also to an accident It s clear Nolan respects the whale and feels for its loss However it never goes there The whale character has no compassion or respect for anyone br br The final scene loses this focus and becomes Jaws like where the sea monster finally kills everybody and Nolan and no doubt through an oversight fails to chomp up the whale hugger tho he made a good snap for her head a little earlier I love animals and I detest whaling and what is more I love orca whales but if this film s goal was to make me feel that the whale was the victim and that people are evil and detestable it completely failed Nolan shows compassion and growth and feels for others and all the whale thinks about is killing and maiming br br The only message one can walk away with is If you see an orca whale ever anywhere run the other way cause if you step on his FIN the wrong way he will hunt you to the ends of the earth destroying everything around you
Many have stated that Orca Killer Whale is a Jaws rip off This is not really true though the enormous commercial success of Jaws undoubtedly made these man vs beast stories more attractive propositions for film makers in the second half of the 70s Orca Killer Whale would be better described as a modern day retread of Moby Dick It s a story about obsession On one hand a whale s obsessive quest to avenge the death of its mate on the other a bounty hunter s obsessive quest to kill the whale before it can claim any more lives Sadly Orca Killer Whale emerges a very disappointing film its fundamentally interesting ideas somewhat ruined by hammy performances and preposterous plotting br br Shark hunter Nolan Richard Harris encounters a marine life researcher Rachel Bedford Charlotte Rampling diving off the Atlantic coast of Canada Their meeting almost ends in disaster when Rachel s team are attacked by a Great White Shark but a Killer Whale arrives in the nick of time to stop the shark After this Nolan becomes increasingly obsessed with capturing a Killer Whale and selling it to an aquarium But his plans backfire when he accidentally kills a pregnant female of the species while the distraught male looks on Rachel tells Nolan that a Killer Whale is an incredibly intelligent mammal with a strong memory and feelings just like a human Worse still native Umilak Will Sampson warns him that the whale will always remember its grief and do everything it can to have revenge Nolan initially tries to forget about the whole regrettable incident but the whale causes havoc in the fishing town and the disgruntled locals begin to demand that Nolan puts to sea to track it down and destroy it Eventually Nolan is forced to pursue the Killer Whale the hunt leads all the way to the desolate ice floes of the Arctic Ocean where man and beast play out their final fatal battle against each other br br Two things stand out in this film One is the haunting score by Ennio Morricone perhaps the greatest composer of film music of all time his talents wasted on various tenth rate clunkers during the 70s and 80s The other is the amazing widescreen photography of Ted Moore which makes the film consistently pleasing to the eye In every other department Orca Killer Whale is a shoddy film that does nothing to enhance the reputation of its talented cast and crew Harris appears extremely ill throughout the film his hair bedraggled black rings around his eyes and skin deathly pale His performance lacks the usual vitality Rampling strikes a lot of sexy poses but fails to convince with her long winded and ill informed explanations about the ways of whales The rest of the actors are wasted in brief and undeveloped roles the most memorable of which sees Bo Derek getting her leg bitten off by the vengeful whale The plot is total nonsense from start to finish with such preposterous sequences as the whale deliberately starting a fire in the fishing village that engulfs and destroys the local refinery Although it s credible to suppose that whales are intelligent creatures with genuine emotions the idea that a whale could plot revenge against a single human adversary and carry it out so calculatedly is utterly absurd Orca Killer Whale is really one for completists of the man vs beast cycle from the late 70s Most will come away from the film shaking their heads in disbelief and grinding their teeth with despair
I don t know who got the idea that orcas go around killing people and bashing and destroying things for revenge but my god is it absurd Orcas are most definitely not the cold blooded killer this movie makes them out to be its silly Orcas are extremely intelligent don t get me wrong but I highly doubt they know and understand a concept such as revenge So I have to say all I got out of this movie was the entertainment of how preposterous it was So I was at least somewhat amused by it Personally I d recommend going and seeing Jaws if you re wanting to see an Animal Killing Humans type of movie But if you re like me and want to laugh at something this far from realism then I d say go ahead D
ORCA is not exactly bad but it s not really Richard Harris s finest hour either As a demented Ahab like fisherman Harris gets into a game of death with a vengeful killer whale after killing the whale s wife and unborn child Charlotte Rampling plays a whale expert who gets involved with Harris She yells at him a lot about how important it is to leave nature alone He doesn t listen and somehow ends up in the arctic battling the revenge crazed whale There are no special effects to speak of except for what looks like a round mirror for a whale s eye there are endless shots of Harris reflected in the eye so the audience understands that the whale knows who he is Bo Derek as one of Harris s crew has a particularly unpleasant run in with the Orca and most of the supporting cast including Robert Carridine Will Sampson and Keenan Wynn don t fare very well either
Orca starts as crusty Irish sea captain Nolan Richard Harris his crew are trying to capture a Great White Shark so they can sell it for big bucks unfortunately when a hapless marine biologist called Ken Robert Carradine comes under attack from it the Shark is killed by a Killer Whale this raises Nolan s interest in Killer Whales decides he want s to catch one of them instead However while trying to do so he catches a pregnant female injuries it to the extent she aborts her unborn foetus on deck which makes a mess enrages her mate Nolan orders the Whale be dumped back in the sea which is what happens The male Killer Whale is annoyed to say the least kills one of Nolan s crew before they reach the dry land of Newfoundland in Canada once there the Killer Whale conducts a series of attacks on the town it s people in an effort to lure Nolan back out to sea for a fight to the death br br Directed by Michael Anderson I thought this blatant rip off was terrible I m sorry but I thought it was just plain ridiculous utterly dull even at a modest 90 odd minutes The script by producer Luciano Vincenzoni Sergio Donati is so stupid I m lost for words the fact that it seems to take itself very seriously doesn t help if I have to listen to Charlotte Rampling go on about how intelligent Killer Whale s are just one more time I ll scream I m sorry but I simply don t believe a Killer Whale is intelligent enough to know who any particular boat belongs to sink it I don t believe a Killer Whale can cause a huge explosion including knocking an oil lantern from a wall on the opposite side it hits as there is no way on earth it could know it was there I don t believe a Killer Whale can identify someone s house know someone is in there then wreck it on purpose I don t believe a Killer Whale can move icebergs around in order to trap a boat I don t believe Killer Whales can physically recognise people I don t believe it has any revenge instincts or at least none that are as strong as this dumb film makes out Maybe I m being a bit harsh I mean it s only a film after all but it s a film which is trying to be serious things just got so ridiculous that I was half expecting the Killer Whale to write a letter to Nolan to tell him his plan hand or should that be fin deliver it the thing seemed intelligent enough to do just about anything else They should have asked it to come up with a cure for the common cold Seriously that s a statement that s no more far fetched than anything else in this film I found the film very boring totally dull had awful character s with no on screen presence at all It goes without saying this is a Jaws 1975 rip off which doesn t even come close to Spielberg s classic br br Director Anderson is no Spielberg that s for sure this rubbishy film has absolutely no suspense scares tension or atmosphere at all All the attack scenes are as dull as dishwater totally forgettable there s no build up to them virtually no pay off either as Orca doesn t get to eat a single person Then there s the scenes which literally had me laughing the shots of the Killer Whale appearing to cry are pure comedy the opening scenes of the two Killer Whales I suspect tried to show them as a loving caring couple but I couldn t help but think that this is the closest we ll ever get to Killer Whale porn hilarious stuff The footage of the Killer Whales themselves is bland boring instead of footage which matches enhances the scenes around it it just looks like dreary wildlife documentary footage that has little connection to anything else Do you get the impression that I don t like this film Good Forget about any gore or decent deaths either there s a brief scene when Bo Derek has her legs bitten off but blink and you ll miss it br br This probably had quite a big budget it still sucks there s nothing outstanding about Orca it s well made I suppose but flat bland totally forgettable The cinematography is quite nice though The acting is bad Rampling is awful the late Harris Irish accent is embarrassing br br Orca is a lame Jaws rip off which completely ignores or messes up everything that made Spielberg s film so good this is one for bad movie lovers everywhere Definitely not recommended although not quite as bad as Jaws The Revenge 1987
Is it a coincidence that Orca was made two years after Jaws Orca isn t exactly a Jaws rip off but it is obvious that it tried to profit from Jaws s success First of all Orca in my opinion was a bad movie not terrible but definitely not good average at best br br The plot is basically a male killer whale orca after seeing its mate and its unborn calf killed by a fisherman seeks revenge I couldn t stand to watch this movie again The direction of this film is poor and when compared to Jaws it looks like the director producers and writers were almost talentless br br As for the acting it was very average and believable however the actual characters aren t the least bit likable The effects were alright for its time and the footage of the killer whale looked pretty good br br The violence is confusing bloody and not recommended for more sensitive people The music is overdone and very loud drowning out the sound effects and irritating at times I hated the way they exaggerated the intelligence of the killer whale killer whales don t mate with only one mate as depicted in Orca br br Overall this movie was bad poor in my opinion because of the reasons listed above Some people may appreciate this film more because of the concept of vengeance amongst animals and humans so I m not going to bash this movie and I can understand why some people may like it br br My Rating 3 5 10 but for its concept possibly a 5 10
Everything about this film was terrible To start with this film had a pretty good cast and I find it impossible to make such a great cast into the biggest disaster to the gangster film genre ever The sound track was like one of a very bad slap stick comedy It had this music through the whole film and it started to get quite irritating br br PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DO NOT INFLICT YOURSELF WITH THIS DISASTER YOU WILL ONLY BE HURT
Definitely not worth the rental but if you catch it on cable you ll be pleasantly surprised by the cameos Iman s appearance is especially self deprecating It s also an opportunity to watch all the male supporting cast members from The Sopranos typecast themselves
This relic of a short film starts with a teen going through the process of attempting to get a driver s license It quickly becomes sidetracked with just about every imaginable topic relating to cars br br Such things as dune buggies drag racing custom paint jobs and car shows are discussed It often attempts to be humorous but instead the film is dull drawn out and even sexist at times None of the people in the film are actually heard Instead everything is done in narration and voiceovers Sorry but I can t stand that br br There is nothing educational or interesting about Dad Can I Borrow The Car It s just another piece of mindless filler to take up time on their Wonderful World Of Disney TV show 1 10

I watched this film on the Hallmark Channel recently In my opinion the film started out decent enough but eventually got sour br br The Story A U S soldier in Afghanistan receives one of the Christmas cards that a woman back in the U S has sent out to troops for Christmas He becomes so inspired by the Christmas card that he feels it has given him a ray of hope and happiness in his life a motivation to continue on When he is given leave he goes to the very town that the woman lives in He comes across and spunky young woman and eventually finds out that she is the one that sent the Christmas card He meets the family and after saving her dad a Vietnam War Veteran from getting hit by a car whilst crossing the street the family decides to take him in for a while We learn that he doesn t have a family back home The soldier agrees to help out the family during the Christmas season by working with them at their logging company The family comes to love him and vice versa The soldier also becomes in love with the family s daughter the woman that sent the Christmas card There s only one problem She already has a serious relationship with a man that she s in love with It s also a long distance relationship The boyfriend is very different from the soldier He prefers wine and trips to France over hard labor and the great outdoors The woman prefers the latter Throughout the rest of the film there is a love triangle as the woman s boyfriend is back in town visiting her for the season Everyone in the family seems to want the daughter to be with the soldier and the mom basically wants what s best for her daughter SPOILER ALERT The woman comes to like the soldier more and more as they have a lot in common They happen to spend a lot of time together She gradually becomes attracted to his persona Then one day he kisses her and and she kisses him back Now she s so confused She s in love with her boyfriend and wants to marry him someday but she s become so fond of the soldier Soon enough the boyfriend who doesn t know about the kiss but is very protective of the woman and thinks the soldier has been trying to move in on her decides to propose to the woman and she accepts His plans for their marriage however are not plans that she wants She wants to be at home have kids and be close to her family He wants to travel the world go to exotic places and if they have kids he wants to take them along This doesn t sound too thrilling for the woman However the soldier feels bad about what he s done and doesn t want to make things worse So he decides to leave town despite the dad s urging him to stay and be with his daughter It all comes to a head when at the Christmas Eve service with Church we find out that the soldier hasn t left yet The boyfriend and the woman speak to each other outside and he broken hearted basically decides to let her go and breaks up with her The film ends with the woman and the soldier getting together br br Things I like I like the soldier throughout much of the film He s basically nice and polite with a strong sense of doing good for others there are moments in which the family is going with Church and participating in charitable causes the family hold hands and pray during an evening meal at the table the dad and mom have a long lasting and evidently healthy marriage the soldier tries to do the right thing in a situation after he did something very wrong br br Things I don t like There is a very typical love triangle story in this film the soldier turns sour as he slowly and subtly moves in on the woman and then eventually kisses her when she already has a boyfriend most of the family practically applauds this behavior the family goes with Church and participates in services yet this is how they act there is some bad language br br Conclusion I became disappointed as the film ran on and it got worse and worse I ended up fast forwarding the very end of the film because I had enough So the film started out decent with some few gem moments but ended up ruining itself Therefore I don t recommend this film to anyone

I m stunned that the reviewers IMDb gave this TV film as a high a rating as they did It s an innocuous sweet uncomplicated cliché of a film that had two big names from the past in it both of whom did a decent job but this film reeks of the low budget work we can see any day of week on the lesser cable channels I like a good romance as well as anyone but as my wife and I were watching this and before we saw the rating we said There are people who are going to rate this film too highly simply because there s nothing in it to challenge their brains their faith their comfort level or their cultural preferences It s possible to make a good film like that and Away from Her is an example but this was amateur hour There are some quite good films rated much lower than this one Truly another in a long line of woefully inadequate holiday films Watch The Family Stone It s miles ahead of this schlock
This film deserves another bad review Consider one reviewer extolling the film s virtues that include no sex violence or gore Uh excuse me The very set up of the film has us watching as Cody s young comrade with love of life and who has everything to live for is blown to bits leaving Cody holding his lifeless bloody body And given the nature of war we know that Cody has seen horror on almost a daily basis So much for those viewing this film with such rose glasses that the violence which defines Cody s persona is erased from viewer memory br br Sans any family of his own Cody like John Rambo roams the country on his bike making the long trek to hometown USA in the guise of some place called Nevada City No mention no realization of the clear fact that Cody is damaged goods We know this since his CO practically declares him so as he order Cody to get some rest away from the death and destruction of war This explains as none seem to notice or care Cody s obvious flat effect It is not bad acting It is the flat effect of post traumatic stress disorder Not guessing here remember his CO ordered him off the battle field br br How about that accidental kiss as noted by another review The fall was an accident the kiss was not How exactly was Cody respecting Faith by hitting on her knowing full well she was spoken for Now that was a non family value moment A moment which is then announced to the immediate universe as if posted on YouTube Of course faith s lapse of fidelity as well as Cody s coming on to a woman who plans to marry another is received in the spirit of the Xmas season all CHEERING their cheaten hearts and lips br br We know little about Faith s fiancé except that she professes her love for him she takes no longer than a nano second to accept his proposal could have waited if any second thoughts he is generous he loves her to death the family has nothing really against him he believes marriage is based on compromises and the two have never discussed post marriage plans No evil doers here br br Asner is a fine actor given over the hill dialogue like we love you son You are part of our family literally days after they have met a stranger named Cody And the band of brothers speech where the phrase was above all never intended to apply to virtual strangers off the battle field br br Bottom line This film is cotton candy Xmas fluff that betrays itself in major ways Most grossly when it applauds Cody s disrespect for Faith by physically hitting on her knowing full well she is spoken for By re defining family as we know it to wit accepting a virtual stranger as a full fledged loving member of the family because we all love you How many of you have done that or know anyone who has done that NOT
Watched this with my girlfriend after stumbling over it while zaping channels br br I guess we both hoped for some kind of happy family cute Christmas movie but were extremely disappointed br br the actor playing the soldier seems to have 0 emotion whatsoever his face looks the same whether he s chopping down Christmas tree s seeing the girl he loves being kissed by her boyfriend or when he s happily surprised by the girl he loves he s an awful actor and at no pont did any of us do nothing but laugh at him br br Then there s the cute blond girl blessed with the ability to count dot s and cheat on her boyfriend what a catch and her ambition in life is to live with her parents and count more dots br br So it s basically a story about a guy without any emotion or feelings who falls for a guy who count dots and cheats on her boyfriend it s as predictable as it get s and really a waste of time you gain nothing by watching this other than some weird laughs because it s all so corny br br I love it when her dad says that he only eats french fries and not french wine and they all laugh that s the hillbilly attitude this movie is about furthermore if my girlfriends dad were bossing me around like i d tell him a thing or to but not our army veteran no sir he let s everyone boss him around br br The movie is what First Blood would have been if John Rambo were burn like the biggest wimp in the world
If they could get Ed Asner why didn t they get other actors instead of people who go to the same church as the producers And why did the protagonist throw the wise old sage character to the ground when he was never in danger It forced the old guy to mask the injury out of pride and so the young guy would feel guilty leaving him with a life long disability I guess thats why the main character refuses money though and why the old guy works him like a dog even when he volunteers for extra work If the d bag boyfriend is a bad guy because he is long distance boyfriend then why is a soldier any better He has good reason to be jealous good reason to get her away from her hometown and over protective controlling manipulative father All the characters that are meant to be likable aren t and everyone else is the bad boyfriend How did they meet anyway a wine broker and a saw mill worker
It at all you have seen when harry met sally then avoid this one It will not only make you bang your head on the table as why can t bollywood even make a good remake but also annoy you with the so called funny moments in it The charm of the movie is missing Ranee looks terrible Saif tries to act like he is one hell of an actor The plots that have been picked up from the original don t look effective either The part where both of them bring their friends along and they hit a note it just doesn t look appealing What can be more disastrous you wanna waste some money this is what you can get Otherwise put some more bucks and watch the original Its too good to miss
I was fully amped up to see this film I had been waiting a year for it to be cleared down here in New Zealand I shouldn t have built myself up so much because it was so disappointing and is without a doubt Clark s worst film There is so much wrong with this film First off some of the acting is great in particular Nick Stahl as The Bully and the girl with the curly brown hair I can t recall her name but most of it was so out of touch and incredibly unbelievable especially Leo Fitzpatrick He s a veteran of Clark s films now and he was so brilliant in Kids but in Bully he invests his lines with such solemnity as to turn his scenes into a parody virtually The screenplay felt like it had been written by a first year film student No sorry a high school student one who has never seen a movie before And I couldn t fathom Clark s intentions Was he trying to point out the meaningless of these kids existence It sure as hell didn t stop him getting in a damn good perv I m no prude but I didn t need to see teenage breasts and buttocks every 5 minutes I still maintain that Clark s best film is Another Day in Paradise It s fantastic and I don t think he ll ever top it
Is it just me or is that kid really annoying br br Hideos sister spends most of her time running around after the disobedient little so and so As for him well I know he s a kid n all but his acting ability is about as wooden as a dead tree So far I m only half way through and am fascinated by the story but the people in it let it down I just hope it gets better by the end as I can t not know what it s all about Although some supposedly cryptic messages in the scribbles on the wall and a notebook indicate everything is backwards i e Dog is God Live is Evil etc just seems a little obvious at the moment yet nobody mentions its obvious meaning As yet anyway If my opinion changes at the end of the movie I ll update this post but if your reading this then well See above statement
Forbidden Siren is based upon the Siren 2 Playstation 2 so many 2s game Like most video game turned movies I would say the majority don t translate into a different medium really well And that goes for this one too painfully br br There s a pretty long prologue which explains and sets the premise for the story and the mysterious island on which a writer Leo Morimoto and his children daughter Yuki Yui Ichikawa and son Hideo Jun Nishiyama come to move into The villagers don t look all too friendly and soon enough sound advice is given about the siren on the island to stay indoors once the siren starts wailing br br Naturally and slowly things start to go bump and our siblings go on a mission beating around the bush to discover exactly what is happening on this unfriendly island with its strange inhabitants But in truth you will not bother with what s going on as folklore and fairy tales get thrown in to convolute the plot even more What was really pushing it into the realm of bad comedy are its unwittingly ill placed out of the norm moments which just drew pitiful giggles at its sheer stupidity until it s explained much later It s one thing trying to come up and present something smart but another thing doing it convincingly and with loopholes covered br br Despite it clocking in under 90 minutes I think it s a horror movie phenomenon to have that as a runtime benchmark it gives that almost two hour feel with its slow buildup to tell what it wants to Things begin to pick up toward the last 20 minutes but it s a classic case of too little too late br br What saves the movie is how it changes tack and its revelation at the end Again this is a common device used to try and elevate a seemingly simple horror movie into something a little bit extra in the hope of wowing an audience It turned out rather satisfactorily but leaves a bad aftertaste as you ll feel cheated somewhat There are two ways a twist will make you feel it either elevates the movie to a memorable level or provides you with that hokey feeling Unfortunately Forbidden Siren belonged more to the latter br br The saving grace will be its cinematography with its use of light shadows and mirrors but I will be that explicit it s still not worth the time so better to avoid this
Because some people like me like to know EVERYTHING about a movie even if they plan to see it including the ending Anyway here s the ending as I remember it because I couldn t have been more than 8 yrs old when I saw it for the first and only time on TV But I ll tell ya it sure scared the little kid that I was and I thought about it for days afterward and it still stands out in my mind to this day even though some of the details are a little vague Abe Vigoda was in this movie I don t remember that I didn t even remember that ol Barnabus was in this movie and I LOVED Dark Shadows So at the end the lead character Belinda Montgomery is lured by the Judge Joseph Cotton I m guessing even though I remember it as him being an old family physician or something instead of a judge see how memory fades to the wedding place which as I remember it is in a cavern of some kind Maybe I ve got that wrong and Shelley Winters is there laughing and the Judge has a cape on and the camera angle is kind of looking up at him and he throws back the cloak and he has goat legs and he announces he s actually her father the Devil and she s played right into their the satanic cult s hands because the mortal guy she has fallen in love with I guess that s Robert Foxworth turns out also to be the guy Satan wants to marry her off to The Demon with Yellow Eyes and yep sure enough they show Robert Foxworth and his eyes glow yellow There are a lot of close ups in the last few minutes of the film Everyone is laughing and rejoicing except for Belinda Montgomery who is very unhappy and cries or screams or something and that s the end The bad guys win
The best Laurel and Hardy shorts are filled to the brim with mishaps accidents and destruction mostly caused by Stan but with Ollie receiving the bulk of the punishment see the great The Music Box 1933 or Towed in a Hole 1932 as some some classic examples br br Here however for some reason is it because it was based on a sketch by Stan s father the boys play it straight in a comedy built around jokes and supposedly funny situations It doesn t come off It s merely another third rate tedious 30s comedy heightened only by the personalities of Stan and Ollie who never really display any of their trademarked gestures Ollie s finger wiggling Stan s blank stares etc or comic abilities br br The film begins with them running from the police Since we never see or know why it s hard to believe or accept their fear of being caught and thus hiding in Colonel Buckshot s mansion The premise for the humor Ollie passing himself off as the Colonel and Stan passing himself off as both the butler and the maid are never very engaging They are not playing Stan and Ollie in this film Their parts could have been played by any of the pedestrian studio actors and it would be just as poor br br Stan could mime and make whatever he would do funny but he doesn t get the chance to do any of that here He s constrained by uttering too much dialog to move the plot but none of it rises much above the silly We are treated to endless third rate comedy chestnuts such as the running gag of not correctly pronouncing Lord Plumtree s name the Call me a cab Okay you re a cab joke cops losing their clothes and being seen in long johns and a non sequiter ending of Stan and Ollie as the two parts in a painfully obvious horse costume as they make their escape on a bicycle for two and James Finlayson is still doing his silent era full body takes and Keystone Kop jumping jacks br br Stan and Ollie do much better in a situation comedy in Sons of the Desert 1933 where we get to see them do what we love about them be themselves In fact 1932 34 seem to be their best years br br Since this film does not play to any of their strengths why bother with it I have to give it a 3
It s hard to imagine that anyone could find this short their favorite if they have seen most of their shorts but I know that humor is VERY subjective I have seen all of their sound shorts by far the best of their stuff IMO and I found this one of their weaker efforts br br In the year this was made 1930 Stan and Babe made 15 shorts and one feature They were extremely popular and their boss Hal Roach took full advantage by keeping them working constantly In addition this was a time of experimentation for the writers and Stan I would say this was an experiment that really did not work As someone else said it does not play to their strengths Too much dialog and plot br br The best part of this one for me is the largely improvised sequence with Stan as Agnes the maid and the great Thelma Todd talking about girl stuff br br If you really want to see the boys at their most creative and funny check out Blotto or Brats From the same year br br They made so many shorts in such a short time that I think they can be forgiven for turning out a few less then par shorts They made something like 108 films altogether Very few except for the ones made at FOX were outright failures but there are some County Hospital Me And My Pal The Live Ghost The Fixer Uppers come to mind as essentially weak ones But other then those I find something wonderful in just about all their shorts Quite a record in my book br br If you have seen and enjoyed all their other shorts then by all means check this one out but I would be willing to bet that this one was less then memorable to Stan and Babe
In the U S very few films have been made about Rome that were not set in the time of Julius Caesar or shortly thereafter Hollywood s sword and sandal epics mostly have a Christian theme which makes it difficult to get into earlier Roman history Spartacus was probably the first exception to this rule and encountered some resistance in Hollywood because it did not have Jesus in it br br It s interesting to see at least one picture that not only takes place before the time of Caesar and Christ but is set when Rome was only one city among many on the Italian peninsula and had just ousted the hated King Tarquin and formed the Republic br br However this is not a historical film it s peplum and while the production values aren t rock bottom the acting and characterizations are cardboard I can only imagine what the dialogue was like in Italian but with wooden English dubbing it s very campy I got a few good laughs out of it at first br br I haven t seen many films of this genre having missed most of the Hercules movies of the 60s It s amusing up to a point but as the film goes on it gets somewhat boring br br One thing s for sure if I d seen this movie when I was ten years old I would have loved it At that age I went for anything with Romans and swordfights in it So at least this flick brought back some childhood memories
I have to agree with most everyone s opinion that this show was poorly produced as well as written The acting was not much more above the lower production values however I feel an actor can only rely on the material provided to them and make the best of it In keeping with this thought I feel it is important to point out that one actor has risen and persevered well beyond this campy to tasteless production to have become a respectable and quite talented performer I am referring to Laura Harris a Canadian born actor who has etched her way through many poorly produced shows and movies to find a place on the HBO hit Dead Like Me where she plays the role of Daisy Adair and to her credit she handles this role in an efficient manner I remember having a typical boyhood crush on the young actress during this series where she played Ashley a soft spoken yet intelligent 7th grader I felt as though if anyone might make it from this series it surely would be Laura Harris and true to her nature she did excel in the acting field to win the respect of many producers who now recognize her for her talent as well as unique Nordic blond allure If you ever do have the opportunity to view this series I recommend that you have something epic to watch after wards such as the Godfather or perhaps Beaches in order to remind yourself that there is after all a great deal of true production integrity and value out there and that this series is only a low budget reminder of what Laura Harris can simply state about her time on the show and I bet she would quote many a young actors words of defense by saying It s a start
This is a fascinating film especially to old movie buffs and historians I am both During the first half of the twentieth century sadly Black Americans were usually not allowed into White theaters As a result theaters catering to Black audiences wanted to show films reflecting the Black experience and showing Black actors In many cases the films were essentially similar plot wise to standard Hollywood fare but with a much much lower budget and usually horrid production values You really can t fault the film makers they just didn t have the money and resources available to the average film company As a result they had to make due with a lot less including an over reliance on stock actors that were seen again and again no money for re shooting scenes and a need to get the films done FAST This film tried very hard to be a Black version of a Gene Autry film starring Herb Jeffries instead Jeffries was a light skinned man from mixed ancestry and he starred in several similar cowboy films In each he sings a little fights a little though VERY poorly and loves a little everything you need in a cowboy Believe it or not Jeffries is STILL alive at age 96 br br The general plot was indiscernible from an Autry picture complete with anachronistic items such as telephones out West The problem is that despite its similarities the low budget shines through Stymie from the Li l Rascals flubbed a few lines but they just left it in the fight scenes were totally unchoreographed and were among the worst ever put on film there were some odd plot holes there was no background music leaving the film strangely quiet and the acting was pretty awful br br Now this does NOT mean that the film isn t worth seeing only that it abouts with technical problems that prevent it from being scored higher One reviewer oddly scored this film a 10 How this can be with all the problems is beyond me However I can understand a person liking the film despite its many problems The plot is generally pretty good the characters likable the musical numbers excellent and you know that the people making the film tried so darn hard AND it s a very important piece of American history But a 10 br br By the way in an odd bit of casting the very tall lean and almost white skinned Jefferies is paired with short dumpy and exceptionally dark Mantan Moreland as his brother Also Spencer Williams may be familiar to you He played Andy on TV s Amos n Andy
How can a major German TV station broadcast a mess like this It s amazing how the main actors avoid every acting talent Even the well known Gottfried John is acting very poor especially in the double murder scene how amateurish The screen plan is very very extended perhaps to fill out 2 parts of the movie Be careful not to fall asleep while watching The set is obviously very often a blue screen f g the scenes on the ship with unreal sea in background In the German version the sound and the dubbing is very poor probably reason different languages of actors but other international productions do handle this much more professional Advice Do NOT watch it s a diabolic waste of time
Störtebeker is truly one of the worst TV mini series ever made on this planet br br The acting is unbearable and the historic background is mostly nonsense Just two examples Visby was shown as a village of three houses Instead it was a major city at this time it s best days already passed by Secondly Hamburg would have never been the city taking care of pirates in the Baltic Sea Hamburg had no access to the Baltic Sea the major town at that time was Lübeck br br But worse than all that The directing How can a dilettante like this guy be allowed to direct a movie like this Impossible There was not a single believable scene it the fights were ridiculous and I could not suppress laughter at most stern scenes br br I can t understand at all how a major television station could be so incompetent
Richard Dix is a big not very nice industrialist who has nearly worked himself to death If he takes the vacation his doctors suggest for him can he find happiness for the last months of his life Well he ll likely be better off if he disregards the VOICE OF THE WHISTLER br br This William Castle directed entry has some great moments the introduction and the depiction of Richard Dix s life through newsreel a la Citizen Kane and some intriguing plotting in the final reels Dix s performance is generally pretty good But unfortunately the just does not quite work because one does not end up buying that the characters would behave the way that they do Also the movie veers from a dark and fascinating beginning to an almost cheerful 30s movie like midsection full of nice urban ethnic types who don t mind that they aren t rich and back again to a complex noir plot for the last 15 minutes or so br br This is a decent movie worth seeing but it needed a little more running time to establish a couple of the characters and a female lead capable of meeting the demands of her role
This was one of the lamest movies we watched in the last few months with a predictable plot line and pretty bad acting mainly from the supporting characters The interview with Hugh Laurie on the DVD was actually more rewarding than the film itself br br Hugh Laurie obviously put a lot of effort into learning how to dance the Samba but the scope of his character only required that he immerse himself at the kiddie end of the pool The movie is based on the appearance of a lovely girl and great music but these are not sufficient to make good entertainment br br If you have never seen Rio or the inside of a British bank this film is for you 2 out of 10
an acted manipulated documentary about one of the most darkest places of guatemala portrayed as a fun secure but sad place were a bunch of sex workers get to play in a soccer team assembled in what seems like no more than a week the documentary s main focus is to prove that society repels this kind of workers even though no solution to these poor women is ever achieved except that the people who documented this made them some sort of stars just like the title says so in exchange of being exploited for making this realityshowlike documentary it does have however its own documented reality but that sadly has nothing to do with the main storyline i would not accept to see it again but i would recommend it for general cultural purposes only
This warning against anti semitism is well meant and may have had its purpose at the time but it is made without the slightest notion of how to make a film The director has no idea about mise en scene the cast varies from bad till even worse br br The great Austrian comic Hans Moser is wasted In his part he ends in an asylum for the crazy that is designed as a set from Das Kabinett des Dr Caligari one wonders whether the makers had all their mental capabilities br br The restored copy I saw Dutch Filmmuseum gives the impression that some scenes were not put into the right place but may be the original editing was bad as well
Gadar is an example of one of Bollywood worst overrated movies ever Directed by Anil Sharma who prefers making period related movie gives a rubbish movie The songs were boring and ain t the kind of song you want to listen to in your car full volume Sunny Deol is famous for making daft movies where he beats up a 100 bad guys on his own He even kicks a metal jail door Indian and kicks a moving car far away Teesri Aankh I can give another 50 examples of disgraceful action by Sunny Deol But I m sure most people know this already Sunny gives a pathetic performance once again repeating the same type of role A guy claiming to be fighting for his countries piece by using violence Amisha Patel is hands down dead sexy with an amazing body that i would love to bone But even she couldn t save the film from being a disaster Instead of wearing sexy clothes like she usually does in this movie she doesn t Maybe cos she was playing a Muslim but she doesn t act like one in the movie Overall this is a poor show all the way I m sure it will appeal to some people who love seeing the Bollywood actor beat up 100 guys Give me a break
Gadar is a really dumb movie because it tells a fake story It s too unrealistic and is a typical sunny deol movie that is aimed to bash Pakistan The movie s aim is to misguide the viewers so they can think that Pakistan and it s government is bad but trying to hide their own flaws won t work And all the songs and music of the movie are all bad Most likely the Sikhs will love th movie cause they are being misguided The movie sucks and sucks with power I think only Amisha Patel was good in the movie If i can give 0 out of 10 I would but the lowest is 1 Please save 3 hours of your life and do not watch this stupid boring movie Disaster
This move is slow plodding cold dark and without a plot or hope It follows that tried and true European formula that they love to subsidize that is never seen but that the critics think makes an important point br br The movie is valuable if nothing more than to show the huge difference in the thinking between Americans and Europeans regarding employment In this movie the men are still nursing their wounds from years ago and feel it s the government s duty to provide them with work Whereas in the U S we know we have to go out there and create value for someone br br Spain never looked so backward
A romanticised and thoroughly false vision of unemployment from a middle class artist with a comfortable upbringing It is clear that the writer director never suffered unemployment directly and certainly has no personal experience of it If you had to believe this absolutely ridiculous story unemployed men of all ages behave like teenagers have no anger no fear no frustration etc All the characters live trough the day by carrying pranks boyish jokes They do never look for work the do almost never experience rejection or anguish etc Living on the dole is just about like a summer vacation from school Ridiculous Specially if you compare it with contemporary masterpieces from the likes of Ken Loach etc
This movie is painfully slow and has no plot It conveys the lives of a group of laid off boatworkers One of the older ones is sincere in his attempt to get a job There may be some social commentary here but it is muddled as nobody is painted in a very sympathetic light br br I do not understand why it had a 7 8 when I decided to watch it I watched the whole tedious thing and built expectations for a huge redeeming payoff No luck The IMDb rating has always been such a good match for my tastes Anything above 6 5 was worth watching br br And my wife says Javier Barem does not even look good in this movie He s not my type so my agreement does not mean much br br Sigh I give it a 1
Quentin Crisp once stated that when things are shown too beautifully one is a romantic When things are show unbearably grim they are realistic And when something gets the ironic treatment they re spot on Unfortunately for Leon de Aranoa he falls into the second catagory This director has obviously tried too hard to make a Spanish Ken Loach type movie without being able to capture the comedy and warmth between the characters that elevate Loach movies from merely being depressing Los Lunes al Sol is just that only depressing Things are unrealistically grim The characters ultimate moments of misery all reach a climax at the same point and if the glum story isn t enough Aranoa washes the tale over with a visually grey and grimy colour palette The films was ridiculously over rated at the Goyas A movie that shows empathy for the weaker citizens in society in this case unemployed harbour workers does not automatically make for a good movie even though I would be the first to sympathize with the fates of these people This movie only manages to make me grow disinterested in their fate In 21st century Spain unemployed people do not live like beggars and the public transport ferries have decent restrooms and it s hard to come across a bar with so few punters and such little happiness to be encountered in it Leon de Aranoa obviously doesn t have a clue about working class Spain and does it no favours Pretentious is the only conclusion I can draw The scene where the men watch a football match for free has been directly copied from a film which deals much more realistically with the subject of the poverty trap namely Purely Belter which is afar more engaging humorous and yet sad
AKA Mondays In The Sun br br I have no idea what I just watched Three men wander aimlessly and drink grousing about everything and at everyone in their path This is supposed to be a drama but what it is is a total waste of film without a single redeeming quality br br I have read reviews touting the performances herein as wonderful beautiful and heroic I m afraid I cannot agree unless these men were supposed to come off as the dumbest most ignorant proto humans who ever walked br br All in all This was not a movie It wanders throughout and loses everyone but the audience I ve watched this three times and cannot for the life of me see what anyone sees in this garbage There is nothing profound here whatsoever It s crap br br It rates a ZERO 10 from br br the Fiend
This picture reminds me of a Keneth More picture from 1957 called The Admirable Crighton whilst on the boat he was a servant and on the island he became the master and upon being saved reverted back to servant Madonna did OK in some movies however this one doesn t fire If there is any picture that show Madonna can t act it is this one br br I am not sure whether this was a subtle copy of The Admirable Crighton but it sure looks like it and if thats the case then Hollywood must be running out of ideas and that is sad to provide a platform for actors to improve their career profile and just on that this fails in every corner and detail br br The plot is loose and the acting is mediocre The script should have been put thru the shredder before taking it on location While many here have canned Madoona for all her acting I think that in films like A League of Their own was quite good and enjoyable and Who s That Girl showed a quirkiness of Madonna s style not shown before or afterwards Other Madonna films are not as enjoyable and I would have liked a to see a Madonna Animation series with the character from Who s That Girl I like the music from these two films however Swept away remains at the bottom of the pile here and will remain so br br everyone has a bomb right
This film story is bad enough which can happen in real life I m very can not understand when they show us this bad film I say it was bad because there is some reason 1 if Madonna was rich and can do everything she want then why she falling in love with that bad man 2 How can the story script is so weak She was so rich can do everything she want but not dare to divorce her husband that is very impossible br br The words I LOVE YOU it doesn t meant anything in this film
Guy Ritchie s noble effort is beat up knocked down raped kicked around shot stabbed spit upon punched sodomized and abused and left for dead by Madonna s dreadful performance Her acting was very reminiscent of a graduate from the Al Gore School of Dramatics and Public Speaking Guy Ritchie did do a somewhat noble attempt to remake this and if you exclude ALL of the scenes that his wife was in it s a fair movie at best I think that the best acting job ever had to be Guy comforting his wife that her performance was good enough not to re shoot If you have an opportunity of watching Swept Away or clipping your toenails for 89 minutes go for the extended pedicure
Whatever possessed Guy Ritchie to remake Wertmuller s film is incomprehensible br br This new film is a mess There was one other person in the audience when I saw it and she left about an hour into it I hope she demanded a refund The only reason I stayed through to the end was because I ve never walked out of a movie br br But I sat through this piece of junk thoroughly flabbergasted that Madonna and Ritchie could actually think they made a good film The dialogue is laughable the acting is atrocious and the only nice thing in this film is the scenery Ritchie took Lina s movie and turned it into another Blue Lagoon br br This is a film that you wouldn t even waste time watching late night on Cinemax Time is too precious to be wasted on crap like this
I don t know what some of you are smoking but i suspect it s potent br br To call Swept Away awful would be an insult to the very concept of terribleness The acting is hideous and i m not picking on Madonna here we all know she s useless but someone should have warned everyone else that her ailment is contagious My back literally hurts from cringing so much at poorly delivered lines The editing is so sloppy it beggars description The photography and composition which in this era competence should be a GIVEN for any film with a budget are astonishingly inept even the lighting is horrid and unnatural looking These are BASIC elements of filmmaking if you can t get them right you should seek another line of work It s as contrived as a grade 3 production of Snow White except nowhere near as well made or interesting br br The original film by Lina Wertmueller is a wonderful satire and metaphor superbly acted and written featuring breathtaking visuals you can practically taste the sea salt and feel the windswept sand in your hair The sexual tension feels real and immediate those of you who found Guy Ritchie s version deplorable should see it it really is one of the landmarks of world cinema br br Those of you who thought the remake is some kind of masterpiece should have your heads examined
It s not my fault My girlfriend made me watch it br br There is nothing positive to say about this film There has been for many years an idea that Madonna could act but she can t There has been an idea for years that Guy Ritchie is a great director but he is only middling An embarrassment all round br br
I had the mis fortune to see this film at a showing in the US Having reluctantly sat through the entire abysmal thing I am shocked to have seen so many good reviews here on IMDB br br The original film was a turkey but an interesting one It fitted into that early seventies post 1969 revolution thing this film just stinks of well nothing really It s that bad br br Imagine a badly done perfume commercial see what I mean br br Madonna never could act and has been an embarrassment on the big screen for years She looks worse and worse with every one of those years increasingly coming to resemble a skinned meerkat br br Guy Ritchie who has built his reputation on Lock Stock could never direct either his movies are shallow badly cut fashion shows He doesn t disappoint here either he wisely cast his wife as the star of this debacle br br Please people take little heed of the good reviews this movie has received from other posters below They are quite obviously business plants br br Don t encourage Ritchie to humiliate himself further by giving him money br br
WARNING SPOILERS CONTAINED HEREIN br br This is a semi autobiographical look at what might happen to Madonna if she were ever to be stranded on a deserted island There s absolutely no challenge to Madonna in this role and it shows She s just Madonna playing Madonna and she can t even get THAT right I know what you re saying you re saying How do you know this is what Madonna is really like you ve never met her Correct I haven t but we all remember Truth or Dare don t we I know Kevin Costner does br br You would think in the year 2002 that Madonna might have learned something one way or the other from the crossover ladies that have also made their way across the silver screen For goodness sake hasn t Madonna seen Glitter Mariah Carey showed the film world HOW IT IS DONE Mariah kicks Madonna s trashy butt to the curb in beauty talent screen presence charisma characterization you name it All we see from this glimpse into Madonna s world is she s the only one in it br br If there s one thing to be said for Madonna it is that she s consistent When she was an MTV darling she set the world of women s fashion back 20 years Now in film she has set women s roles in film AND society back 20 years by glamourizing all the most hated horrible reprehensible odious qualities women have been reputed to have locked away inside them qualities they have been so desperately trying to prove they really don t possess br br HERE S THE SPOILERS DON T READ ANY FURTHER IF YOU DON T WANT TO KNOW br br Here s the one good thing I will say about this film and I really was impressed by it They didn t go for the Hollywood Ending Madonna s character lives In the typical happy Hollywood ending Madonna s character would have died on the island and her long suffering oppressed whipped husband would have been free to finally settle down with a good decent woman a woman who would be the exact opposite of his deceased wife and they both live happily ever after But in this extremely depressing conclusion she is rescued and once more this poor victim of a husband is once again saddled with his demon of a wife and his life will once again become a living hell br br HERE ENDETH THE SPOILERS
May contain spoilers br br I bent over backwards to be fair to this film I knew it starred Madonna I knew it lasted a whole week in theaters I knew it got a lot of bad reviews I wasn t expecting a deep and thoughtful examination of class culture and sexuality like we got in the Italian original The benefit of the doubt lasted a whole ten minutes br br Madonna plays a rich pretentious nit witted Gorgon who goes on vacation with her henpecked husband and flippant friends the brunette woman is as bad as Madonna exhibiting some really dumb facial expressions Adriano Giannini plays the ship s first mate who the Madonna character delights in humiliating and treating like dirt in every scene they have together Why is she such a bitch to him Simply because the plot requires it so that later when the two of them get marooned on a deserted Mediterranean island the tables will be turned and he will teach her a lesson Just as inexplicable is how they fall in love despite having nothing in common and having abused each other for two thirds of the movie br br Swept Away is a silly simplistic superficial movie from beginning to end Madonna gives a typically wooden performance There are many dumb scenes Madonna singing and dancing atrociously at the demand of Giannini a fantasy scene with Madonna and a lot of scenes where he slaps her and kicks her in the butt Guy Ritchie does his stylish editing which is laughable here The film contains some of the worst dialog I ve heard in a major movie in several years The ending is sappy and implausible It s basically The Blue Lagoon meets Overboard minus the nudity of the former and the sense of humor of the latter br br Maybe Madonna s ego is so big that she insists on continuing to prove herself as a competent actress Please give it up Madge for our sake as well as yours This isn t her worst movie though That distinction still belongs to Shanghai Surprise She hasn t made anything worse than that yet
No doubt when Madonna and Guy Ritchie married it was because they both thought it would help their movie careers If you ve been through the ordeal of watching Swept Away then you know at that level it was a match made in hell After nearly 20 years of trying to become a respected actress or octress as she might have pronounced it in The Next Best Thing she still can t get out of herself long enough to turn in a performance that anyone with taste could even call decent And that s the thing that makes people dislike her so much on the screen that gut feeling that her ego is so inflated that it prevents her from being able to just let go and connect with her audience If there s any justice in this universe she just blew her last chance
and forget this Completely If you really need to see Madonna act rent Body of Evidence at least Willem Defoe is in that one br br In this film while the sets are beautiful you may want to mute the dialog You won t miss anything Bruce Greenwood is wasted Jeanne Tripplehorn is a prop and Madonna is so awful it becomes amusing Why they had to butcher the original film into this mess I will never know guess they thought it was bankable Madonna as an actress certainly is NOT br br If you rent the original film from 1979 though you will enjoy it and the actors in it can actually act 1 10
For years Madonna has tried to prove not only herself but the public eye that she can act Unfortunately trying too hard while failing to shed her own persona doesn t mix well br br She seems to fare better when she s NOT the star of any movie if you watch her in supporting performances in DESPERATELY SEEKING SUSAN 1985 or A LEAGUE OF THEIR OWN 1992 she actually comes off looking good Since the story revolves on other actors the weight of the expectation is taken off her shoulders by default br br The trouble starts when she is asked to be the star of a movie regardless the genre Being the focus of a plot that needs to be told in a visual way whether it be good mediocre or plain awful she has to emote in ways that are akin to an actual movie performance as opposed to a video performance This is the crucial difference between Madonna and let s say Bette Davis or Meryl Streep The latter two even if the movie were to fail because the visual storytelling lacked some effectiveness in having us relate to it or because the script fell short or because the actress per se was just not at her moment there would be an extra something in their performances that would elevate the movie from being a complete bomb Both Davis and Streep have had their share Bette having a longer career than Streep in such fare as BUNNY O HARE 1971 and WICKED STEPMOTHER 1989 Streep in SHE DEVIL 1989 But at least there s been that naturalism in the way both attacked their roles that made us forget the banality of the movie and watch the performance br br Madonna on the other hand not being an especially gifted actress capable of really letting us in on her ability to convey a persona other than herself fares much worse and even in the hands of someone as Woody Allen in SHADOWS AND FOG 1992 an inferior classic she in her pat screen time seems stilted and a little stiff maybe even nervous as if she were aware of the cameras and crew and just couldn t let go br br So here she tries yet once again to prove she can act in what is essentially a two character movie Guy Ritchie more known for action movies filled in masculine energy seems as adrift telling a story closer to someone of the likes of Michaelangelo Antonioni or Ingmar Bergman who could tell a tale of two people with incredible ease And at 89 minutes the events which take place happen in such an unconvincing way that when the final half hour comes along and the story takes a dramatic turn it doesn t feel sincere From being an absolute witch with no redeeming values to suddenly being in love this has to be the most unconvincing 180 degree turn since Fay Dunaway s Laura suddenly discovered her passion for Tommy Lee Jones in THE EYES OF LAURA MARS 1978 Equally unconvincing is Adriano Giannini s nasty turn around the middle of the movie it lacks any humor and feels genuinely psychopathic and when he gives in to Madonna s love it s too quick to be believed Filming this in slow music and a visual montage of lovemaking and beautiful scenery doesn t enhance or add upon this transformation from what would have been a story of survival between to unlikeable characters to a love story where both discover each other br br Trying to have an unsatisfying ending works against the movie as well it only makes it drag bog it down and when Madonna has to be filmed going from hope to devastation in a tight close up it feels she s trying too hard Many an actress have done better in conveying so much doing so little Hers is a performance more suited to acting styles of the late 20s early 30s where posturing compensated as acting a part or an emotion br br Could the movie have been better Of course There are a myriad of ways to have filmed it in a way that would leave the viewer feeling that these people could at least hope to see each other again it s been done before in OVERBOARD 1987 for example It could have had an existential undertone in which two very different people have to rely on each other but not necessarily change to ensure a moral tone Much dialog and unnecessary erotic scenes could have been spared for a more silent film look as in PERSONA 1966 It could have even been something of a thriller providing that the Giannini character have a mean streak as Billy Zane had in DEAD CALM 1989 Even if it would have been done as a sex farce it would have worked better for Madonna as the over the top uber control freak getting her comeuppance But with its mean streaked humor without at least a glimpse of her character having a softer side that hides behind a mask of bitchdom and without really defining Giannini s own character this becomes another misfire trying to look like a battle of the sexes
I really wanted to like this movie because the critics have been unkind br br to it to say the least but it was terrible Really terrible Badly br br acted a witless script cack handed direction Watching this film was br br like watching a car crash you want to look away but you keep staring br br because you want to see how messy it s going to get Well the car is br br wrecked and there are no survivors On the plus side the cinematography br br was nice made me want to go on holiday if only to cleanse myself from br br this unholy
I almost saw this at an actual movie theatre an art house theatre no less but couldn t make it there in the one whole week it played but yesterday I finally saw it on cable and well I wasn t disappointed that s for sure Madonna has done it again YET ANOTHER BOMB When will this woman learn When will the studios learn Or perhaps they already have since this film was largely dumped with little fanfare and deadly word of mouth One would hope that being directed by her talented husband who s created some interesting and or terribly entertaining work would bring out the same quality Madonna showed in Desperately Seeking Susan alas it just isn t meant to be for here she is at her very worst singularly convinced of her own greatness the smugness permeating every frame she s in made all the more unbearable by her wavering faux British accent an accent that only underscores the fact that her speaking voice is immature in quality and not especially pleasant This may sound unnecessarily cruel but LISTEN to the woman and LOOK at her films of say the past decade like a latter day Bette Davis there is an unmistakable brittleness to not only her carriage but to her very face and body which here despite the warm photography displayed throughout the film perhaps its only saving grace are done no favors To her credit the entire affair is so misbegotten that one wonders if the world s greatest actress on her best day could do anything with this mess No one involved escapes unharmed Bruce Greenwood actually seems pained to be on screen though poor Jeanne Tripplehorn seems to carry herself as if she s actually in something good which had me thinking all the while Denial ain t just a river in Egypt Adriano Giannini son of Giancarlo Giannini star of the Italian original Swept Away is like his father before him immensely attractive and isn t altogether bad despite winning a Razzie nomination for Worst Actor but like almost everything else about this production it all comes back to Madonna on whose shoulders rest the blame Why her Why not her husband director Guy Ritchie Just who do YOU think was behind this remake What actress wouldn t want nearly every shot of a movie to be centered on her with only a relative nobody sharing the screen Oh sure Ritchie deserves some blame surely he or someone ANYONE should have and could have taken his lead aside and insisted on something bordering on ACTUAL FEELING in her line readings for her performance is so wooden it s a surprise the rest of the cast didn t get splinters or at least display a semblance of warmth but she seems resistant to be anything but a cinematic black hole Above and beyond anything else this is strictly a vanity project for its star so she is ultimately accountable for it A film like this an Odd Couple ish war of the classes should be light and fun with leads who can bounce off one another with witty even romantic dialogue for what else can a film whose plot involves two disparate people stranded really be Honestly I don t think anyone involved knew exactly the tone they were trying for it succeeds neither as comedy I defy you to laugh even once or romance Madonna s ice princess routine precludes ANY chemistry It s not even bad enough for us bad movie lovers to enjoy A real shame
This is absolutely the dumbest movie I ve ever seen What a waste of a splendid cast That s James Cromwell as the ignoramus playing deputy I could go on and on but I would obviously be spending more time on this review than anybody ever did on the script The only thing this movie is about is us vs them and how to revel in profane slapstick beyond any reasonable human being s tolerance This is one of the 10 worst movies I have ever seen and I LOVE James Garner
i didn t enjoy this movie at all for one i just found it crude and vulgar for no reason i also felt it s misogynistic against women also the movie really doesn t appear to be about anything and i didn t find any of the characters likable really the there doesn t seem to be any point to it all maybe i m missing something but for me this movie is pretty much a waste of time when i could have been doing something more productive and enjoyable like using my face as a pin cushion James garner is in this thing as are C Thomas Howell and Shirley Jones and James Cromwell all are wasted here and i m sure this was a low point in each of their respective careers Jennilee Harrison from the later years of Three s Company is also in the movie and it is nice to see her in a non ditsy role but other than that she can t rise above the mediocre script for me Tank is a 3 10
This movie is truly one of the worst pieces of garbage ever It really is surprising that something so completely terrible could be made But if you can stand the mind numbing plot character development and direction you may get a kick out of the soundtrack which is so appalling that it is funny The movie begins terribly and quickly becomes unwatchable Someone should give anyone involved with this movie some sort of consolation because their career was probably ruined because of involvement in this movie If you do end up seeing this movie or have seen it already I feel your pain then these words have come too late For anyone else Stay away at all costs or realize that the movie is so bad that it will waste 2 hours of your life Then at least you can clean up or something while viewing it
First off the title character is not even the main character of the movie He is the sidekick of the cult leader The actor who portrays Igor believed that screaming loud laughing hysterically and having a crooked smile while bugging out your eyes would be an excellent way to scare people Igor also had the annoying habit of yelling because he never actually just spoke in a high pitched voice He would also say idiotic one liners For example when the cult leader murders one of his followers with a buzz saw Igor upon seeing this yells out Paul No Paul Why d you do it I could have cut her clean So clean In another scene Igor tells a victim that she would have to get her own tools for surgery because right now it was his time to operate Aside from the bad acting the ending did not make sense because while the story builds up what little steam it has towards the climax which is Igor getting a crossbow arrow to the head and the rest of his lunatic buddies being killed he shows up again two more times to kill the remaining good guys The movie offers no explanation of this only telling the viewer that Igor escaped from the mental hospital What Bottom line is do not waste your time watching this movie I wish I could get back the moments I lost watching this
Igor and the Lunatics is a totally inept and amateurish attempt at a crazy hippie cult killing spree horror movie Apparently even nearly twenty years later Charles Manson was still inspiring overenthusiastic but incompetent trash filmmakers This is a typical Troma production meaning in other words there s a lot of boring and totally irrelevant padding footage to accompany the nonsensical plot There s a bit of random gore and gratuitous nudity on display which isn t bad but it s all so very pointless and ugly that it becomes frustrating to look at Igor and the Lunatics is so desperate that it s even using a lot of the footage twice like the circle saw killing for example The incoherent plot tries to tell the story of a hippie cult run by the drug addicted and Charlie Manson wannabe Paul One of Paul s lower ranked disciples named Igor becomes a little bit too obsessed with the Bible stories and drug orgies and gradually causes the entire cult to descent further into criminal insanity Just to illustrate through a little example exactly how crazy Igor is he tears the heart straight out of the chest of a really sexy black hitch hiker girl There s an annoying synthesizer soundtrack and some truly embarrassingly lame pseudo artistic camera tricks like slow motion footage and lurid dream sequences Maybe there s one sequence that more or less qualifies as worthwhile for trash fanatics and that is when a poor girl is cut in half with a machete For no particular reason the camera holds the shot of the blade in the bloodied stomach for fifteen whole seconds
Pretty incoherent movie about a man who belonged to and left a 1960s superficially hippie religious cult who fights them sixteen years later The man has a child with one of the other cultists who during a raid by the police is hidden away and taken by another man named Hawk who lives in a small cabin by the river The cult kills some of its followers or some of the people in town It s hard to keep track of who characters are or what time period the scenes are supposed to be taking place The leader gets paroled sixteen years later I got that from the box I missed the amount of time in the movie Nobody is made to look any older not noticeably anyway br br One murder is done with a large circular logging saw others are done with knives or a crossbow I never heard the title character s name mentioned in the movie but he s the one who overacts the most hooting and hollering br br The movie is patched together pretty poorly with voice over helping not much to explain what is going on Some of the sound effects were pretty bad A man is getting punched and we hear the sound of a whip cracking A woman fires a gun and we don t hear it fire but hear a ricochet instead It doesn t seem to have been done for comical effect
Simply terrible Why wouldn t you use actual actors Look this has to stop Stop using non actors If you want any credibility or any message sent via these low budget films please for the love of god use real actors Most will work for free take advantage of that Now back to my comment anyway the humour was lower than that of the bathroom variety and wasn t funny on any level As for the quality in one scene filmed on a public transportation bus you could see the reflection of the crew guess what It was one guy with what looked like a Sony Camcorder and probably not even his Well I assume the only audience for this film are people with a gore fetish and it wasn t even good gore
I enjoyed the previous Ittenbach movie that I d seen Burning Moon But while that movie was rather grim and nasty Premutos seems to mostly play it for laughs While its admirable how Ittenbach made this movie with no money in his spare time and the DVD documentary is worthwhile to see this I found myself constantly battling not to fast forward to the next gore scene Sure there s gore and if that s all you want then go ahead and enjoy But be warned there s an inordinate amount of lame comedy and tedious story exposition Many are comparing this to Peter Jackson s movies especially Braindead But looking at what Jackson did on a similar budget in Bad Taste it s clear Ittenbach is lacking one thing that Jackson has talent 3 10 for pretty good and plentiful gore effects and for getting the most out of limited resources but not worth the money I paid for it
br br The movie starts out as an ordinary comic hero movie It s about the boy who is picked on has no parents and is madly in love with the schools 1 girl Nothing surprises in the movie there is nothing that you can t guess coming in the movie Toby Mcguire shows us that either he is no good actor or that no actor in the world can save a script like this one Maybe kids around the age of ten can enjoy the film but it is a bit violent for the youngest You can t get away from thinking of movies like X men Batman and Spawn All of those titles are better I almost walked out the last 20 minutes One thing that could have been good though was the computeranimation BUT not even that is anything to put in the christmas tree So my recomendation Don t see this film even if you get paid for it
Whoever wrote the nice post about this must have been a friend of these guys This is bad even for backyard wrestling In fact this isn t even backyard wrestling really it s a few guys hitting each other on a trampoline Each guys is about 45 lbs wet and there is not one ounce of entertainment value in this It is just a few bored kids that even give yard tards a bad name if that is possible If you want to see some entertaining backyard wrestling pick up Backyard Wrestling A Pleasure for Pain It stars the 2 biggest names in BYW MDogg20 and Josh Prohibition These guys are good They have actually went since yarding it and gotten professionally trained as real pro wrestlers They went legit and have gotten better I recommend checking out those 2 guys MDogg is insane and off the hook So don t waste your time or your cash on this crappy DVD there are better back yard videos out there
Yeah unfortunately I came across the DVD of this and found that it was incredibly awful br br First of all the characters suck I mean come on if some dork in an orange hat who calls himself Orange Sherbert is the best creative idea these guys could come up for a character then they should definitely not be in the film making scene Poor costumes bad interviews and basically there is not one wrestler on this whole disc with any shred of charisma br br The wrestling in Splatter Rampage Wrestling is nothing more than these idiots gently and playfully bouncing together on a trampoline They make sure to giggle together all the while too making the experience seem more like a toddler s playtime than a wrestling deathmatch br br Basically Splatter Rampage Wrestling is a pretty lackluster Backyard Wrestling clone Only instead of blood weapons mayhem and WRESTLING we get a trampoline giggling kids TERRIBLE audio and some guy called Orange Sherbert br br Wrestling fan or not avoid this DVD It s awful
In the last 10 years I have worked in 3 different indie professional wrestling organizations managed many pro wrestlers including 2 Backyard Wrestling stars worked on 2 different wrestling TV programs and did voice overs and commentary for many wrestling DVD s I have NEVER witnessed the level of outright amateurish stupidity lack of talent and skill and shoddy production quality found in Splatter Rampage Wrestling To even list this as a wrestling video of ANY kind is an outright misuse of the term Shot with low dollar video cameras it s essentially home videos of kids play fighting in back yards The sound quality is bad the video quality is bad and the acting is horrendous The wrestlers wear makeshift costumes with hand drawn tee shirts and ski masks and hit each other with a variety of items and halfway imitate wrestling moves Sometimes the matches are on the grass Sometimes on a back yard trampoline ALL are poorly acted and executed with a shameless lack of any wrestling skill In short don t bother with this stinker Whether your interest in this DVD is entertainment or academic both in my case you will be terribly disappointed
The plot is so manipulative counting completely on the most uncredible and unthinkable decisions of the adults in each and every parenting decision The children are super as far as charm and delivery of the lines but as I say the whole plot depends on each and every adult being complete idiots and therefore in THAT case making more sense out of their actions and at the same time being the only way to explain the boys actions of total mistrust Why would sweey charming little boys take a baby from the shore How did the baby get to the shore and at the same time account for it being the LAST place to be searched Why would the 2 boys NEVER be informed an instead at the same time a baby is missing nobody gives a fig about them running around with food and diapers with all that commotion going on and literally every other place it searched There is just no possible justification to ask the audience to believe this Asking to believe it would then do to trial even the informal setting is too insulting to bare
I rented this movie the other night because neither my girlfriend or myself had ever seen it even though we had heard from a mutual friend how great it was br br Now I am pretty conservative in my views but I knew going in it would be pretty liberal given who directed it I figured before the movie started Michael Douglas would play a compassionate popular liberal beloved by the masses and there would be a stodgy conservative opponent as his antagonist But I thought thats where the political statement would begin and end br br OK the plot was solid Single president falls for a lobbyist OK this has potential I thought to be pretty entertaining since the plot was unique But then the movie turned into a liberal infomercial The movie became more about gun control and environmental issues than it did about the relationship between the President and Sydney Annette Bening br br There were several ridiculous premises in this movie 1 The character Sydney playing this six figure lobbyist who is a closer Could she have been more flighty She was constantly disorganized and seemed in awe of everything Hardly a closer I am an sales and she could not close selling a glass of water to a man dying of thirst br br 2 Secondly is there anything more ridiculous than Richard Dreyfuss playing a right wing fanatic This is the most liberal man in Hollywood and her is playing some right wing ideologue Give me a break I liked how he took his conservative character and made him as sinister as possible br br 3 The speech at the end was simply ludicrous The line about I am a proud card carrying member of the ACLU was a joke First no president would ever admit something like that being an active member of an ultra fringe group Second why even bring something like that up You just alienated off over half the movie going audience who is moderate or conservative br br I thought the plot was great and unique I thought Michael Douglas was a good choice as president But the movie went from being a movie to a left wing political statement which is why the movie failed br br Its a shame to see a great plot ruined by Hollywood having to force their political views on the audience
If derivative and predictable rape revenge thrillers are your thing then you re in for a rare treat They don t really appeal to me so I couldn t find any single thing to redeem this peculiar tale It seems like something straight out of the 1980s a different age when this would have gone straight to video Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer do OK work with a weak script and a tedious scenario But what is Gillian Anderson doing getting involved with a film like this after the brilliance of her performance as Lady Deadlock in the BBC TV adaptation of Bleak House last year The director is said to have been influenced by witnessing a near rape and by his work on documentaries but even that s not an excuse for the bizarre scene where a pack of rural hounds beat up Dyer I don t think I was the only person in the cinema laughing What I can t understand is the involvement of the companies behind this film FilmFour and Verve Pictures Both have been involved in some great independent British films in recent years Verve distributed Bullet Boy Code 46 and Red Road Straightheads doesn t deserve to be mentioned in the same breath FilmFour and Verve take note is this really the best you can do What are independent British filmmakers going to make of your artistic judgement It s a big blot on both of your reputations Listen carefully can you hear the thousands of fans of independent British films crying in despair
WARNING Contains MANY SPOILERS br br Let me start by saying I have a huge respect for Gillian Anderson s incredible talent as a varied and versatile actress which is why I cannot comprehend her reasons for agreeing to make this film once she saw the script or lack thereof br br The premise of the film was in my opinion a great idea and there were some genuinely thought provoking themes in there but it ended up like a collapsed soufflé It exemplifies why I hate 99 of British cinema It feels too long it s tedious for the most part and not a lot happens after the first twenty minutes Just when you think there s a chance of it picking up some speed it disappoints like Paula Radcliffe running a marathon With little imaginative directing and a minimalist plot there isn t much to keep the audience from nodding off into their popcorn As for the script I can only surmise that the writer was trying to save a few trees with the average scene reading something along the lines of Alice F OFF Adam stares Adam runs off into woods Alice follows Alice ADAM ADAM I suspect that word for word the actors probably got paid more than Kate Moss did for her Virgin Mobile adverts What few lines there were didn t have a lot of variation with a frequent use of the f word that would make Bridget Jones s friend Shazza proud There is little establishment of the main characters before the main sordid event which leaves the audience lacking much sympathy for the characters beyond an automatic Oh that s terrible reaction br br Alice isn t the kind of woman who courts sympathy either She s got a great job an expensive London apartment with roof space to die for yet she comes across on screen as conceited bitter and dissatisfied before her life takes a turn for the worst After the attack a few layers are peeled back which sort of explain why she is this way to start with she grew up with a tough as old boots soldier who thought that teaching her how to shoot his gun was the ultimate expression of love so instead of following in his footsteps she ran away to the big city in search of something to make her feel like her life is worth living Instead she found a group of stereotypical middle class Toffs who look down on anyone not rich enough to drive a Lexus and the luxuries that come with an integrated security entertainment system i e becoming Mrs Robinson to a wanna be Cockney wide boy electrician Someone pass me a tissue The one saving grace of this character is that she is played by Gillian Anderson In the hands of a lesser actress she would ve been intolerably one dimensional but Ms Anderson actually manages to inject a few fleeting moments of humanity into this otherwise lifeless human being most notably when she s sincerely apologising for her road rage in a vain attempt to stop her attackers from continuing their assault br br I can t say that Adam fared much better either Danny Dyer played him well as a fish out of water Jack the Lad but a good performance couldn t save him from both the lack of a script and the total absence of any character background br br This film relied mostly on shock value but the timing was off and it felt far too engineered from beginning to end As for the shock the most shocking thing about this film is the unashamed demonstration of how painfully thin Ms Anderson has become it was almost as unsettling to see as the brutal attack scenes On a side note only in a British film would a gang of violent sex attackers take the time to offer each other contraception before continuing to cheer their mates on talk about stiff upper lip taken to the extreme If this is the kind of film that the National Lottery is donating money to make then I m not surprised that fewer and fewer people are choosing to spend their pound each week br br Saying that I hated this film is giving it too much credit I didn t care enough about any of the characters to warrant that strong an emotion I want that one and a bit hours of my life back please
Gillian Anderson is an arrogant driven career woman who picks up working class oik Danny Dyer for a night of fun After a stupid accident in the countryside they are brutally attacked After recovering and after a chance meeting with one of the attackers their thoughts turn to that of revenge br br I thought Straightheads was terrible Violent brutal misogynistic and unpleasant If I didn t dislike the phrase a great deal I would call Straightheads a video nasty Certainly it was the kind of film that would have had a no budget release straight to video during the dark days of the 1980 s Frankly I don t know how Straightheads got a cinema release br br I am not a prude I don t mind sex and violence in the movies but they have to be married to a movie with a a good plot or b good characterisation or c preferably both Straightheads had neither No progression in the plot or the characters and too much left unexplained and unsaid Luckily Straightheads went nowhere fast It was only 80 minutes long br br It was a shame because there was the germ of an interesting film here with an especially interesting turn in the plot in the last third How often do I say this but it could have been good if it had been done properly What a shame I really like Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer but they were on a hiding to nothing with this film She especially is very underrated and is still particularly fit br br If you want to see a good British revenge movie rent or buy Shane Meadows Dead Man s Shoes It is a little masterpiece Last weekend I should have seen his This Is England instead Ce sera sera
Well where to start here Straightheads presents me with a bit of a dilemma Had this film come out of Italy in say 1975 been directed by Ruggero Deodatto and starred David Hess then I d be lapping it up faster than Labrador drinks water on a summer s day Because whilst Tarantino and Rodriguez are busy elsewhere with their homage to grindhouse cinema Dan Reed has produced a rape revenge grindhouse picture of his very own in England and on seemingly the same budget as it would have taken Rodriguez to turn Rose McGowan s leg into a machine gun Because if you want to play grindhouse bingo then let me call out the numbers br br 1 Rich high flying career woman meets a bit of rough from the wrong side of the tracks in an implausible manner and equally implausibly gets the hots for him Check br br 2 Gratuitous shots of said high flying career woman in various states of nudity Check br br 3 Convoluted and highly unlikely plot development that sets up characters that exist solely to do what they do and who cannot be imagined to have any existence outside the scenes they are in Check br br 4 Unnecessarily graphic rape scene perpetrated by a gang of males with no discernible depth of personality or background other than they are there to rape Check br br 5 Gritty and bloody scenes of murder and revenge to round it all off Bingo br br Plotwise Straightheads is pretty basic stuff Dyer meets Anderson and she invites him to a party at a country pile owned by her boss On the way home they upset three locals in a Landover who take their revenge by giving Dyer a good shoeing and gang raping Anderson The couple then set about getting their revenge So far so Straw Dogs Late Night Trains House on the Edge of the Park I Spit On Your Grave etc etc So why didn t I think much of this film A number of reasons I suppose first off having the likes of Gillian Anderson in the cast prima facie lead me to expect better but it s the complete lack of honesty here than rankles most br br Because whenever anyone sits down to watch Hess and his ilk terrorising women and murdering their menfolk in those period pieces from the 70 s then they always know exactly what they are getting low budget quickies designed solely to shock and appeal to the lowest common denominator The baddies terrorise and murder the goodies the goodies turn the tables on the baddies and kill them back and everyone goes home satisfied their desires to see a bit of nasty violence slaked and safe in the knowledge that the world order had been restored br br As writer and director however Dan Reed clearly believes Straightheads has far more to say on the state of the human psyche than that and desperately tries to imbibe his film with a philosophical depth that is simply not there For instance when Anderson and Dyer are planning revenge on their attackers they learn that one of the rapists has a fourteen year old daughter who is an object of lust for the two men he hangs around with When Anderson finally meets him face to face he confesses that he only raped her as a distraction so that his two mates would take their attention away from his daughter The casual and audacious way that Reed drops this little revelation into the plot is simply jaw dropping it s almost as if he expects this simple reference to paedophilia to be enough to throw the audience s moral compass into overdrive and make them leave the cinema thinking they ve just sat through something of significance To make sure we get it at this point we are shown a run through of the rape sequence for a second time ostensibly from the view of the attacker and his concern for his daughter but Reed ensures that we get plenty more shots of Anderson rough handled and raped across the bonnet of her car Gratuitous does not enter into it br br After being told his reasons for raping her Anderson ties him over a table rams the business end of a sniper rifle complete with bulky silencer just in case anyone wasn t clear on the phallic imagery up his jacksie but lacks the courage to pull the trigger telling Dyer who has no such moral qualms that it s over Dyer argues otherwise and their moral dilemma is presented as something that Wittgenstein and Russell may have discussed in their rooms back at Cambridge over tea and cakes It is almost unwatchable in its ludicrousness br br In fairness Ms Anderson acts her guts out throughout the film It s obvious she wants to leave Scully far behind and bless her she certainly does that one wonders what Mulder would have made of his erstwhile partner squatting down to take a leak at the side of the road and then sodomising a man with a gun Dyer on the other hand does what he s done in virtually every film he s made to date that is plays a gor blimey guv cockney type chappie with a roguish grin a cheeky line of patter and a face that most people would never get tired of punching This is particularly true at the closing scene where after murdering his assailants in cold blood Dyer gazes at the camera in what I m sure is meant to be a look of existential anguish that invites us to sympathise at the hand fate has dealt him and the moral quandaries he has had to overcome but instead is far more reminiscent of Oliver Hardy looking exasperatedly at the camera after Stan has landed him in yet another fine mess Which incidentally sums up this film quite nicely
I d been following this films progress for quite some time so perhaps expected a little too much I consider both Gillian Anderson and Danny Dyer to be good at what they do and was interested to see what Dan Reed could come up with but unfortunately it just didn t work for me br br The problem lies in the fact that the film doesn t really seem to understand which genre it s falling into and as such it fails to impress on drama horror and thriller elements because rather than focusing on one of them and doing it well it s a bit of a jack of all trades and master of none br br The premise as with most revenge films is simple couple meet and go out something bad happens and they get their revenge it s a simple formula and one that many directors have handled expertly over the years Unfotunately in this case it s as if Dan Reed thought It d be great to do one of those revenge films that goes a little deeper by showing a more human side to all the characters and delving into their mental state in more detail Wrong There are also a few key elements missing in this type of movie there s generally some kind of warning A don t do this or this might happen element which adds to the tension but there s nothing of the sort here It just simply happens then nothing happens for an hour then something interesting happens and then it ends br br There s a lot of really stiff competition in this genre and hats of to Dan Reed for trying I have no issue with his directing abilities but in term of writing I d say next time he should stick to the formula for the type of film he s making instead of trying to be too clever and he ll have a quality movie on his hands
A truly horrible film that left me feeling sullied by having watched the forty minutes or so I could stand Not the actors fault but the writer director producers financiers etc need a very stiff talking to Maybe it thinks it is profound It isn t This rape and ultra violence unlike that central to Clockwork Orange has nothing to say about or add to the sum of human understanding It s no Straw Dogs either to which I have seen it compared Rather it feels like something Pete Walker might have turned his hand to yet even in saying that I m probably being a bit unfair on Pete Walker br br Revenge is a powerful human desire but The Bedroom Window has more to say about that and male emasculation than this pitiful effort br br I don t think it s particularly misogynistic merely too gleeful in its depiction of certain details the blood running down GA s leg post rape par example It s neither challenging nor confrontational though I m sure the film makers consider themselves very daring just deeply unpleasant br br Is this as high as we can aim Is this why those involved wanted to make films I did write in here the Latin phrase which translates as Oh the Times Oh the customs But the new spell check on IMDb wouldn t let me post until I had removed it Likewise I had to remove square parentheses Get it sorted IMDb br br Where is the lofty aspiration The noble impulse When you look at British film the joyful comedies of Ealing or the Boulting Brothers Carol Reed s work with Graham Greene on Fallen Idol Our Man in Havana or the sublime The Third Man a film which has far more to say about evil than a thousand Straightheads the work of Powell Pressburger or if you want to talk about sex violence and male emasculation look at The Offence Dir Sidney Lumet from an original play by John Hopkins check out Tunes of Glory for something worth making that has something to say br br Unlike the foregoing Straightheads is alas an altogether hateful waste of celluloid
This is the biggest load of crap that I have seen in a long time The last time I hated a movie so much was whilst watching 28 Days later and Magnolia There is absolutely no point to this movie except to see some really sick and twisted sex rape scenes Gillian Anderson relieving herself on the side of the road and every single sentence of dialog having to use the F word at least a couple of times in it It has extremely cheap acting and is very low budget My friend and I eventually turned off the movie after about half an hour We had tried to give it a chance but nothing could save this crud DO NOT WATCH IT
This reminded me SOO much of Michael Winner s crappy Dirty Weekend with it s awful English low budget feel br br Firstly I must say I am a fan of both exploitation and serious film I appreciate say Demented for it s ineptitude and Last House on the Left for it s sheer unashamed brutality And any number of inventive and increasingly brutal Italian spin offs br br This was just pointless though Kind of like a British budget director thought let s remake I Spit on your Grave without making it too harrowing now that horror is back in fashion with Hostel br br The whole thing just doesn t hang together or have a point What s with the rapists s daughter Why bother having the man be an expert in security cameras Crappy
This movie is the worst I ve seen in the last 5 years It is surprising how brilliant actors like two main characters in this movie has accepted to act in such worthless peace of trash The film is rape beating and revenge genre Couple has gone to party and on the way back they hit a deer and he went out to finish it when a jeep full of bad guys comes He didn t go to their car instead he has been kicked and well beaten while she tries to run the car engine which betray her and she has been gang raped Then somehow she is in her fathers house and one of bad guys is her neighbor so she took shotgun and wanted to kill him So stupid scenario Bellow Hollywood He was against that revenge but She is raped They laugh to her so she must kill them all But once inside the house she was satisfied by pushing rifle s top in bad guys anus and went away while he has gone crazy and execute bad guy Personally I think that director run out of money before finishing this because movie ends before they execute anyone else involved in this gang rape and beating which is not big surprise because sponsor obviously has seen this and wanted to take back his money LoL This movie is not even for people who enjoy watching rape because they won t see anything they are looking for This director should be banned It is for upsetting that this peace of trash has been made by British cinematography which I personally like and that is the reason I ve watched this Don t do it yourself you have better things to do that watching stupid scenario film
An unpleasant woman and an equally unpleasant man are violently and horribly assaulted by a group of two dimensional psycho thugs during a night time encounter on a forest road in Shropshire England The man and woman who were assaulted plan and carry out a revenge attack on their attackers br br Utterly repellent piece of voyeuristic trash somehow masquerading as thought provoking drama whilst actually coming across as sub Michael Winner cr p you just know that Oliver Reed and Susan George would have been cast had it so easily have been made in the 1970s What happens to Alice Gillian Anderson and Adam Danny Dyer is appalling and devastating yet Dan Reed somehow manages to rub the viewer s nose in every last glob of its sexual nastiness His camera lingers hungrily on Anderson s naked body both during and after the assault whilst the script leaves almost all the characters floundering in a turgid sea of two dimensional cliché His script forces his characters to behave in such a way as to alienate the viewer further from the victims by shoving more ghastly situations into their faces Adams s attempted post incident assaults on both Sophie and Alice Alice s assault on Heffer AFTER his suicide attempt confession br br The quandary comes from the central protagonists performances Dyer is a horrible actor incapable of light and shade as the young male victim of the initial assault he ll end up in Eastenders mark my words but Anderson is extraordinary Even as the atrocious script forces her character to behave in depraved and ludicrous ways she somehow delivers an extraordinarily compelling and complicated characterisation as a self indulgent arrogant hedonist who encounters such horrors and needs to retaliate br br A vile and pointless film then almost but not quite rescued by a compelling central female performance
Although I use this site quite frequently to see how other people rated what I think are challenging or just plain enjoyable films after watching this movie on Film Four last night I felt compelled to write something down even if it just helps cleanse me once again br br The film was possibly the shallowest experience I ve ever had the main characters played by Danny Dyer 23 You sure and Gillian Anderson who will always be Scully as Leonard Nimoy will always be Spock had no real substance about them I m not sure if the first half hour of the film didn t make the final cut but surely in a revenge movie you would like some empathy with the victims here I couldn t care less In fact the only character I did seem to care about was the dog with the stag coming a close second And both animals out acted Dire sic and Scully who were quite frankly terrible I guess though you re only as good as the script you are given and I d like to warmly thank the writers the producers the director and all of the cast for wasting 90 minutes of my life and some perfectly good electricity
I was really looking forward to watching this being that I love Danny Dyer and I think Gillian Anderson is a gifted actress The beginning was interesting I liked the relationship between the two stars It then quickly jumps to the main plot which is they get attacked by a group of strangers and Dyer gets beaten extremely bad while Anderson gets raped They then decide to go for some revenge Sounds good right Well it s not The story gets boring and side tracked and certain things get really weird I won t give out any details but things happen that I for one have no desire to see I like to give all movies the benefit of the doubt and I really wanted to like this one It just didn t work out I give it a 3 out of 10 mainly for the acting
This UK psychological thriller is known in the United States as CLOSURE Exploitation of X Files Gillian Anderson who plays an attractive middle aged businesswoman of substance named Alice She must attend a business party and invites Adam Danny Dyer who just installed a security system for her to be her escort On the way home speeding through the woods on a narrow lane Alice s auto collides with a deer After pulling the wounded animal off the road the couple is savagely attacked by a drunken gang of thugs Adam is beat to a pulp Alice is gang raped and both are emotionally and physically devastated by the ruthless attack When the identities of their attackers are discovered Alice and Adam set out to exact revenge brutal revenge The couple at times find themselves at odds on how to deal with the ruthless attackers Their final decision is to avenge with no mercy Let there be no mistake payback IS hell Also in the cast Anthony Calf Ralph Brown Francesca Fowler and Antony Byrne Brutal violence disturbing images nudity and graphic rape
Unless I m sadly mistaken I rented A Nightmare on Elm Street 3 several years ago and there was a music video I m pretty sure which was called Dream Warriors at the end of it and I rented this one on DVD hoping that the video would be there because it was one of the funniest things I ve ever seen It s amazing how stuff from the 80s is so funny now but nothing is funnier than 80s rap videos There was this rap group singing that song Dream Warriors on the VHS version of this movie after the credits and they re all wearing like denim jackets with no shirt underneath and form fitting jean shorts that are all frayed at the bottoms like Daisy Dukes What could make a rap group look more foolish I can t imagine br br spoilers At any rate I was disappointed in looking for that video on the DVD version so all I had was this mediocre installment in the Freddy Krueger series The movie sort of starts off with the same idea as part 2 with the main character witnessing all kinds of gruesome murders and then sort of coming out of a trance and finding himself with the bloody hands Kristen Parker Patricia Arquette has a nightmare about the infamous house that Nancy Thompson used to live in then runs to the bathroom the sink s handles turn into Freddy s hands and attack her and then she wakes up standing in her bathroom having slit her own wrists From there the movie turns into the usual mental hospital installment br br Larry Fishburne tired of always playing the bad guy in his roles was happy to take on the role in this film as a nice guy orderly stern but accommodating when the patients want to bend the rules a little Not surprisingly he turns in what is by leaps and bounds the best performance in the movie Arquette later goes on to become an accomplished actor but had not perfected her acting skills when she starred in this film The characters in the movie are mostly all patients at the mental hospital that Kristen is placed into after cutting her wrists All of them are cynical and uncooperative almost none believing that they really belong there at all Eventually they realize and are able to convince the staff that they are all having dreams about the same man and it s not just some kind of group hysteria br br Heather Langenkamp has returned in her famous role as Nancy Thompson this time grown up into a dream researcher as a result of her childhood experiences involving Freddy Krueger Not surprisingly she is able to quickly relate to the hysterical Kristen and the rest of the patients since she had experienced exactly what they re going through There are some interesting murders in this installment and the technology used for the special effects have taken a huge jump There is a gigantic worm like Freddy that tries to swallow Kristen whole there is a scene where a television turns into Freddy and with mechanical arms he picks up one of the patients there for some late night entertainment and punishes her for sitting too close to the TV but there is also an unconvincing go motion scene where a couple guys have a fight with Freddy Krueger s skeleton which has been rotting in the trunk of some car in a car junkyard And one of the more groan inducing scenes was one where Freddy attacks one of the patients in his dream the one famous for sleepwalking tearing the muscles and tendons out of his arms and legs and leading him around like a puppet Ouch br br We get a peek into Freddy s past in this installment Not only do we meet his mother but we also find out the circumstances that led to Freddy being fathered by more than 100 maniacs In fighting Freddy the patients all band together and in their dreams use their special powers most of which reflect their shortcomings in real life to fight him One student bound to a wheelchair is able to walk in his dreams another has the hilarious powers of what he calls the Wizard Master another is beautiful and bad she has lots of makeup her hair stands up in a foot high Mohawk and she has knives Clever but the movie falters when it has only one of the patients the one who can t speak not have any powers in his dreams until the climax of the movie when he suddenly realizes that he can talk in his dreams at just the right moment to save the day His dream power was a little too obvious to have been left out for that long but collectively now you see why the movie was subtitled Dream Warriors br br Altogether this is not an entirely weak entry into the series The acting is pretty shoddy but it s actually pretty good for a horror movie Larry Fishburne vastly overshadows the rest of the cast displaying wonderful acting skills early on in his career and the movie is not simply a rehash of either of the first two a problem that plagues the Friday the 13th movies much more than the Elm Street films The characters are never developed enough to allow for the later creation of much tension which is why most of the deaths come across more as creative ways to kill off someone in a horror film than the tragic loss of the life of one of the characters that we ve come to know and root for their triumph over evil But then again not a lot of horror movies take the time to really develop their characters to the point where you throw up your hands in defeat when they are killed or are on the edge of your seat as they run for their lives But it s important to note that the few horror films that actually do that are almost invariably the best ones
what kind of sh t is this Power rangers vs Freddy It was watchable and as good as the first film in the beginning but from the part where the protagonists get super powers in theirs dreams it started to become childish This sh t should have been rated PG or PG 13 rather than R I expected to see some very mature stuff but it was only for the 1 3 of the film The rest are for little kids Plus it s focused too much on Christianity I know Freddy s a demon but there are many religions that have different ways to fight demons Why does it always have to be Christianity This is total Orientalism and filled with white men westerner s superiority Don t watch this show it to little kids who loves power rangers
Jeez only in the 70 s Antonio Margheriti brings us this quirky hybrid of spaghetti western and kung fu flick evolving around a treasure hunt The spices of this trashy co production between Shaw Brothers and an Italian one off company include humorous storytelling off the wall happenings and some very tame T A Extra campy moments are being served by Lee Van Cleef s obnoxious wig leather clad bible thumping psycho gunman Yancey Hobbitt loveably hammed up by Julian Ugarte the man who should ve done way more obscure European genre productions than he did wanna be witty dialogue hilarious background music and completely laughable sound effects accompanying various little events especially every jump made by Lo Lieh br br While this little piece of action falls fare and square into the Turkey Territory it s great to see Van Cleef and Lo Lieh on the same screen and you can t deny the charisma of this duo Don t expect too much and you ll get plenty out of it br br This is my truth What is yours
Although there were some amusing moments I thought the movie was pretty lame The longer it ran the worse it got Once the action entered Monument Valley I found myself watching the magnificent outcroppings more than the increasingly silly and unconvincing interaction of the characters br br The character of the daughter was particularly incoherent First she s in on the deal then discovers the truth and she bails Then she s back again then deserts them again Then she s back again There s no apparent motivation for any of her decisions There were interesting characters some interesting scenes and many missed possibilities I would have to say the pictures was much less than the sum of its parts Apparently the people who liked Repo Man were inclined to like this one Searchers 2 0 is no match for The Searchers
I knew I was going to see a low budget movie but I expected much more from an Alex Cox film The acting by the two leading men was terrible especially the white guy The girl should have won an Oscar compared to those two This movie was filled with what I guess would be inside jokes for film industry people and a few other jokes that I actually understood and made me laugh out loud which is rare Without these laugh out loud moments I would have given this film 2 10 What happened to the Alex Cox who made all the 80s classics br br SPOILER br br There were a couple of questions I had after the movie was over Why did the Mexican guy go to the other guy s house at the beginning What did his daughter say he got 100 people fired from his last job Why was she breaking her own stuff when she was mad at him I guess I should have gone to the Q A after the movie but I didn t want to get up at 10am
Seriously there is absolutely NOTHING good about this crap fest at all Randolph Scott a closet homosexual who lived with his lover Cary Grant for twelve years is at his most wooden and boring in the least role At 57 he was clearly far too old for these romantic roles although it doesn t matter so much here because Gail Russell looks so much older than her 31 years and she is so ugly due to her chronic alcoholism and chain smoking Lee Marvin plays his usual villainous role but it isn t enough to save this garbage Thank God they don t make westerns any more they re just dated racist old movies that glamorise guns and murder br br 0 10
I wondered why I didn t like Peggy Sue Got Married more than I did when it first came out in 1986 with all the hype Somehow I found Nic Cage s character off putting Way off putting Then the plot didn t seem to make sense Then by the end of the credits the question came to mind What point was this movie making What was it saying The answer unfortunately was not much if anything I really don t think this movie aimed at making a statement unless it was your life is your life you re gonna make the same mistakes no matter what so keep your eye upon the doughnut and not the hole Not a very profound statement and I m sorry not profoundly made in this movie The writing simply isn t that good The direction is uneven and is strangely overblown at times Kathleen Turner was the best and in my opinion only worthwhile thing in this movie and performed something of a miracle creating a whole character despite bizarre unexplained circumstances with a script that had no apparent statement to make br br She also finally cleared up the mystery for me of the main reason I didn t enjoy this movie more She states in her autobiography that Cage made a point of fighting his uncle Coppola s direction every step of the way doing it his own way not a good idea for a new actor and putting on a goofy voice she called stupid His voice was annoying abrasive and unnatural and his character was obnoxious and overbearing as a young guy I understand what he was attempting to do play a young guy hot shot who is not as hot as he thinks he is setting up his own karma for future failure But he goes overboard the way he does it is abrasive not effective and if he had listened to his uncle instead of fighting the Man we would have had a more enjoyable film Cage slips a little with his obnoxious voice stylings in the movie and occasionally sounds like a real person and those scenes are more watchable than others But if I had to watch the movie through in its entirety I would find myself wanting to pay someone in L A to pour a bucket of water over his head during some of his more affected put on scenes br br The movie doesn t aim for a statement doesn t make a point is great to look at except when Cage is doing a demented Elvis impression but without the voice and is ultimately confusing and a waste of time Given all this Kathleen Turner surely deserved an Oscar in this flailing mess of a movie I can t recommend anyone spending two hours watching this unless you like Turner and have a remote to pick out all her scenes Believe me you will miss nothing plotwise by skipping the other scenes and it will make just as much sense br br Kathleen Turner is getting a lot of flak from critics regarding her Cage comments which proves that she s strong enough to be honest and to hell with other people s comments You go Turner I m not particularly a fan of this actress any more than I am of any other first rate actor or actress but her candor is refreshing Cage s acting can be good to annoying and here it doesn t work At least in this film now we know why
Did Francis Ford Coppola have a brain aneurysm some time after directing Apocalypse Now that made him absolutely incapable of making a good movie br br You have to wonder what the director of The Godfather and The Conversation was thinking when he made this flabby film It gives Kathleen Turner a starring vehicle playing a woman who travels back in time and gets to redo her adolescence knowing all of the things that life as an adult has taught her and Turner the trooper that she is does what she can with it but this movie couldn t be saved by anyone br br It doesn t even have any style to it and given its director one would expect that even if it had nothing else it would have that br br Grade C
This movie is an embarrassment to film making I can t believe it was even listed as a comedy not funny Not only was the script atrocious but the casting people should be shot Gail O Grady is just a great actress but beyond that 99 of the rest of the cast ouch Pretty much everyone else wow it is hard to even wow Here is the number one rule about comedy DON T TRY TO BE FUNNY There are a lot of very talented actors in Canada who can do drama and comedy none of them were used in this film Canadian nepotism and casting directors are helping to perpetuate bad film making in Canada I realize this is technically a US film but look at the director actors location etc I just saw this on Bravo they should be ashamed that they bought the rights to show this film Again there are a lot of great films out there that can t get airtime and they show this crap
A great slasher movie too bad it was the producers and not part of the script Basic plot summary man with redhead fetish goes invites such women to his flat only to go into some kind of freakish coma and proceeds in offing them to various degrees of success Only the cutting crew behind the scenes must have thought the movie was as ad as I did and chopped the heck out of the movie Nothing flows you get lost on which redhead he is with at the time didn t he off that one earlier and most of the time it looks like the camera man passed out and resumed filming when he awoke Not that I can blame him I passed out 2 3 times and had to rewind and resume to try to regain what little plot that does exist Warning when you see the ending DO NOT try to connect it with anything that happens before you will just get an aneurysm Not worth the time effort or God forbid money Only reason to get a 2 instead of a 1 the slim chance that the hacking occurred between film release and the horrible version that I watched
Oh those Italians Assuming that movies about aristocrats with weird fetishes castles drowned in gothic atmosphere and back stabbing relatives trying to get their hands on an inheritance are inherently interesting to all If you ve seen one film of this type you ve basically seen them all the MST3K favorite Screaming Skull fits the mold too and The Night Evelyn Came Out of the Grave is formulaic by the numbers and dull as hell Even the luscious Erika Blanc is put to waste here br br zero 10 br br
SOILER It s fake The whole thing is a fake There is no ghosts or zombies Alan is a Lord and his cousin or brother or half brother or something like that wants the castle and his title for himself So he invests this overly complicated and needless pointless plan ala SCOOBY DOO to drive Alan to commit suicide Most of the movie is him picking up redheads and attacking them He s not even killing them He drops off to sleep and the girl vanishes and he thinks he buried them someplace If he looked at the so called ghost of Evelyn he could tell she was wearing gloves My God what a waste of time Don t bother watching it renting and if you bought it and haven t watched it yet sell it Quickly Do yourself a favor and stay away from THE NIGHT EVELYN CAME OUT OF THE GRAVE I give this stinker the CRAP O LANTERN
Exceptionally horrible tale that I can barely put into words The best part of the movie was when one of the murder victims turns up at the end alive and well only to be massacred again There is the chance that I missed some crucial plot elements since I may have been in a slight coma during the time this baby was on The box that the movie comes in shows scenes that are never even in the film I was lured in by the crude images of bondage torture and promises of a Euro trash sexy horror flick I get the feeling this was the budget version and about one quarter of the film was left out All the good stuff more than likely I got the PG 13 addition that made about as much sense as the end to the new Planet of the Apes movie Watch this one with a friend and a bottle of the hard stuff You ll need it
THE NIGHT EVELYN CAME OUT OF THE GRAVE Emilio Miraglia Italy 1971 br br I only watched this delirious piece of Euro tosh in the way of Alpha Video s dreadful DVD release looks like an extremely bad video transfer but from what I saw not nearly interesting enough to purchase No Shame s recent DVD release Considering their excellent track record it will undoubtedly be a major improvement over all previous releases And don t pay attention to the ridiculous cover shown here it s not taken from this film some girl holding the head of a Jim Carrey look a like br br Spaghetti Western star Anthony Steffen sports a hip hairdo and assumes the role of Lord Alan Cunningham a man haunted by the memory of his dead wife Evelyn This leads to a nervous breakdown which has him being retained in a psychiatric clinic Once released Cunningham channels this trauma by taking redheaded prostitutes to his countryside castle subjecting them to vicious acts of torture His doctor and friend Richard Timberlane what do you mean Italian horror names sound made up advises him to forget the past and remarry but Cunningham is obsessed with Evelyn and even organizes a séance at the castle Eventually after killing some more girls he meets Gladys another redhead and marries her almost immediately but the arrival of his new wife spawns a series of sinister events Bloodthirsty creatures strike at Sir Alan s family killing them off one by one Becoming more distraught Cunningham visits Evelyn s tomb and discovers it to be empty Soon a number of outsiders begin to suspect something fishy is going on in the castle and Lord Cunningham s treatment might not have been that successful after all br br Director Emilio Miraglia tries to blend Gothic horror with Giallo conventions with limited success As usual not the slightest effort was made to convince audiences the film is set in England The cars drive on the right side of the road everyone looks very Mediterranean and the castle and the rest of the architecture is patently Italian This is common practice in Italian horror but sometimes they just take this a little too far The bad print made this even slightly bearable since it s so dark you couldn t see much of the surroundings anyway But then again this is the kind of film where anything can happen in the name of exploitation and depicting reality isn t really the issue A large part consists of sado masochistic torture scenes in the castle torture chamber but most of the time Anthony Steffen hams his way through this and shows some horrible over acting I guess it all depends on your state of mind and this can be a fun piece of nonsense if you re in the right mood I just couldn t take it at least not with the print I watched A pleasant score though by Bruno Nicolai which combines easy listening tunes with some psychedelic rock numbers br br Camera Obscura 4 10
Lord Alan Cunningham Antonio De Teffè is a nutjob seen early on trying to escape an insane asylum with this castle slowly succumbing to ruin likes to kill various hookers who resemble his deceased wife Evelyn a woman who betrayed him for another man with those red locks This nutcase is quite wealthy and his bachelor status can be quite alluring He however is overrun by his obsession with his late wife s memory specifically her adultery he saw her naked with the lover While the memory of Evelyn is almost devouring his whole existence Alan tries his best to find true love and believes he has with Gladys Marina Malfatti who spends most of the film naked that s probably her lone attribute since she isn t a very good actress who agrees to marry him after a very short courtship which should probably throw up flags right away there s a key moment of dialogue where she knows exactly to the very amount what he is worth br br The only real person Alan can confide in is his doctor from the hospital Dr Richard Timberlane Giacomo Rossi Stuart There are other key characters in this film that revolve around Alan Alan s cousin George Rod Murdock seems to be quite a good friend who often supplies him victims I mean dates while holding onto hope of getting his lord s estate some day Albert Roberto Maldera Evelyn s brother is a witness to Alan s slaughter and instead of turning him into the police squeezes him for cash Aunt Agatha Joan C Davis wheelchair bound lives at the castle estate and is often seen snooping around behind cracked doors We later find that she is having a love affair with Albert br br All that is described above services the rest of the story which shows what appears to be the ghost of Evelyn haunting Alan someone is killing off members of the cast family that revolve around Alan and the body of Evelyn is indeed missing br br The ultimate question is who is committing the crimes after Alan and Gladys are married where is Evelyn s body and will Alan go over the edge I have to be honest and say I just didn t really care much for this film It s badly uneven and the pacing is all over the place It looks great on the new DVD and the rising from the grave sequence is cool but what really hurts the film in my mind is that the entire cast is unlikable You really have a hard time caring for Alan because he is a psychotic who is skating on thin ice in regards to holding his sanity He can be quite volatile Who commits the crime really isn t that great a surprise for after several key characters are murdered off there aren t but a choice few who could be doing it What happens to Alan doesn t really make your throat gulp because you can make the argument he s just getting what he deserves Those behind the whole scheme of the film in regards to Alan as I pointed out before aren t that shocking because if you are just slightly aware of certain circumstances or advantages they d have that would benefit them with the collapse of Alan s sanity then everything just comes off less than stellar I thought the editing was choppy and unexciting but the acting from the entire cast is really below par Some stylistics help and there is a sniff of Gothic atmosphere in the graveyard sequences to help it some

This Italian semi horror movie starts out very much like a soft core porn movie and turns into a mystery that has a few to many loose ends to be good that and the fact it is rather dull just makes this film rather unwatchable for my tastes The only thing really worth watching are the many boobs spread throughout the film The story has a guy who at the beginning of the movie luring girls to his castle where he proceeds to take them to his dungeon go berserk and seemingly kill them They show the nudity but they never really show the murders at this point in the film Then the guy finds a nice red head at a party and proceeds to make out with her and marry her He has a thing for red heads you see as his beloved former wife Evelyn was also one she also died under circumstances that must have not been the viewing audience s business After a lot of talky scenes murders start to take place involving snakes foxes and such At this point it is easy enough to figure out who is responsible for the murders and what the motive is then you have a nonsensical ending where everything wraps up not so nicely This movie just did not work for me it left me with to many questions and the last third of the film just did not have the boobs of the first two thirds of the film Explaining Evelyn s death would have helped the film as would have some sort of ending where Evelyn did rise from the grave Granted the title is not totally misleading as she did sort of leave the grave just not under her own power The gore is very light for the most part as there is a scene with the foxes and a scene at the end with quite a bit of blood too I just thought for the most part this movie was a tad dull
Italian horror suspense film about a wealthy English lord who cruises pubs and taverns for girls with red hair just like his recently deceased wife Evelyn You know he must have really loved his wife because he brings them to his home a huge rotting castle and makes them disrobe and then tortures them whips them and kills them The most bizarre aspect of this film for me was that somehow by the film s end we see this guy played by Antonio De Teffe as the HERO of the film Anyway soon under the advice of his playboy uncle Roberto Maldera De Teffe settles down with a girl he meets at his uncle s party She moves in and strange things begin to happen to De Teffe s fragile state of mind He begins to see and hear his dead wife and finally well just look at the title if you are still curious Also family members and friends begin to die in the most brutal fashions Poor Aunt Agatha she looks like she might even be younger than De Teffe and they have her in a wheelchair and trying to look old meets her fate in a foxy fashion Another man is injected and then buried alive And of course there is a whole explanation as to why how Evelyn did what she did Director Emilio Miraglia does do some things fairly well the settings in the film are well suited for this film though trying to make us believe it is England is ludicrous at best None of the actors look English Many having dark black hair and Mediterranean complexions and wearing clothes an Englishman wouldn t be caught dead in The cars drive on their wrong side of the road But all that notwithstanding the crypt scene was effectively shot and I liked the cheesy resolution too And of course any film with the sultry red headed Erika Blanc is always a plus There is a streak of sexual perversion however which I found somewhat appalling with the idea that torturing women was quite alright and healthy in order to relieve one of his mental demons C mon
So far after week two of The lone of Beauty I am a little disappointed br br Some of the acting is good as long as we except that it is only drama br br I am unsure how people can feel that this FICTIONAL DRAMA is factual coverage of the Thatcher years it is okay as drama but I feel the award winning book is still much better br br I Wonder if the BBC will ever give us the follow up and the next part of the drama and the years that follow with Things Can Only Get Better finishing with 2006 and the Fact that we are still waiting with that promise from a Government that is full of sleaze
Perhaps I couldn t find the DVD menu selection for PLOT ON OFF Clearly the default is OFF When the end credits began to roll I couldn t believe that was it Like our poor but beautiful protagonist I felt used dirty cheap br br The characters were drawn in very broad strokes and the writer s disdain for wealthy Thatcherites was all to apparent I consider myself a Roosevelt Democrat but would appreciate a bit more subtlety br br Of course the problem could be with me I see that many others seem to find some meaning or message in this picture Alas not I br br The only thing that kept me from giving this a 1 was the nice scenery human and plant
I decided to watch this serial after seeing the endless adverts for it on the BBC in the weeks prior to it starting I watched it despite the fact that I don t like the pretentious kind of stuff that Alan Hollinghurst writes sorry to his fans but I think we have a case of the emperor s new clothes with this author s work I admit that the acting is excellent it is beautifully shot and I was reasonably entertained by it however I found that the storyline was extremely thin and after watching all three episodes feel very unsatisfied with this rather empty production The explicit gay sex that the media droned on about has all been done before on TV several times so it was nothing very shocking I m afraid Full marks for production values but low ones for storyline content I m afraid
This British pot boiler has one thing going for it the young men are uniformly good looking The older men are opinionated right wing Thatcherites whose behavior brings back all the acrimony of the Reagan Thatcher years Young or old however morals in this three part mini series are universally suspect and no one comes off particularly well br br Nick is a handsome young gay man fresh out of Oxford It is not pivotal to the story but he has an extraordinarily beautiful head of hair which makes watching this drivel much easier Nick comes to London with a friend whose father Gerald is a rich conservative politician and babysits his sister Cat while the family frolics in the south of France They neglect to inform him that when upset Cat cuts herself with an assortment of knives and other kitchen implements Nick mistakes their self serving gratitude for affection and moves in finding out too late just how much they despise and patronize him Inexplicably Nick lives in this house for four years but as the plot depends on this point it s best not to question it br br While Nick is most pleasing to look at he is unbearably obsequious His coy subjection to rich bigots soon had me climbing the walls Deeply closeted except to Cat she guesses his big secret on sight he does like a little anonymous sex just so we know he is actually gay Though it hardly seems possible Nick takes a lover who is even more closeted than he br br Supercilious Tories scorn and insult the two blacks in the film so imagine the venom which spews forth when Nick s sexual orientation is reported in a tabloid Gerald in true Tory fashion has become involved in several personal and financial scandals so the revelations about Nick add to his embarrassment This gives Gerald one final opportunity to roundly castigate the hapless boy br br Except for one brief moment of indignation Nick takes the abuse heaped upon him in silence and tacit agreement Denial self loathing naiveté or ignorance You decide if you can manage to sit through this whole thing without throwing something at the set
Even if you subscribe to the knee jerk anti free trade politics of this movie it is still just the same tired note played again and again and again Clink clink clink Even if you can accept a preacher with peroxide hair who advocates a return to first principles the Reverend Billy is pretty hard to look at as a serious figure The clownish reverend is the sort who wakes every morning with no aspiration more ethereal than to see his own face on TV before he climbs back into bed that night He has a pretty wife I have to admit but it would take tons more than that to save this dreary mess of a movie The interminable bus rides are the worst part with progress shown can you guess by a colored line moving across a map Aww you guessed Oh well it has the virtue of being short Is that the only favorable thing I can say Hmmmm Yep afraid so
the intention the directors has for this films are quite honorable but his history of his productions did get me aware that this might not get much to the core like other film makers would do it keeping his great 30 days TV series in mind but also counting in his MTV production i bet you will that opposes his seriousness in any of the matters he documents and also counting in his rather disappointing production supersize me i did not had my hopes up high sadly enough this movie disappointed me none the less as with supersize me after a while i did ask myself what exactly the point of all this was the main statement gets clear enough after half an hour but the rest of the playtime gets filled with rather pointless stuff and re repeating stuff that were already shown in this way or another earlier in the movie so it wears out and gets extremely boring towards the end
This film is just another distortion among many distortions on the so called sins of consumerism Please note that Reverend Billy an actor Bill Talen is nothing more than a bureaucrat against the sins of consumerism We might want to ask are questions like What does Reverend Billy do for a living How does he make his money Does he make his living off his tax deductible organization How does the Internal Revenue justify this as a tax deductible church or organization br br Everyone knows that Christmas is commercialized but it affords one day out of a whole year in which people have an opportunity to be charitable and allows a significant number of people to spend time with their families friends or extended families Everyone is not charitable Everyone does not spend time with their families friends or extended families But holidays and vacation time give people that chance and opportunity Yes America does have more than its share of problems but with perseverance Americans have and always make it through great difficulties And even in times of strife America has proved itself to be the greatest country in the world That happens when Americans pull together and unite rather than to separate and divide Yes there are problems with corporations and monopolies but it will take Americans to bring back the small businesses along with the ethics to responsibly care for people living in our individual communities Yes globalization has brought us its share of problems but it will take Americans to bring production back to America Americans and the U S government need to learn how to stay on a budget no matter how large or small it may be and we must stop our dependence on credit Our over reliance on credit will make and keep us poor from the cradle to the grave It is important to buy but if we buy less we will rely less on credit And if we are able to save even a small amount of money we will have money for a rainy day Not to say that as Americans we will gain an equal share of wealth Wealth is not guaranteed and has never been guaranteed But stratification teaches us that only a small percentage of Americans hold most of America s wealth There is a good proximity that you or I can reach the level of the upper middle class And who knows what can happen from there Be positive work hard and at the very least you and I will be able to reach at least some if not all of our dreams In life nothing is guaranteed but we always have that something to reach for And if you or I don t have dreams we might as well be dead In America there is always room for plenty of hopes and dreams As individuals we are a part of the pack but we always can become the leader of the pack br br It has always been my experience that churches and religion do offer nothing more than additional distortions but I pay dignity and give respect to people with other beliefs values and perspectives But as far as the distortions expressed within this film I do not have any faith in such beliefs values and perspectives I rank this film with a 1 out of 10 but in all honesty and truth this film deserves a zero This film has no integrity and I cannot recommend it
Slow boring extremely repetitive No wonder the Weinstein Company did not buy this This Spurlock should eat more McDonalds while filming himself and quit producing There is no way you can watch this and enjoy The preacher is a joke The whole idea is not funny You can make a 2 minute film with this idea not a feature I am so sorry I rented this movie I will never watch anything with the name Spurlock on it It is completely garbage Filmmakers like this should be on youtube and never be granted a distribution deal The film states that the American Consumers and their shopping are at fault for the current depression when shopping and buying products making money circulate in the system are the base of a healthy economy
I came here for a review last night before deciding which TV movie to settle in front of and those I found made this one look unmissable How misled I feel br br Firstly it needs to be pointed out up front that this is very much a housewife s daytime movie The performances are wooden every sentence is an attempt at poignant in the way that housewife s daytime movies and bad soap operas always are and it is based in that predictable and well trodden premise that men particularly soldiers are essentially violent and incompassionate The whole movie is about the drama apparent in the moments when the male characters threaten to develop a second dimension br br If that sounds tolerable or even enjoyable to you then be warned Linda Hamilton s German accent while quite good is painfully distracting as is her face for some reason The other performances are no doubt an enduring source of embarrassment to their perpetrators with painfully thin and obvious characterizations being the order of the day There are few surprises but do watch for the Monty Pythonesque endless supply of food and drink that miraculously appears from the hungry soldiers knapsacks br br I wasn t expecting action but I had hoped for beautiful or textural or emotionally charged What I got was a particularly bad Christmas feelgood story that will have an intelligent audience cringing with the crapulence of it all br br Watch it under the folowing circumstances 1 There s nothing else on 2 You are a fan of predictable housewife takes on men and wins TV movies 3 The only way you can appreciate a true story is when Hollywood turns it into a feature film 4 You ve imbibed enough nog that your emotions are easily stirred by unsophisticated storytelling
Goodnight Mister Tom begins in an impossibly exquisite village in the south of England where the sun always seems to shine Before we have much idea of the period we hear a radio announcement of the declaration of World War II Soon a train blowing clouds of steam brings refugee children from London and when shy little William is billeted with reluctant gruff old Tom who you just know will turn out to have a heart of gold our tale begins br br And what a load of sentimental claptrap it is In fact it s just the old odd couple buddy formula Aren t any new stories being written br br As I suggested there s hardly any period feel in the village and not much more in London apart from the odd old ambulance rattling around And certainly no hint of the horror of the Blitz as London s citizens file politely into air raid shelters Even when the local schoolteacher s husband is declared missing presumed killed he is later restored to life br br I found Goodnight Mister Tom cliched and obvious and John Thaw s accent conjured up a picture of Ronnie Barker of the Two Ronnies with a straw in his mouth doing his country bumpkin accent br br Incidentally my wife enjoyed this movie for all the reasons that I disliked it and looking at fellow imdb reviewers I seem to be in a minority of one br br
I have been familiar with the fantastic book of Goodnight Mister Tom for absolutely ages and it was only recently when I got the chance to watch this adaption of it I have heard lots of positive remarks about this so I had high hopes Once this film had finished I was horrified br br This film is not a good film at all Goodnight Mister Tom was an extremely poor adaption and practically 4 5 10 of the book was missed out Particularly I found that a lot of the characters and some great scenes in the book were not in this There was not much dialogue It was rushed and far too fast moving but I was mostly upset by the fact that you never got to see the bonding and love between William Beech and Tom in this film which was a true let down The casting was not all that good either I thought this could have been really good but it was so different to the book Anextremely poor adaption one of the worst I ve seen This deserves a decent remake that d better be 1000 times better than this pile of garbage
Saw it at UCSB s reel loud festival and was shocked that it won the golden reel award I wasn t the only one considering the audience had mixed reactions to the piece I thought there were many other better flicks out there but then I learned that the judges were heavily rooted within the area of film theory and other artsy crap While the cinematography and editing are on par with many other shorts out there the storytelling is nothing more than your average student piece Seems as though serious student films need to include one of these categories sex intrapersonal struggle and eventual suicide Nick and Kate cops out and includes all three Please be more original br br Oh and it might be my outsider s opinion but the guy from montecito sounds a little fake Does anyone else thing so
The director tries to be Quentin Tarantino the screenwriters try to be Tennessee Williams Deborah Kara Unger tries to be Faye Dunaway the late James Coburn tries to be Orson Welles Michael Rooker tries to be Gene Hackman Mary Tyler Moore tries to be Faye Dunaway older version Cameron Diaz tries to get out of the frame as quickly as she can successfully don t ask about Joanna Going Eric Stoltz and James Spader try to conceal their embarrassment with this crappy stuff It delivers endless meaningless dialog and very little action br br Tulsa is a town with beautiful elevator lobbies an art deco church by Bruce Goff and a lovely sprawling mansion by Frank Lloyd Wright Visit Tulsa don t watch this movie It doesn t do the location justice
Perhaps the biggest waste of production time money and the space on the video store shelf If someone suggests you see this movie run screaming in the other direction Unless of course you re into self abuse
I have to admit I don t remember much about the characters or the story though I m not sure there was one I was soooo irritated by this movie that I had a bit of a hard time focusing on it How can you name a movie Keys to Tulsa and then film it in Texas The flat desert country around Arlington I think that was the location in no way resembles the green rolling hills around Tulsa and a celebrity in Tulsa would have a much nicer neighborhood to live in Obviously no one in the movie has EVER BEEN to Tulsa or else they would have realized how nothing in the movie even resembled it Hadn t anyone at least seen Rumblefish or The Outsiders I know this sounds picky but I can t help it I watched this because I love James Spader and I usually find Eric Stotz interesting But even these two intriguing actors could not liven up this meandering and mean story of self involved people who are NOT IN TULSA I m sorry it can t be more expensive to film in Oklahoma What if To Live and Die in LA had been shot in Toronto Would that suck Well so does this
If you want to see a mystery don t watch this Though there are elements straight out of Elmore Leonard territory this comes closer to an episode of Dynasty since the filmmaker focuses on character development i e long boring talks between stupid un involving characters Some people can make fascinating movies without real action see Exotica but not this one Avoid it especially if you like the actors involved in this one
This is a genuinely horrible film The plot such as it is is totally undecipherable I think it has something to do with blackmail but I m not entirely certain br br Half of the dialogue consists of useless cliches The other half is spoken by the various actors in such unintelligible imitations of southern accents that thankfully the words cannot be recognized br br But the one true tragedy of the movie is that such a historic talent as Mary Tyler Moore apparently was in such dire financial or personal circumstances that she appeared in it br br
I am glad to see most other people here don t think much of this movie either It has some big names in the cast but that s it There is nothing else to recommend save ogling a few pretty women which you can do in a thousand films br br The story involves nothing but unlikable self centered chain smoking hip characters that national film critics all seem to like and most of the public can t stand br br The Oklahoma accents are so fake they are laughable the southern racist stereotypes are right from Liberal Hollywood 101 and the story is depressing
This movie introduces quite an array of characters and their relationships in the first half hour or so None of them generate any interest or positive response I waited for the intrigue to begin hoping things would get better and ended up sticking around until the bitter end but there was no reward for doing that br br If you want a synopsis look elsewhere To me the action isn t worth recounting Not that the story was that bad I guess you could say I had some problems with the script i e I thought it stunk A look at the credits will show you that there s a pretty strong cast here used to no avail Most of the old pros in this flick do good jobs of the actors I hadn t seen much of before I especially liked Deborah Kara Unger That s about all that I can find good to say about this picture
About twenty minutes into this movie I was already bored Quite simply these characters were fairly dull Occasionally something enjoyable would happen but then things would slow down again Fortunately my patience was eventually rewarded and the ending to this movie wasn t bad at all However it was by no means good enough to justify sitting through the first ninety minutes So I would say that the movie was mediocre overall and considering all of the talent in the cast I d call this a disappointment
What happened Those were the first words to come to mind after this awful movie finished for the first and last time on my computer screen Nightmare on Elm St had gone noticeably downhill after it s cult classic of a first film but I doubt anybody expected this horrible aberration Nobody expected this cosmic joke of a film and nobody is more distraught about it than I am br br This is by far the worst ANOES film of the lot It doesn t seem too bad at the beginning with a genuinely creepy intro and a rather elongated shower scene featuring Alice But then we hit rock bottom right at the beginning with bad acting and a jumbled sequence of events I mean sure Freddy movies are supposed to be dreamlike and creepy but this one is like a train wreck in it s poor sequencing of events and awful plot setup It feels like you re coming down with a terrible headache not like you re getting scared So the directing totally fails None of the suspense and well crafted horror from previous sequels is found here and even the death scenes are mostly just crass and moronic the death by food especially except for that one cool scene that s crafted like a comic book battle That s why this movie gets a point br br The storyline lame lame lame LAME It was an excuse to gross people out and to make the MPAA mad and nothing more br br The acting should I mention how Freddy has been turned into a childish boogey man like clown figure How his rebirth scene made him look like a monster out of a 7 year old s horror book instead of the foreboding and nightmarish dream killer we ve all known and loathed since the first film That arm waving and stupid chuckling as he appeared again ugh And his one liners too Throughout the whole movie they suck Badly A grade schooler could come up with funnier stuff then the vomit Freddy spews throughout the 90 minute duration of the film Hell a chimpanzee could come up with much funnier lines than what Freddy s been told to say here Who wrote the script for this This movie is really irritating too It seems so pointless Like a gnat buzzing around your head a gnat that just WON T go away Freddy is just an annoyance now We ve seen him so many times before This one s nothing different and a lot of the time you just want him to take his awful one liners and get off your TV screen Alice instead of the thoughtful and quiet girl from the last movie seems annoying and very shallow and this is obviously due to the horrible horrible script this movie was fitted with Lisa Wilcox may be a great actor and sometimes it shines through the cracks here but she can t save this movie The other actors just suck mostly br br The last 15 or 20 minutes of Freddy s existence in this film are awful and embarrassing I hope Englund was ashamed of this Who wants to see Freddy running around like a mutated gorilla with his limbs stretched out laughing like a cartoon villain This movie destroyed anything positive I felt for the Nightmare series I can t ever watch them again without this image running through my head of the mangled cartoon abomination that Krueger became He was slowly becoming a jokey retarded pop culture icon but this is the lowest of the low This is rock bottom Nobody will ever take Freddy Krueger seriously again after seeing this film He s naught but a joke a clown that is long overdue for retirement Pathetic br br Of all the movies I could hate why did it have to be Nightmare on Elm St a series which I once adored and liked a lot The Dream Child represents the death of a legend and the shattering of any hope I had in the Nightmare on Elm St series Freddy would go on to continue his downward spiral into clown status in the next installment Freddy s Dead which was more entertaining than this was actually and then he would go on to bring down the mood in Freddy VS Jason and finally he would putter out into nothing which is for the best br br I know this has mostly been a rant about why Freddy sucks now but this movie is overall horrible and one of the worst movies ever made Not recommended to anyone and even ANOES completionists won t want to see this one again
A Nightmare on Elm Street The Dream Child br br This is a bad movie There s no escaping it I love the series and I think Freddy is probably the best character ever in horror movies But even being a fan I can t help but see this movie is mediocre br br There s not even an effort to build an interesting story and strong characters By now they had just given up They don t even try They are the production of course hoping for a few more easy dollars br br The story doesn t grab your attention Its so simple it s almost absent br br Alice a survivor from part 4 is now pregnant Freddy is coming back through the baby s dreams At the beginning we learn that to stop him Alice must find his mother And that s it br br The story advances slowly since there s so little plot meaning it turns pretty boring after a few minutes of bad dialogues and awful acting In fact that s the only scary thing the acting since the deaths are not even slightly cool br br The characters are so uninteresting we couldn t care less for them br br The girls are as unattractive as possible The whole cast reminded me of a bad amateur theatre group I ve seen better actors in school plays It s embarrassing really br br Lisa Wilcox still manages to bring some class to this She is beautiful sexy and has some talent But the material just didn t let her shine What a pity br br Stephen Hopkins work is nowhere close to Renny Harlin s brilliant direction in Dream Master He tries some imaginative shots near the end but that tension Harlin and Craven created so well in the previous movies is no where to be found br br The Dream Child is just another unimaginative sequel It s the kind of movie that give horror series a bad name br br The end for the once scary Freddy It s too sad to see him now A clown that s not funny A bad joke Goodbye Freddy
This one is just like the 6th movie The movie is really bad It offers nothing in the death department The one liners are bad and are something that shouldn t be in a NOES movie Freddy comes off as a happy child in the whole movie Lisa Wilcox is still the only thing that makes this one worth while The characters are extremely underdeveloped All in all better than the 6th one but still one the worst movies of the series My rating 2 10
Come on The new twist is nearly ok but from avenging the Elm Street children Freddy is just killing people now More of the same Special effects with no actual character development or anything Simply bad and insulting SCARY Nope Not at all Just bad
Bottom of the Freddy barrel This is the worst film in the series beating Freddy s Revenge for that title A cheap looking with mediocre special effects incoherent mess with Freddy turned into a punster He has one or two cool lines but that doesn t save this illogical and sloppy sequel
It s getting worse the series is on a serious down fall The first two sequel were acceptable and from then on we have seen a buch of really really terrible movies Robert Englund gives another great performance as Freddy but the rest of the cast can t act The story is Alice having survived the previous installment of the Nightmare series finds the deadly dreams of Freddy Krueger starting once again This time the taunting murderer is striking through the sleeping mind of Alice s unborn child His intention is to be born again into the real world The only one who can stop Freddy is his dead mother but can Alice free her spirit in time to save her own son Check out the first three miss the next three then watch the last one
This film is so incredibly bad that I almost felt sick watching it Up until this point the other installments had at least one good thing about it Part 1 was suspenseful and gory Part 2 was off beat and entertaining Part 3 was interesting with great effects Part 4 had great music good special effects and a new entertaining Freddy Krueger Part 5 is more boring than anything I ve ever seen before Alice a much prettier blond from Part 4 is back with her boyfriend Dan At parts this supposed Elm Street installment turns into a daytime soap The newer characters seem harsh and even that sweet Alice has a chip on her shoulder Freddy seems to be completely out of this one He looks tired and doesn t seem to be as gruesome His one liners seem out of place and different where as in Part 4 they could be pretty funny Leslie Bohem s story never gets off the ground and Stephen Hopkins direction is so bad that it makes my grandmother look good The whole plot of this movie is ridiculous and unrealistic It s also confusing and pretty stupid Avoid Part 5 at all costs
I am still trying to determine whether the previous installment was worse than this one or vice versa Being that it is nearly fifteen years since I saw this film the fact that I remember so little about it does not bode well Perhaps it is simply because I only watched it once or twice but I doubt it If there was anything worth remembering about this film you can rest assured I would remember it br br At the time this film was released the franchise was still entering its dying phase so a lot of media coverage was allotted to it It s never a good sign when teenie pop magazines contain explanations of the plot basics One such article had to explain that Freddy was left too weak to infest the dreams of grown humans so he decides to go after Alice s unborn son So far so good but this is the job of the writer or the director to explain to the audience It should not be left to some unrelated publication br br Making use of the trivia given in part three about Freddy s conception one could half expect scenes that would lift this joke out of the horror for infants category but alas that was not to be It goes to show the sheer idiocy of the American ratings system that a piece of B harni esque garbage like this could get the same rating as a genuinely frightening piece like the original br br By this time the franchise could not attract anyone with an active career Fortunately or unfortunately depending on how you look at it Lisa Wilcox was there to provide a quotient of competent acting Or perhaps she just looks competent by comparison to the rest of the cast Either way given that her last role was in something called The All New Adventures of Chastity Blade I doubt she really had anything else going for her Even poor old Robert Englund has been in better productions than that in the past fifteen years br br Given that box office returns were in a steady decline and not just for this franchise at the time one would have thought that the studios would realize neutering their films does not make them more saleable In fact this particular film like its immediate predecessor was so neutered that not only did it fail to attract a new audience both succeeded in alienating the core audience that originally supported the franchise Despite this part five must be given some credit for not having the bright luminescent feeling that made part four so insulting to look at br br I gave A Nightmare On Elm Street Part Five a one out of ten By trying to appeal to everyone or the MPAA s idea of everyone it succeeds in appealing to noone Like parts two and four one could erase it from the continuity entirely and nobody would notice the difference
I consider this film one of the worst in the Nightmare series It was so boring that I couldn t remember a thing 20 minutes after the film was over it even tires me to write a review on it br br Okay 4 was a joke and Freddy was the joker 5 tried to return to the roots of the series It was darker and more atmospheric than Nightmare 4 which is a good thing basically They tried to shoot a horror film instead of a comedy Unfortunately they forgot to add suspense and scares Because of that Nightmare 5 The Dream Child is neither funny nor is it scary What we actually get is a boring film with the usual bad actors maybe with the exception of Lisa Wilcox br br The plot Freddy killing Lisa s friends by using the dreams of Lisa s unborn child has a good base but it just isn t enough for 90 minutes of film Sometimes the story gets very confusing maybe because there isn t any and you can t stop wondering what the filmmakers were aiming at The screenplay must have had more holes than Swiss Cheese and the film therefore was very cheesy itself let me say that I don t like cheese though even if I am from Switzerland Not even the special effects were as good as for example in part 4 br br Don t bother to rent buy this film if not for completeness it s quite a mess br br My rating 4 10 get used to it 6 is also a messy one
Like Freddy s Revenge this sequel takes a pretty weird idea and doesn t go to great lengths to squeeze a story out of it Basically Alice from number 4 is pregnant and her baby is haunted by Freddy which gives him an outlet to haunt her friends This has the least deaths out of the whole series and the wise cracks are quite poor so neither the horror fans or comedy fans are happy br br I ve not alot to say about this It s moderately interesting to see the characters of Alice and Dan returning from four but not worth watching a movie over Uninspriring and unenjoyable possibly only the competant direction saves it from being the worst in the series
STAR RATING Saturday Night Friday Night Friday Morning Sunday Night Monday Morning br br Alice having defeated Freddy at the end of the last film is now trying to re adjust her life But her unborn child is carrying a demonous presence Freddy trying to come out into their world again br br It s interesting to note the directors who got their big breaks directing Freddy films Charles Russell Eraser The Mask Renny Harlin The Long Kiss Goodnight Cutthroat Island Cliffhanger Die Hard 2 and here Stephen Hopkins Lost in Space Predator 2 But while Russell and Harlin made a good job of it Hopkins IMO has made something of a podge with this entry that should be quickly forgotten br br The story is clearly being stretched as far as it can go here with Freddy ludicrously a father himself and the ridiculous looking demon baby Even at about an hour and a half it all gets rather tiresome and of course not scary at all br br The bon appetit bitch catch phrase is the only memorable point of this other wise very forgettable entry
The Dream Child of 1989 is the fifth film in the generally overrated Nightmare series and at the latest from this point on the series became total garbage The only good films in the series were Wes Craven s 1984 original and the third part The Dream Warriors of 1987 The second part was disappointing and boring and it was the fourth part in which the formerly scary madman Freddy Krueger began to annoy with constant idiotic jokes This fifth entry to the series has hardly anything to recommend except for admittedly great visuals and one creepy scene a flashback sequence to how Freddy Krueger came into existence The rest of the film consists mainly of our razor clawed maniac turned jokester yelling stupid one liners and the old formula of a bunch of teenage jackasses who desperately try to avoid falling asleep because good old Freddy awaits them in their dreams Lisa Wilcox is back in the role of Alice Johnson and a bunch of uninteresting crap such as a super dumb eerie children s rhyme is added for no other reason than to have some sort of justification for making this superfluous and boring sequel In Short No originality just a decline of the old formula and an over load of painfully annoying jokes My generous rating of 3 10 is due to the great visuals and especially to emphasize the difference to the terrible next sequel Freddy s Dead which is awful beyond belief In case you re not a hardcore Freddy Krueger enthusiast The Dream Child should be avoided and even if you are this is more than likely to disappoint
I will stat of with the plot Alice having survived the previous instalment of the Nightmare series finds the deadly dreams of Freddy Krueger starting once again This time the taunting murderer is striking through the sleeping mind of Alice s unborn child His intention is to be born again into the real world The only one who can stop Freddy is his dead mother but can Alice free her spirit in time to save her own son This movie did start of really well as we see Alice dreaming of being Amanda Kruger who get stuck in room and get raped by 100 Manics then she being rushed to hospital but then she not longer the pregnant lady but then she Amanda giving birth to Freddy again br br Alice and Dan are the only two people to return from the 4th movie and then have gotten some new Friends its no long before Freddy start to kill again I did like the first dead it okay not as good as the other deaths or dreams br br Freddy himself didn t seem to be Scary in this movie at all the nightmare were just boring really they were not scary or creepy at all br br Acting in movies was okay for a 5th movie in the series but overall I think this movie was really Dull Still not worst movie of the series Freddy Dead is the worst br br 4 10
When you look back at another bad Nightmare sequel like Freddy s Revenge you have to at least give it some credit for trying something new And although The Dream Child is more enjoyable it offers absolutely nothing new to the series Yes there s the creative deaths as usual like a kid becoming part of a comic book and facing Super Freddy but even scenes like that aren t used to their full potential and the parts without Freddy are just boring br br This marked the official death of scariness to the series Freddy seems to be the comedic relief now but to what br br My Rating 4 10
The only thing that prevented this flick from being a total disaster were a couple of interesting stylish touches br br Moderate Spoiler Alert Death by comic is a bit derivative of a scene in Twilight Zone The Movie which delivers death by cartoon Still this was handled nicely especially watching the ink bleed and the color being sapped out br br Additionally there is one other good scene with a demon motorcycle br br Having said that I was glad I got the DVD cheap at a store going out of business sale because this was pretty awful I bought Soul Survivors at the same time and both movies were similarly annoying with the constant realizations that you have been watching a dream However where Soul Survivors has nothing to redeem it or have it make any sense this at least had a couple of stylish notes referred to above br br Interestingly the DVD lets you go to the 8 nightmares where something actually happens which is the only way to watch this The scripting between the creative gore moments is rather unbearable br br 3 out of 10
After the success of Part 4 another sequel was a natural move However they should have stopped it before it began Alice having survived Part 4 finds herself pregnant and it seems Freddy is using her unborn child to get at his victims which of course are Alice s friends Strange Nightmare movie very heavy on religious imagery and bad acting The special effects are good but the movie itself is not
A Nightmare on Elm Street The Dream Child the fifth installment in the Nightmare on Elm Street series and the worst sequel ever in the series even worse than A Nightmare on Elm Street 2 I was lucky enough to get the Nightmare on Elm Street DVD box set for my birthday and I watched all the sequels The dream child was the worst without a doubt I was surprised too since they were doing so well with the last two sequels But I guess they just lost the charm the story was just ridicules and I wasn t happy with where it went Alice just became more annoying she s not Nancy or Kirsten so her carrying this film on her own didn t work for me Freddy is also loosing his scare this was just getting a bit silly br br Alice is back and she s carrying a child she couldn t be happier with her life But Freddy is also back and he s not going to be too light on her since she defeated him so easily in the fourth movie But anyways he wants her child and to be born into the world again Did you ever wonder if Freddy had parents too Well that s what A Nightmare on Elm Street The Dream Child investigates and Alice soon finds out what Freddy s childhood was like and that maybe that s the one thing that can defeat him br br A Nightmare on Elm Street The Dream Child is just all in all a bad movie and an insult to the series I don t think anyone could be happy with this sequel Just the story was really silly I mean it could have possibly worked but once again it was just executed the wrong way I know that if you re looking to see the sequels for the Nightmare on Elm Street series you should watch it but I really wouldn t recommend it it s not worth it at least in my opinion br br 3 10
This is crap utter crap I cannot believe any company could even get people to work on a film like this Full Moon has a number of awful films but this has got to be the worst First off the plot doesn t exist It s odd It s like they took an idea for the story and kind of never really got around to developing it They seemed to have just wasted a lot of time filming outside shots while the two heroes drove around in the desert and Bradbury talks nonsense for about 10 minutes There were two scenes in the movie when Dez and Dazzy are driving and when Dez and Bradbury are driving where it just went on and on and on it was almost like 2 music videos in the place where there should have been some dialog or action They just drove for about 5 minutes with nothing but music and shots of the surrounding landscape br br Next we come to the acting which is simply horrible First off the girl who plays Dazzy is just a beast She is so scary looking I wanted to look away when she was on screen Horrible casting Then you have the guy who played Dez who couldn t act if his life depended on it His crying is actually funny and his madman antics are even funnier The guy who plays the desk clerk at the hotel is just as bad as is the guy who plays Bradbury There was no acting that deserves any recognition in this movie whatsoever br br The makeup effects hmmm can anyone say pathetic The effects were so fake they were laughable The crazy little robot looking catepillar thing grabs onto someone they cut away and when they come back the guy has a completely fake looking flesh wound Nice Did they run out of money on the makeup budget or what I must say the druggie chick who is in the one girl s apartment nice makeup there too I think they were going for a drugged look and I think she was supposed to have a black guy but it looked more like cheap zombie makeup for halloween br br This movie is just horrible from the start The story is stupid and very very unoriginal the direction looks as tho it was performed by a 10 year old the acting is the lowest of the low and so on STAY AWAY from this movie at all costs It s only 70 minutes long in the first place and atleast 20 minutes of that is taken up by either music and no dialog or the character sitting around in the hotel Do not waste your time on this piece of garbage
Before the Internet this movie could never have been made but the idea that the Web is full of evil is the idea behind it Unfortunately thats all it was the generally opinion that nowadays the Web in the wring hands can create as much chaos as anything in real life Since the late 90s somebody found out that you could create a virus which would disable a computer The point Just to do something plain evil by remote control so its the cyber equivalent of robbery with violence Which is basically what spam is without the violence its conning you into parting with your money and has been going so long its a wonder anybody takes any notice of it nowadays so they get cleverer and use real names as doing something illegal isn t a priority We see the Internet get worse by the week the social networking sites or chat room which lead to evil and the child porn sites which ARE illegal So the idea of a movie which invites people to click a name is just the same old thing there actually IS a site called Horrorvision which is a porn site but this one KILLS the people who enter its portals The story though is so disjointed its boring with it and comes to no conclusion The definitive movie on this theme of destroying an Internet Service Provider has yet to be made but clearly many DO need destroying as they won t be shut down when there s money to be made Calling this a horror film is rather misleading as it bores not frightens
save your money i have been a fan of fullmoon productions for a long time and i have never seen them make a movie as bad as this the casting is terrible the story is even worse and the special affects are worse than any movie iv e seen sence the 80 s this movie is so bad i cant even suggest renting it
At first look of the plot tagline I figured it could have been a decent film Could I have ever been more wrong The beginning of the film makes it look like a bunch of freaks got together and decided to make a low budget film For the first 10 minutes you don t notice the cheesy acting horrible sound and god awful special effects but then it gets worse Just about 20 minutes into it I was asking myself What was the plot again I could only ask that question when I wasn t busted out laughing from the sheer lameness of this film The main actor has one setting for emotions and he sticks to it throughout the entire film even though he was supposed to go through love and hate and everything in between The flashback scene almost made me vomit because it made me re live one extra minute of footage from earlier in the movie Now we hit the middle of the film where they are obviously trying to rip off Morpheus from The Matrix although he is doing just a horrible job The actor s talking about Star Wars and fortune cookie phrases is almost unbearable Now at the end of the movie you don t realize that it s the end of the movie because you actually think the plot is finally developing The Morpheus character dies the ONLY good thing about the movie He utters a couple words and the credits roll What is this No plot bad acting cheesy everything it couldn t get any worse Please if you value human decency DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE
Decent enough with some stylish imagery however the tiny budget hampers things br br I also get the impression they were trying to shock you with some of the graphic weirdo perv website stuff br br if you like anime in particular stuff like cyber city and the AD police then this might up your street br br but basically its low budget matrix cash in however not totally devoid of its own style br br Great soundtrack by some unheard of grunge punk post grunge bands Worth checking out if only for the soundtrack
I found Horrorvision almost unwatchable While only 70 minutes in length I still found myself hitting the fast forward button again and again The acting was of the if I scream and say k a lot I m intense school And the story was at best a scenario that had yet to be fleshed out br br While I never go to Full Moon for great film making I have never seen them produce as bad a piece of junk as this
If this guy can make a movie then I sure as hell can make one too br br In fact if you hire me to make a movie for you I promise to do the following br br 1 I will add more naked women This movie had none I think cheesy B class horror movies are only rented because of their traditional exploitation of the female body I wouldn t want to let my viewers down br br 2 I will refrain from making too many scenes where the hero wakes up to find out it s only a dream I think HorrorVision had about 4 of these scenes And considering the movie was only like an hour long the dream to movie length ratio was quite high And if I do decide to do a dream sequence I will make sure that the person wakes up without clothes on I mean who sleeps in leather pants br br 3 I will not rip off any movies like Star Wars or the Matrix because I will know that my budget is small and I will not want to mask my contempt for big budget Hollywood movies by adding satirical references about them in mine br br 4 And finally I will not mix modern technology with the undead I mean a palm pilot can only be so scary at least they turned it into an evil rolly polly monster before the screen blew up or something br br So if you are looking for the above qualities in your next horror production count on me wanna b movie director extraordinaire
I am not from America and I know what Wife Swap is When a show came out of that name I was thrilled to see some cool glamorized sexual moments from the program But what I got was a real sucking stupidity I was misjudged by its title name it has no adult contents no nudity not even vulgar dialogues broad casted threw Hallmark channel and I think they edited mute out such contents to make it neat br br A show which gives a picture of current American western family state overweight chubby peoples polluted teenagers and their sucking family goings In each episode two wives two mothers more correctly were chosen to live in each others home and re changes each others family routine with their new own rule Sometimes its turns out to be good or more evenly bad On the ending section each mothers are brought back with their husband and try to conclude what they did to each families past days It s the sucking portion of the program were each contenders fights for their rights I was sucked to see all of these instead of seeing some cool adult sex stuff I mean who make this program more than that who gave the name Wife Swap its better to be called as Mother Swap All in all it corrupts all the great things the real Wife Swap stands for br br Wife Swap Average Sucking Reality Show
No doubt Frank Sinatra was a talented actor as well as a talented singer After all very few actors nowadays can get a scene just right in one take and that was pretty much Sinatra s modus operandi on set br br I feel that as the 1960 s wore on the quality of the man s films really started to tank The Tony Rome detective series was nothing short of trying to compete with Dean Martin s Matt Helm series which came out at the same time Perhaps even a James Bond competition but nothing really worked for Frank during these years His personal life in shambles his music fading out Sinatra appeared more like a throwback to the 1950 s The last great Sinatra film of this period was probably Von Ryan s Express in 1965
Lady in Cement PI spoof with ole Blue Eyes Frank Sinatra is a shamus on a houseboat in Miami in this rarely funny comedy Burdened by an annoying and repetitious Hugo Montenegro score and bunch of misfiring punchlines this 1968 flick just never rises above slightly too bawdy to be on TV made for television movie status Dan Blocker is effective in the Mike Mazurski Ted De Corsia big galoot role and Raquel Welch should thank her personal trainer The only thing that makes the DVD worth keeping or seeing is the collection of cheesy trailers for Welch flicks like Bandolero Fantastic Voyage Mother Jugs Speed and Myra Breckinridge Even if you get the DVD skip the predictable movie and go for the trailer library in the special features Besides tons of mysoginistic asides Sinatra lisps the homosexual owners of the local Go Go bar A relic that needs to be put back in the time capsule D
Detective Tony Rome Frank Sinatra returns to the screen after his self titled debut this time it s a film that s played for erm laughs While on a diving trip Rome finds the body of a blonde beauty at the bottom of the sea her feet as you might expect encased in cement Rome immediately on the case after being hired by man mountain Waldo Gronsky Rome finds himself immediately at risk as he has to investigate some mafia types who turn the tables on him and he is himself found to be the main suspect he must now go on the run and hope to solve the case alone The portly Sinatra tries hard to sell us the lame jokes and make us believe he is a good detective oh and not to mention being sexually attractive to the foxy Raquel Welch but he fails miserably in this ham fisted vanity project The frankly laughable denouement that surrounds every female is quite astounding every woman in the film is a dither head who likes bending over is front of the camera Director Douglas of course obliges in zooming in on the cracks of their asses each time as they flex their posterior muscles There s even a ridiculously campy gay character that beggars belief this was a film made by real men for real men to reaffirm their own flagging sexuality it s a shameful shambles
Terrible film with Frank Sinatra as Tony Rome Here he gets involved with a dead woman below the sea br br Rome is soon hired to find out what happened to a woman Naturally it s the woman below the sea Her room mate Lainie Kazan soon winds up dead on the floor br br An aging Richard Conte plays a police officer and friend of Rome When a local club owner gets killed the blame falls on Rome and there becomes an interesting chase scene That s how bad this picture is if you have to depend on a chase scene to supply the action br br Raquel Welch plays the beauty up to her neck in intrigue Her acting leads a lot to be desired br br Martin Gabel is a retired hoodlum whose son is trying to outdo him br br By the film s end you don t know why the girl was murdered Don t even bother to ask
The Lady in Cement is a veritable course on social anthropology of the late 60 s The writing not the acting is at center stage Did I say pure camp Prepare to be offended if you are female or gay Broad and dame are standard terms and gay baiting and bashing are represented for what they were in the day camp wise Most of the lines are tossed off although there are wonderful performances by a very few outstanding character actors The action scenes are mundane but it is fun to see Dan Blocker play a tough guy who likes bashing toughs And Lanie Kazan and Racquel Welsh are at the voluptuous peak of their careers Amazing to note they were both 28 years old and Mr Sinatra was 53 The musical score wait was there a score Well you get the point Watch it with friends who want a good laugh it s full of them
Though not a fan of Sam Rockwell I was surprised when I saw his name in the credits in the opening of Joshua Heck I wasn t even aware he was in Joshua until I started the movie So it goes without saying I was watching the movie on the basis of the movie not the leads A sort of Rosemary s Baby The Omen or any other demonic kid movie Joshua was billed Unfortunately it fell flat Slow incredibly slow and flat Yet I continued on to see how this would all resolve hoping beyond belief the ending climax would shed some light on the subject Okay I admit it did a wee bit but what a stale closing And what a low low budget movie or at least that s how they designed it A person falls you don t see the drop you see someone lying down in what appears to be blood A person gets hit by a cab you don t see it you see someone complaining holding a bike up I m not sure if this is called style or laziness or simply lack of funds for special effects We have a rich family with a crazy mom a workaholic father attempting to balance everything a kid Joshua who may may not be the antichrist and a new born baby girl who cries a lot She cries as much as we see how many days she s alive and what was that about Are there rats above or is it Joshua Is his mother nuts Is Joshua crazy Is he merely jealous of the newcomer to the family Is he going to grow up to be Michael Myers Or does he drive his family to the brink I don t think so They were nuts prior and no so called acting could make me believe otherwise Unfortunately barely any questions were answered barely any open doors shut I m sure that might have been the idea but for Pete s sake give me something Anything There are plenty better kid gone wild movies to explore Joshua s more like the Mini Me of the antichrist
I did not enjoy the film Joshua at all Perhaps it is because I saw another much better similar film titled Orphan 2 days prior but perhaps it s really just because this film was not very good I am going with the ladder Sure the plot of an evil child is not exactly original but that doesn t mean the film could not succeed It could have been suspenseful and entertaining and chilling but instead it was slow building boring uneventful and really didn t leave me thinking anything more than that wasn t very good when it was all over br br At the end Joshua s motivations are revealed I won t give that away but the reality is that he didn t really accomplish his goals since despite Vera Farmiga as his mother Abby disappearing about 3 4th through the movie all arrows point to her returning home soon She was committed to a mental institution because she was losing her mind but then Joshua s Father Her husband was accused of tampering with her medication which tells the audience that the institution realized that she was indeed not mentally ill but rather was being dosed medically So shouldn t she be coming home soon Won t Joshua have failed Won t his Mother be living with him and his sister and possibly his Father soon I question the Father since his future is left open ended br br At the end of the day I didn t care about the characters The evil demon child Joshua wasn t really scary The storyline moved slowly and when it picked up it was still boring Suspense fell flat every single time When it was over I couldn t believe I had sat through the whole thing br br 4 10 just because the acting was good from the parents especially Vera Farmiga as the Mother but if you want to see a movie about an evil child go see Orphan Now that s a movie that took an unoriginal concept and created a brilliant movie
This movie Joshua is extremely disturbing and downright pointless It actually makes me shudder to think there are people who would enjoy watching it Without giving away the story it is about a young boy s reaction to his newborn sister and that is just the tip of the iceberg During the entirety of this movie the viewer is subjected to some of the most unsettling child behavior imaginable Adding insult to injury by the end of this movie there is absolutely no real outcome except the fruition of pure evil at the hands of a child no less who outsmarted a whole group of dumb adults There is no redemption no justice served and a whole group of adults who are not smart enough to see what is going on around them Frankly I did not enjoy watching this movie It was extremely unsettling Even for those who might enjoy horror movies this movie could be too much Despite the fact this movie was well acted the story itself is so disturbing that watching it was equivalent to a 90 minute wait in a dentist s waiting room in anticipation of some painful dental procedure
The acting in the film is really well done honestly but the movie is so slow and so boring as soon as it gets interesting everything slows to a major halt I am glad to see Sam Rockwell in this he did a great job so did the other actors as I mentioned but man this is one of the worst dragged out films I have ever seen Now maybe in a short film form this movie would be good but other than that avoid it This film has so much filler it makes a Twinkie cake jealous br br I never ever walk out on films but watching this one at home with family I walked out Yeah it was that boring Apparently my comment doesn t have enough lines to post so here s some more filler I guess I was inspired by the movie I just watched
I watched the whole movie waiting and waiting for something to actually happen Maybe it s my fault for expecting evil and horror instead of psychology Is it a weird re telling of the Oedipal myth I want to kill my father and mother and marry my uncle and compose musical theater with him I didn t understand why certain plot elements were even present why was the construction upstairs why was there that big stairwell with a perfect spot for someone to fall to their doom if no one was actually going to do so why have the scenes at all with the father at work why have such a nice kitchen if you re only going to eat takeout why would the boy want to be baptized and the parents be the ones to resist instead of the other way around I see lots of good reviews for this movie has my taste been corrupted by going up with 70s b movies and old sci fi flicks
I gave this more than a 1 because I did think there were some moral lessons in this story and it provoked some thought and comment from my wife and I The acting and the dialogue were mediocre and I must confess I came out feeling like I had been beaten over the head with the God this God that and Christ is our saviour stuff The movie and the story line did not need it If as I am you are a recovering Catholic or Christian avoid this one it will make you nauseous The movie did a good job of demonstrating the thin line between being a good citizen and how someone could become a potential stalker focused on what might have been
I was interested in seeing this movie because I knew it was Christian based The director had a good idea intentions when making this movie but it could have been better I can understand why someone would still have feelings for who they believe is the greatest love of their life However I didn t understand why the director made his friends so insensitive mean and rude The main character kept apologizing to his friends when they were the ones mean to him They weren t understanding at all and they used God as a reason to explain their behaviors The main character nor anyone else didn t know if the ex girlfriend was divorced still married etc but they were against him resolving old feelings that needed to be dealt with His friends were suppose to be Christians and should have been portrayed as being supportive whether they agreed with his decision or not So many times we do things in life where we don t apologize to those we have hurt in the past and when he was trying to do this they were all against him The ironic part was his new female friend accused him of having stalking behavior for simply looking up an old friend when she did a really odd thing to get a hold of his name address and phone number she seemed to be the stalker she didn t seem like a friend at all but was only looking out for herself God is love and I think God wants people to be with the person they were meant to be with and i feel the movie did a terrible injustice by making it seem like God doesn t care about true love only that you stay with someone you made a bad choice with We all make mistakes it s all about what steps you take to make amends Like I said the movie had potential but I was tired of the one sided point of view being constantly repeated and jammed down the viewers throat by his so called well meaning friends This movie didn t hold true to the Christian belief of love but i give it a C for its effort
Dave is going through a divorce and his mind wanders back to his first love Wanders is probably not the word I should say he fixates on the past girlfriend He recalls to the day when the relationship ended The dream sequences only lack the hazy transitions He fondly recalls their favorite songs and places they went I m not a counselor but maybe this had something to do with the failed marriage Dave goes to a support group and meets up with a lady half his age also divorced who instead of being turned off by his creepiness starts to become interested in him Did I mention how creepy Dave is He sometimes refers to himself in the third person He doesn t move his arms when he walks either It s just weird Too make a long story short Dave plots to hunt down Mary the old gal friend and kill her err I mean confront her He does so Which was really creepy He believes her to be married yet he STILL flies half way across the country to meet her He stakes out her house to make sure she is alone before he drops in on her He has an awkward conversation with her that ends with his sharing the gospel of Christ in about 10 words or less and flies back to the new young girlfriend We enjoyed the movie mostly for unintentional comedic value I am still entertaining the wife with my Dave impressions I heard another Dave Mary song
From everything I d read about the movie I was excited to support a film with a Christian theme Everything about the movie was very unprofessionally done Especially the writing Without good writing a movie doesn t have a chance The writer director said in an interview that he didn t want to give away how the title relates to the story Believe me it was NO big surprise I kept waiting for the teenage young adult back story to unfold but it never did As someone who has gone through a divorce I was very disappointed This movie would have been NO comfort to me when I first went through the emotional turmoil that divorce can bring to your life as a Christian

Except for the Brady Variety Hour this was some of the hokiest television I ve seen in a while The video production qualities weren t too bad but the overall look and feel were unmistakeably early 80 s And Marie Osmond looks like she did battle with the Avon Lady and lost big time WAY too much eyeliner br br It was kind of embarrassing to watch veterans Danny Kaye and Eric Severeid take part in this Even more interesting was watching Alex Haley talk about the African Pavillion in World Showcase that would be opening in about a year br br As of this writing it is 17 years later and it hasn t opened yet Unless you count Disney s Animal Kingdom All in all though for all the shortcomings this still an interesting visual piece of Disney history
This may be the worst show I ve ever seen Aside from the tastelessness of having a sitcom about Hitler it just isn t funny or entertaining in any way It is very similar to a 1950 s sitcom in its cornball humor and contrived situations but while it can be well done like in I Love Lucy it s just not funny here I think the show was based around the novelty look it s Hitler as a bumbling sitcom figure but it just fell flat in every regard The guy playing Hitler is so hammy that its hard to sit through that alone I wonder what could have possibly made the network think this was a good idea to air I thought America had some tasteless show but the Brits had us beat this time America would never air a sitcom about Hitler although we did have that show about Lincoln s slave The Secret Diary of Desmond Pfeiffer Chances are you ll probably never see this show since it only aired one episode and will probably never be released on DVD
I wonder who was responsible for this mess The jokes wouldn t have worked for gilligan s island If this had gone to series would there have been jokes about Auschwitz or would Eva have to replace her oven only to have Adolf suggest the kind that seats 50 Another post compared this show to I love Lucy The problem with this is that Lucille Ball was a genius at physical comedy and bizarre situations and this mess was just plain badly done and an insult to my intelligence br br After the damage the Nazi s did to England and the number of people they killed I would think the very concept of a comedy about Hitler would seem repugnant and most normal people would have killed this concept before any episodes were produced
Wow You guys are way too nice Corny Corny Corny That is how I feel about that film It started well with a good idea A guy Edward Asner escape from Jail dressed as Santa a bunch of kids find him and believes his the real Santa so the Fake Santa enlist the children to help him find a bag of stolen money the film is like a Christmas version of Whistle down the wind The movie start well but gradually it becomes Cheesier and Cheesier to the point that at the end it becomes ridiculous and you just cant take this film seriously For example you get the Scrooge type character called Sumner Rene Auberjonois who s a total Douchebag who treat his young son like a pile a rubbish he treat his son so bad that he don t even buy him decent clothes the poor kid wears Jeans with Holes in it but a 45 second scene with Fake Santa visiting Sumner and by the end of the film you get the guy all happy singing Christmas Carol and giving his neglected son a hug yep that is how Corny it is I m all for feel good movie especially during Christmas and I am a big fan of seasonal TV movie but this one is way too over the top for me it is a shame because it started well but the second half of the movie is trowing a supernatural element to the film that just don t match with the rest of it It s not totally bad there are some solid acting especially from the children but there are plenty of better Christmas film around
SPOILERS KHAMOSH is totally unrealistic lacks a plot and was basically only made to see stars portray themselves The most suspenseful scene in the movie was when Shabana Azmi is in the shower and then we see her TV playing the shower scene from PSYCHO This movie actually expected users to believe that Naseeruddin Shah s character has a good enough memory to remember where certain shots were fired and how many br br SPOILER BEGINS br br At the end the killer spills his guts to Shabana Azmi long enough to allow Naseeruddin Shah s character to run up and shoot him br br SPOILER ENDS br br It is a little humorous only a little in the beginning to hear the director and cast members throwing insults at each other and hearing Shabana Azmi exclaim Oh sh t br br Overall a baaaaaaaaaaad movie br br Rating out of 2 out of 10
With their no holds bar cruel offensive humor sure enough to offended anyone you would sure think this would be a laugh riot wrong Worest movie since Open water Don t be to surprised if you completely miss this movie upon release date as I m sure it wont do very good at all at the box office This movie had a lot of Potential but fell to little to short No enough character development awkward actors and The upside of this movie was nudity Boobs Amazing If I had to see this movie again I myself would go POSTAl
Today I wrote this review in anger at Uwe Boll and Hollywood br br Hollywood has produced movies based on one of the darkest days of our nation 911 changed everything It changed our perception of security It changed our understanding of the evil of man and humanity Most importantly and devastatingly it changed our world br br However I can t not stress how utterly repulsed disillusioned and angry I am at the careless blatant ignorance of Hollywood seeking to make a lucrative profit out of death and destruction This film and those like it are bound to cause controversy amid word of mouth among moviegoers and critics alike most surely to be echoed by the mainstream press Hollywood has sunk to a new low Even lower than the low down bastards who perpetrated the most barbaric acts of savagery and unrelenting cruelty Behind it all is Uwe Boll I am very angry at this movie How dare they disrespect the memories of families of those lost How dare they mock the lives of the brave men and women who risked their lives to save those trapped in the doomed towers on that fateful day of infamy How dare they try to satirize and at the same time capitalize on a national tragedy in the mist of a mourning and weary post 911 world How dare they br br To those who have the gall to even think of seeing this morally appalling travesty I say this with a heavy heart with all my strength Remember Think back to that day and ask yourself whether or not you are a sane and moral person Think back to that day ask yourself whether or not this film is a disgrace and dishonor to the lives lost on that day Think back to that day of the outcry of families of loved ones Think back to that day of the lives lost on those two planes Think back to the further carnage it caused following the attacks br br Ask yourself if you have a soul br br Think Remember Respect the memories of the lives lost on 911 by not seeing this film at all
I watched this movie at a Sneak Preview screening and I m glad I didn t pay for it This movie is just disgusting Its full of dick and fart jokes and takes no pride in the action sequences such as the shootout in Little Germany I made a little list of things I enjoyed in the movie and a lot of which I didn t agree of br br 1 Dave Foley s penis 2 The fart jokes 3 The Poop jokes 4 The Dude was a pussy 5 No Gary Coleman 6 The Talibans 7 Again making fun of Bush WE GET IT HE S AN IDIOT move on 8 The Dude has blonde hair 9 The Plot 10 The killing of minors 11 Uwe Boll was in it 12 Most of the cast were just outrages and out there br br Now the few good ones br br 1 The Dude uses a cat as a silencer like in the game 2 Lots of action 3 Crotchy made a return and a cameo of the maker of Postal 4 Uhm I didn t have to pay for it 5 There are a few what the ef moments br br Boll did it again He made another crappy game into movie adaption Kudos to you Mr Boll 2 10
If I could i would give ZERO stars for this one but unfortunately i have to give one br br There is no single scene I could laugh about but the game didn t make me laugh either So if you re some ill retarded folk go to your local cinema watch this movie and give it 10 stars like some people here already did br br but for me in a movie where children are shot dead to achieve humor good taste goes over the edge this was the third time i wasted my time to see a Boll movie and it was definitely my last br br 0 10 i m ashamed of being from the same country as Uwe Boll br br PLEASE PLEASE KEEP HIM FROM MAKING MORE MOVIES
I saw this movie at the Edmonton International Film Festival with the great Dr Uwe Boll in attendance br br The film is simply put very very bad And no not in the usual Uwe Boll so bad it s actually entertaining way but just plain bad The plot concerns a man who leads a terrible life because of a past criminal record apparently can t get a job and with an awful 900 pound cheating wife This man turns to his cult leader uncle in a plan to steal a truck load of toys that contain the bird flu virus Al Qaeda also has designs on stealing the toys and what follows is just under two hours of completely incomprehensible sex and violence br br The acting is awful except for Dave Foley who really tries despite it all the jokes never rise above children being shot in the chest in slow motion and people taking a poo It s supposed to be satire but I m not sure of what br br Think Airplane but done by the creators of South Park and without any jokes
Okay this is gona be short and sweet review Something the movie should have taken a practice ina nd made its life shorter and sweeter than it was br br This movie is There s a good reason there was a petition with over 40 000 signatures ALL demanding Uwe Boll stop making movies from franchises people liked Blood Rayne being a biggie there br br The jokes are good if you ve never heard them a THOUSAND times before THe acting is descent but u can really only blame the script for that I even a few moments wonder if they re even using a script br br The movie has little to NOTHING to do with the original games HELLO if you ve played the games u know the main character has no real motivation outside homicidal urges like mass murder because he stubbed his toe or simular There s way too much story for such a stupid movie like I said I WOULDN T even steal this movie ANd for the person who says this is Funniest movie of 2007 need to take a look around the news is better than this
I m not going to waste my time writing an essay and waste your time I would like to say however that all those who are uptight about this movie even being made are being totally ridiculous Johnnymacbest you can t play that card and I mean the nationalism patriotic card to make people not watch this movie this is a movie that expresses its free will in this country oh yea i played that card even though the director is German and deserves a slap on the wrist every time he reaches for a camera but the world is full of controversy and its the same thing you ve heard before like the GTA controversy It s a comedy laugh and be disgusted not disgusted all together its dark humor and obviously you don t have the heart to take it the past is past yes people remember those who were lost but its time to move on that was 7 years ago You can still watch this movie and have good moral values br br Besides I m insane and who needs a soul
Uwe Boll has done the impossible create a game adaptation that stays at least somewhat true to the game he has turned a game full of antisocial and offensive content into a movie full of antisocial and offensive content So as an adaptation it s a success br br Unfortunately it s still Uwe Boll we are dealing with here so don t expect the movie to be actually any good while it does have it s moment Postal wears out his welcome very fast and becomes a pain to sit through br br At its core Postal is a satire on the United States as done by a twelve year old kid Boll seems to think that offensiveness is linearly proportional to comedic value the more offensive the funnier and the more exaggerated the funnier This results in a movie that sets new levels of tastelessness while being extremely hit and miss Yes some gags do work but it seems to be pure luck High points include the director satirizing himself and people getting hit very violently by trucks and other vehicles Low points include well pretty much everything else br br After the initial surprise wears off Postal simply becomes a bore to watch Yes there is a good joke every and good point ten minutes but everything else consists of hordes of annoying characters shooting and chasing each other all over the place for what seems to be an eternity br br This probably would have worked as a short movie but it s just not enough content for something that lasts over 90 minutes although it feels twice as long There are nice ideas and nice tries but they get hopelessly lost in endless and pointless action scenes and content that is offensive just for the sake of it 4 10
Blood of the Sacred Blood of the Damned is the third installment of the Gabriel Knight games a series of adventure games about the roguish writer paranormal detective Gabriel Knight Gabriel and his companion Grace have been asked by Prince James of Albany to investigate a series of mysterious attacks by so called night visitors When the son of Prince James is kidnapped Gabriel pursues the night visitors to Rennes le Château where he begins piecing together a mystery relating to the Holy Grail br br Despite the marketing this game is not about vampires Vampires have a token appearance in the game but never command center stage as did the voodoo hounfor in Sins of the Fathers or the werewolves in The Beast Within Gabriel and Grace make no attempt to uncover the true nature of vampires or to research lore on vampires Although the vampires do murder three people during the course of the game their victims are chosen at random and have nothing to do with the main plot br br A large part of the charm of the first two Gabriel Knight installments was in the relationships which Gabriel formed with the villains Through these relationships the player could not help but sympathize with the villain and thus the villain was transformed into more of a human and less of a monster However in Blood of the Sacred Gabriel s only interaction with the villain is through a single cheesy interview which does nothing to endear the villain to the player br br The roles that Gabriel and Grace play in this mystery are fairly futile Gabriel spends his time snooping into the identities of members of a treasure hunter tour group staying at his hotel but what he uncovers amounts to nothing more than a red herring Grace spends her time researching the mystery of Rennes le Château but all her research is rendered superfluous by the presence of a perplexing ally who has known the answer to this mystery for centuries br br The actions of this perplexing ally and his polar opposite the vampire leader are insupportable The ally leaves hints about the mystery of Rennes le Château in broad daylight and expects Grace and not the other treasure hunters from the tour group to find them However he could have revealed the mystery to Grace in its entirety on day 1 instead of putting the kidnapped child at risk for an additional 48 hours And in the end he simply tells Grace the mystery in its entirety anyway br br Meanwhile the vampire leader fails to achieve the goals of centuries of scheming because he chooses to refrain from action for two days after the kidnapping of the child The only reason given for his decision to delay action is that he wants to savor his victory br br The game would have been much better had it been purely focused on the Holy Grail The kidnapping and vampires should have been omitted replaced with a race against the Vatican to uncover the mystery of Rennes le Château Since Gabriel is portrayed more than once as reluctantly Catholic this conflict would have had many opportunities for character development br br All in all the game was a disappointing installment in the series despite an improved interface and the return of Tim Curry as the voice of Gabriel Knight
SPOILERS I m always surprised at how many people gave this game good reviews It was awful The script and voice acting alone ruined it Gabriel and Grace are the most unlikeable characters in the game You almost pray for their deaths And worst of all there are less vampires in this game than there were werewolves in The Beast Within br br The lack of real vampires was incredibly disappointing If you re expecting some kind of Anne Rice style vampire story forget it This game s story has very little to do with vampires You won t even see any till about the very end and even then you won t get to fight them br br The story has radical and pretty much blasphemous views of Christianity I m amazed it got off the drawing board I m not even Christian and I found it offensive Mostly the story centers around a search for The Holy Grail and buried treasure The kidnapping of a royal baby which should have been the focus really gets pushed aside There is no sense of urgency for Gabriel to find the baby In fact he almost never asks anyone about the baby after the first few time blocks br br The graphics are pretty bad The characters move about at a snail s pace even on the best of systems They are chunky and outdated And it s hard to go from the FMV of The Beast Within to this horrible game engine for Blood of the Sacred br br The relationship between Gabriel and Grace takes an awful turn too I really don t know why it was so horribly rushed but they do sleep together And it s not fun Gabriel spends most of the game telling his best friend Mosely how he thinks of Grace as more of a sister and he doesn t think she s the one for him And he seems really grossed out that they slept together But he s so unlikeable throughout the game that you almost don t even care at that point His dialogue was the worst in the game And he was constantly making stupid sexual innuendos at anything female the entire game By the end of the game Grace leaves him with what appears to be a Dear John letter I guess she was as fed up with him as most of the players were br br I found the story to be annoying and boring I was expecting to play a story of a royal baby who was kidnapped by vampires And I was expecting to get to see and fight vampires maybe even have Gabriel or Grace turn into one But no Instead the story focused on the author s warped vision of Christianity What a shame Here they had the elements for a great adventure and instead we got this br br For me the only interesting parts of the game were actually at the very end We do get a few action style puzzles at the end But it wasn t worth suffering through the entire game to get to them br br I can t really recommend this game I had gotten it back when it came out years ago and I hated the game engine so much that I shelved it for years I only recently dusted it off to see what I d been missing And now I m very sorry that I did My favorite characters were ruined I hope there will be a fourth game just to redeem the series And I hope they get it right next time It would be a terrible shame to end the series with this installment
Pier Paolo Pasolini or Pee pee pee as I prefer to call him due to his love of showing male genitals is perhaps THE most overrated European Marxist director and they are thick on the ground How anyone can see art in this messy cheap sex romp concoction is beyond me Some of the stories here could have come straight out of a soft core porn film and I am not even so much referring to the nudity but the simplistic and banal often pointless stories Anyone who enjoyed this relatively watchable but dumb oddity should really sink his teeth into the Der Schulmaedchenreport soft porn German 70s movie series because that s what Decameron looks like to me br br Besides the movie is sloppy on nearly all levels from start to finish br br 1 Editing An example at 1 hour 15 minutes 45 seconds there is a chasing scene that is put quite clearly in the wrong place It was supposed to be placed about a minute later but I guess that Pasolini must have hired boozed up editors who have little time for the fine details of movie making Pee pee pee s fans would probably counter this by saying that it was placed there intentionally which I very much doubt Besides even if that were true that would be even worse because that story gains absolutely nothing by making it harder to follow This isn t exactly Eraserhead or one of Tarantino s broken form films br br 2 Acting Vey sloppy Triple Pee s fans all 8 of them proudly declare how 3P O uses real people instead of actors Aren t actors people Or are they Martians Sure many actors have sub par IQs but does that mean we should treat them with contempt Other directors have used amateurs and succeeded such as Alan Parker or De Niro so why are PPP s amateurs so utterly awful in his movies The answer is once again appalling sloppiness Pasolini is sloppy in everything and that includes trying to get as much out of his toothless amateurs as he can He is a lazy director an IMperfectionist if you like The anti Kubrick I suppose Pee pee pee s principal goal when casting must have been to find as many toothless old people as possible and young men that are to his liking In Pasolini s world there is a simple formula lack of teeth strange face realism It s all well and fine to have them toothless but at least try to eke out some at least semi decent performances out of these inexperienced neo thespians otherwise you re an amateur yourself an amateur director in Pasolini s case Whether 3P 0 wasn t capable of this feat or simply didn t care doesn t change anything Who knows maybe he didn t even notice the awful acting br br 3 Audio The synchronization If 3P 0 felt that microphones are too much of a hassle when filming a movie then he ought to have at least made a concerted effort in post production i e getting all these bum actors to say their lines on cue in the studio so that we the viewers wouldn t have to watch mouths move while the elusive dialogue floats elsewhere in the movie br br 4 Lack of concept We have close to a dozen stories which aren t connected in any meaningful way Some are anti Church more on that later while some are merely sex yarns i e cheap male sometimes gay fantasies designed to titillate and nothing else The stories and characters are not amusing if at all on an intelligent level but on the basest level 10 year old kids can laugh here And there is nothing wrong with that but then don t call it exalted intellectual art br br 5 As a result of point 4 there is also a lack of logic in the order of the stories That goes without saying Pee pee pee could have arranged the order in any other way and we would have had the exact same movie This also means that you can feel free to start from the middle then go back to the beginning etc Decameron is like a bowl of spaghetti that way when you start eating it you can begin with any thread you want it makes no difference at all br br 6 The pointlessness of the stories resolutions Most stories end with a cheap gag joke i e some damn dumb punchline straight out of a porn comic book whereas some stories don t even have a conclusion they merely end Finito At best the stories are watchable semi anecdotes barely any deeper meaning there unless you find deep meanings in a porno There is of course nothing easier than looking for and finding meaning where there is an absence of it Hence even any hardcore porn film can be philosophized mused over endlessly It s easy and fun Try it oh ye 8 PPP fans br br As for the Church bashing Some viewers get all excited about his attack on Catholicism and what not In principal that s all well and fine after all I m an atheist myself but what those people ignore is the simple but essential fact that Pasolini was a Marxist It s like the pot calling the kettle black A Marxist criticizing the Church for hypocrisy and stupidity Where does he get the nerve Besides Pasolini wasn t an atheist hence his high and mighty and self righteous stance isn t justified After all Marxists are believers they merely substituted the accepted god with the idea of a Utopia which is merely another supernatural wishful thinking fantasy Hence I cannot get excited about PPP s anti religion antics br br This sophomoric humpdorama anthology ends with Pasolini saying rather pretentiously I wonder Why produce a work of art when it s nice just to dream about it He wasn t actually referring to this silly little movie as art was he In case he was the poor deluded man then I have to wonder why he didn t just leave it at dreaming and NOT make all those bad movies br br Wanna read my altered subtitles of Bergman movies E mail me
Although I am generally a proponent of the well made film I do not limit myself to films which escape those boundaries and more often than not I do enjoy and admire films that successfully break the rules And it is quite true that director Pasolini breaks the rules of established cinema But it is also my opinion that he does not break them successfully or to any actual point br br Pasolini s work is visually jarring but this is less a matter of what is actually on the screen than how it is filmed and the jumpiness of his films seem less a matter of artistic choice than the result of amateur cinematography This is true of DECAMERON Pasolini often preferred to use non actors and while many directors have done so with remarkable result under Pasolini s direction his non actors tend to remain non actors This is also true of DECAMERON Pasolini quite often includes images designed to shock offend or otherwise disconcert the audience Such elements can often be used with startling effect but in Pasolini s hands such elements seldom seem to actually contribute anything to the film This is also true of DECAMERON br br I have been given to understand there are many people who like even admire Pasolini s films Even so I have never actually met any of them and I have never been able to read anything about Pasolini or his works that made the reason for such liking or admiration comprehensible to me Judging him from his works alone I am of the opinion that he was essentially an amateurish director who did not break the rules so much by choice as by lack of skill and who was initially applauded by the intelligentsia of his day for existential boldness thereby simply confirming him in bad habits as a film maker I find his work tedious unimpressive and pretentious And this too is true of DECAMERON It is also sadly true of virtually every Pasolini film it has been my misfortune to endure
The tragedy is that this piece of rubbish was part of my curriculum while I was studying cinema So imagine how I was forced to watch it in complete Believe me going through hell is much much easier Our professor told us that this is some film but he never thought that we d disagree or assume the apposite I don t think that there is any gods on earth we re only humans so all the filmmakers therefore they CAN make mistakes bad movies Or very bad too The main problem wasn t that art by all means is susceptible to endless points of view but that a lot of people just don t get it that every single human got his own genuine taste his own opinion hence what I suppose it the greatest movie ever made can also be your worst one ever and how that is right both ways but how many people can understand this correctly So my professor believes in this movie and simply I don t However the only way to evaluate this thing is by measuring it by its original intent to show us different kinds of old folk stories or whatever to catch on this society s mentality imagination and nature To tell you the damn truth Mr Pier Paolo Pasolini as the scriptwriter and the director made it too unbearable to watch in the first place The movie is so UGLY I can t stand this so how about analyzing it then discovering the potential beauty in it It s beyond your mind hideousness and strangely not for the sake of the movie s case or anything it s for the sake of the unstable vision of Pasolini His work is so primitive to underdeveloped extent The deadly cinematic technique the effective sense of silliness and the incredible horribleness made everything obnoxious Look at the atrocious acting the unfruitful cinematography the awfully poor sets OH MY GOD I ve got the nausea already It can terminate your objectivity violently as watching this movie is one true pain like taking the wisdom tooth off by a blind doctor There are dreadful nightmares which could be more merciful than this So originally how to continue THAT just to review it fairly Actually you don t As this very movie doesn t treat you fair at all There is really memorable scene in here where some boys are peeing into the eye of the camera I m trying to connect some things like that with Pasolini s end as murdered
Though the title may suggest examples of the 10 commandments it is a definitely incorrect assumption This is an adaptation of 9 SEEMINGLY unrelated stories from Giovanni Bocaccio s 14th century Decameron story collection br br Set within a medieval Italian town s largely peasant population it is a diatribe on the reality of sex and its consequences within that world and time A realistic view of Life within this world it sometimes feels like a journey back in time br br Given the depicted human element of its time one can also see the more adventurous side of morality in its protagonists as well as the ironies of Life at times Or it may also be viewed as a general satire of the Catholic Church s rules br br Nothing terribly special but definitely interesting if one comes with no expectations or assumptions
Yeah I get Pasolini and his milieu but at the same time I feel his Decameron is largely overrated and more than a little disturbing Overrated because the supposed realism he introduces milling crowds crumbling architecture etc are mooted by the absurd and downright goofy way that the characters behave In the pursuit of realism Pasolini utilized many non actors but their deer in the headlights stares and painfully awkward line delivery gives the whole a terribly off kilter and inconsistent feel And frankly many of the toothless misshapenly featured people are painful to look at br br And Pasolini s Decameron is disturbing to me at least because of the casual and prevalent homosexual content Not because I m prudish or homophobic I m neither but because the emphasis that Pasolini places upon homoerotic images and situations is contrary to the neo realism he otherwise espouses so it comes off as gratuitous and forced One can almost hear him say Ooh I ve got to stick a cute naked boy in this scene At times it seems that Pasolini is trying to play up the homosexual angle to thumb his nose at critics and at other times because he enjoys that aspect himself regardless of what his audience might prefer br br The disjointedness of the 9 or 10 different stories in Pasolini s Decameron struck me as being a failing of Pasolini as a storyteller rather than being an aspect of neo realism He seems to get bored with each story and so he wraps them up rather unconvincingly and with little conviction Even the Pasolini s final line of dialog in the film which some people seem to find pithy Why create a work of art when dreaming about it is so much sweeter to me it just makes me wonder why Pasolini would bother making a film if he felt this way In my opinion a far better crafted film and with MORE homosexual content is Fellini s Satyricon It is also full of bizarre looking people and absurd situations but it succeeds because of its pacing direction and strong storytelling whereas Decameron fails by those same elements
This is a review of Freddy Mercury The Untold Story theatrical release Chicago Int Film Festival 2007 One of the phoniest uninspired and most tedious biographical documentaries I have seen If the film I saw in a movie theater was originally released on TV I would plead with its producers and distributors to not fool a paying audience with the false promise of a cinematically worthy documentary feature Even as a made for TV documentary the sentimental piano solos accompanying interviewees sitting in front of flower arrangements in hotel rooms and the pompous pseudo literary narration rang more true of a sleepapedic bed Infomercial The only redeeming aspects of this The Untold Story of Freddy Mercury or uhm was it The Untold Story of Princess Diana are the original concert video and TV footage unabridged Freddy Mercury and Queen Testimonial interviews with irrelevant eye witnesses with insights such as He was a free spirit really I thought Freddy Mercury was a company man belittle those Freddy testimonials by Brian May or Montserrat Caballe that shed new and affectionate light into Mercury s complex life and character And what up with the Harry Potter like boarding school segments How did the interview with the first girl crush who now works in a travel agency and members of Freddy s first school band contribute to what I really want to know about Mercury Vital milestones of his personal life his sexuality his artistic style and growth Queen the band remain unexplored These filmmakers don t ask a single provocative question nor do they engage in independent or visionary research of their subject instead delivering a tedious montage of politely clean and vastly empty comments about an enigmatic and brilliant rock legend who doesn t deserve to be remembered by this History Channel biography your grandparents can doze off to on a Sunday night
Kojak meets the mafia Telly Savales is one of those guys from the past that seems pretty forgettable I never thought that his show was all that great This is his one dimensional characterization of a crime boss with very predictable results If you take the car chases and the general rambling out there isn t much plot development or action I find mafia movies to be dull because I have no respect or interest in common criminals and their actions Hollywood and in this case the Italian cinema treat these guys as heroes I saw the film and in a few days I won t remember much about it Lots of shooting innocent bystanders dying betrayal and that sick loyalty The film is photographed pretty well and the acting is decent But the dubbing is so bad due to voices that just couldn t come out of those bodies that I almost started looking for Godzilla approaching the bay
CRIME BOSS is directed by Alberto De Martino an Italian crime drama partially filmed in Hamburg Germany An easily forgotten movie Even in spite of a good car chase sequence this flick seems to lumber on almost aimlessly A new Don takes over a powerful Mafia family and finds himself fighting for his own life Unwritten laws and ethics of the Mafia code make it hard to trust in anyone especially when millions of dollars are at stake Brutality and violence breed the same in return This can not be put on a shelf with the real gangster epics Just the look of the film brings back memories of American drive in fare Even the popular American actor Telly Savalas can t boost the calibre of this crime drama Antonio Sabato also stars with Paola Tedesco Guido Lollobrigida Serio Tramonti and Piero Morgia
As if there weren t enough of those floating around at the time already we have here another lame GODFATHER clone from the director of IL CONSIGLIORI 1973 which I had watched earlier this year The marquee value name roped in this time is Telly Savalas who belatedly enters the proceedings and is first seen from behind rather campily tending to his flowers and wearing a beret in the style of French painters Apart from not looking minimally Sicilian he sports no accent of any kind other than his familiar drawl Antonio Sabato then makes for an unlikely gangster apart from being a resistible leading man his relationship with Savalas which becomes paternal at the flick of an eye is also unconvincing especially since he subsequently becomes romantically involved with the latter s spirited teenage niece Besides for a gangster flick there s precious little action to speak of and none of it is in any way memorable though the finale set in a clinic is well enough handled furthermore the score by Francesco De Masi is serviceable but nothing else Incidentally the bargain basement DVD I rented starts off midway through the credits so that none of the cast members or even the film s title is ever listed
Alright if you want to go see this movie just give me our money I ll br br kick you were it counts and you ll have the same amount of fun I ll br br even guarantee more fun This movie once again shows what happens when br br you can t get any one else to hire your family and your forced to make br br your own movies Same I m going through puberty humor jokes just br br dumber and grosser This movie is really a disgrace to movie goers They br br try to shock you into laughing because you can t believe the levels they br br have to stoop to make you laugh So my offer above stands as
After coming off the first one you think the wayans brothers could come up with some new jokes Though i guess not If the first one wasn t bad enough this one is just so bad it hurts to watch With all the actors they had in this film you think they could come up with something a little more clever Though they couldn t they had to take all the same raunchy not funny jokes from the first one and somehow put it into this film thinking people would laugh at it again Though the thing is i didn t laugh at it the first time They tried to make these movies into parodies though they failed at every level Most of the time it s just randomly inserted jokes that are so disgusting and raunchy that it s hard to watch it and enjoy it Then when they do try to do scenes that are movie parodies they just end up making a 20 minute recreation of the scene with maybe one joke within the entire scene Also for people saying that its not for the older and real young audience well i fit into the age range that it s supposed to be funny for While people say that different people have different ideas of what is funny or not if you do find this funny then you probably aren t one of the more mature or intelligent people around It doesn t take that much skill to write that kind of a script though if you do want a more clever and funnier movie go see the movie Spaceballs It s a movie parody that s actually good and well done and it didn t have to use disgusting and raunchy jokes to make it funny either
Given that this movie was put together in less than a year might explain its shortness 81 minutes including end credits so roughly 76 minutes of actual film But what it cannot explain is its lack of humor that the previous film possessed br br The gags are quick and sometimes not even funny The only true funny parts are the quick spoofs on the Nike basketball spots James Woods portrayal of Max Van Sydow s character in the Exorcist and bits and pieces scattered throughout the film Very unfunny was the take off of Charlie s Angels which like the first Scary Movie and the Matrix spin off scene basically recreated the scene without much humor injected into it br br Today s youth might not be able to relate to the spoof gags of the classic supernatural horror films of the 70 s such as the Exorcist and maybe of the 80s Poltergeist et al br br Hopefully Scary Movie 3 will take some time to put together making the spoofs more enjoyable br br One thing though the film features more than the last one of promising young actress Anna Faris whom I will admit seemed exceptionally hot in the sequel Just for her casting and acting ability I give this movie a 3 out of 10
The script for Scary Movie 2 just wasn t ready to go This is a problem with the film that is blatantly evident to the actors and the audience alike Director Keenan Ivory Wayans and many of the actors are funny people and so the movie isn t completely humorless To their credit the film has several funny moments But as a whole Scary Movie 2 is not even close to being as clever and amusing as the original br br The first Scary Movie was a laugh a minute film It turned the smallest subtleties of the slasher film genre into comedic gold The humor in Scary Movie 2 is as heavy handed as it is un original They even miss obvious opportunities for parody Two of the movies stars are former cast members of Beverly Hills 90210 and this was a show that was begging to be parodied In the final analysis Scary Movie 2 is like a fine bottle of wine that was opened far too soon The script needed a lot more time to age 2 stars out of 5
The first one was different and funny This attempt should have never left the studio This movie does not make you laugh It is a weak attempt at gross out humor The movie picks out current and old movies to rip off This time the jokes seem used and overdone The audience that I saw it with only re acted to Hannibal dinner scene and was otherwise asleep
I know a few things that are worst A few It had a couple of funny scenes It is a movie not appropriate for kids but only a child would find this movie hilarious This is definetly a movie that you would like to use a free rental coupon for Don t waste your money just to laugh a couple of times
I was very disappointed by this movie I thought that Scary Movie although not a great movie was very good and funny Scary Movie 2 on the other hand was boring not funny and at times plain stupid br br The Exorcist Amityville spoof was probably the best part of the movie James Woods was great br br Now I ll admit that I am at a disadvantage since I have not seen a few of the movies that this parodies unlike the first where I had basically seen them all But bad comedy is still bad comedy br br Something that really hurt this movie was the timing which ruined some of what might have been good jokes Scenes and jokes drag out way to long br br Also the same jokes keep getting repeated again and again For example the talking bird Ok it was funny the first and maybe even the second time But it kept getting repeated to the point of annoying The routine between the wheelchair guy and Hanson Chris Elliott was amusing at first but it kept getting repeated and ended up stupid and even tasteless br br Some jokes even got repeated from the first movie For example the creaming I guess you would call it of Cindy Anna Faris was funny in Scary Movie because Cindy had been holding out on giving her boyfriend sex for so long that essentially he had blue balls from hell and it was funny when he creamed her But this time around it was out of place and not funny br br The bathroom and sexual humor in general was more amusing and well timed the first time around The scat humor was excessive though and rather unneccessary in the second film br br Tori Spelling was annoying and really had no place in this movie br br But I did enjoy Shorty Marlon Wayans who in my opinion was the funniest character in the first film The scene with him and the pot plant was one of my favorites from the second film br br Don t get me wrong I love the Wayans family and their humor That is why this film is so disappointing they have a lot more comic ability than endless scat jokes
Scary Movie 2 was a grave disappointment Simply referencing movies like Mission Impossible 2 does not lead to comedy The movie opens well enough with a funny white people rapping scene and an excellent use of James Woods ands Andy Richter The movie plummets from there unfortunately The acting is awful Tori Spelling looks and acts completely out of place The movie looks hacked together and is surprisingly slow paced Some of the longer gags in this snail paced movie involving joints and a previously mentioned Tom Cruise movie werent funny to anyone in my theater The movie thankfully comes screeching to a halt at 83 minutes in a shockingly unfunny ending I say shocking because the ending does not even attempt to end with humor I dont know what else to say except that is a sloppy rushed sequel done to make Miramax some more cash on the backs of dumb teenagers Overall a very poorly done movie
Scary Movie 2 is a let down to the Scary Movie Franchise Scary Movie 1 3 and 4 were all good but this one was kind of boring and not very funny Luckily they picked their act up after this one and made two more great Scary Movies br br This film is about a group of teens who get tricked by their Professor into going to a haunted mansion for a night Things start to go wrong and then they realize they have to escape br br This movie isn t horrible but they could have improved quite a few things It is a bit of fun and if you liked the other movies in the Scary Movie franchise then give this a watch but I don t think you will like it nearly as much
Scary Movie 2 is definitely the worst of the 4 films for there is not much of a plot bad acting pretty tedious and some really cheesy jokes But And this is a big but there is one good actor one good recurring joke and a good beginning The good actor being Tim Curry the one good recurring joke is the creepy weird butler with the disgusting hand who always does cringey but laugh worthy things And the good beginning is the spoof of the Excorsist br br The plot to Scary Movie 2 is the main characters from the original and a host of new characters along the way are invited to stay the night at a creepy old mansion but will they survive the night This film is not very good but if your bored you might as well watch it
I loved the original Scary Movie I m a huge fan of parody it is my favorite form of humor It is sometimes regarded as the most intelligent form of humor The Wayans boys seemed to grasp that concept perfectly in the original film then temporarily forgot it when making the sequel I think the Wayans are a family of comical geniuses Alas even geniuses make mistakes br br The movie begins with promise I liked The Exorcist parody especially the come on out ma gag Now that s Wayans quality material But other than that I can only think of two other times I laughed 1 when Tori Spelling is seduced in the middle of the night by a spirit then becomes clingy and starts talking about marriage with him Meanwhile he s saying It was just a booty call That was kinda funny 2 The Save the Last Dance parody where the Cindy character inadvertently beats up a girl while practicing her new moves But even the short lived giggles are no match for the side splitting laughs of the first Scary Movie br br The rest of the movie is pure trash filled with cheap gross out gags Jokes from the first movie which were subtle or implied are magnified and overdone For example in Scary Movie I several innuendos are made to imply that the character Ray is gay This was hilarious But in Scary Movie II the whole penis strangulation scene with Ray under the bed was mind numbing and incredibly unfunny This is the pattern of the whole film Shock humor alone doesn t take a movie very far This was a trend in 2000 and 2001 unfortunately br br As much as it pains me to rate a Wayans movie so low I have to give this one a 2 out of 10
Keenan Ivory Wayans is probably one of the worst directors i swear he has no real knowledge on how to make films he has made one brilliant film and that is scary movie scary movie 2 was OK too but everything else Keenan has made are real disasters avoid such titles like don t be a menace to south central while drinking your juice in the hood i know what a title obviously this film too just anything that has Keenans name in the credits br br it was an hour and a half on stupid nonsense that never made me laugh just trust me on this maybe women might like this film a little because of some of things that happen but on a whole this film will never be liked by anyone with a good taste in films 1 10 j d Seaton
Basically this is an overlong unfunny action comedy First of all I d like to say that I did enjoy the Wayans brother Scary Movie 1 and the sequel had it s moments Unfortunately white chicks doesn t even deliver HALF the laughs br br The humour in it is absolutely crude If you like burping farting stupid catchphrases you should probably look at this When it isn t crude it s idiotic The first 10 minutes of the film gave everything away to me totally unfunny simply idiotic br br However I watched the whole thing since I was with a friend otherwise I wouldn t have bothered The story is undeniably thin it was in scary movie too but there at least the laughs were quick and constant I think this is probably one of the main problems too with this film the laughs don t come quick enough Some jokes are dragged out too long when they re more disgusting than funny in the first place If you prefer your comedy with a few brain cells then just avoid this If you want a silly comedy with more laughs then look at scary movie airplane hotshots 1 2 br br 1 10 Completely unfunny Thin storyline A film that seems to be based on one idea i e what if we dressed up as white chicks for a film but simply didn t have enough material
I don t often go out of my way to write comments but for this I had to just to warn anyone that might think that by watching this they will see a comedy This doesn t come close While the premise change in colour gender whatever is bad enough and has been done better many times before the actual transformation of two black guys into two white girls is one of the least convincing transformations ever put on screen It would be bad enough if all that was required by the script was a change to white chicks However the Wayans brothers are required to disguise themselves as two specific white women As you will have guessed by now they fail completely I have seen drag queens without makeup make more convincing women than these two do with the best special effects and make up people that Hollywood can provide Its appalling Add to the mix a basketball player built like a building terrible dialogue and more plot holes than a golf course and this film hits a new personal low And I like bad movies Avoid like the plague
WHITE CHICKS Hold on why couldn t they have dressed as Black Chicks oh yeah they wouldn t look different at all Can anyone give me one Wayans movie where they haven t dressed up as ladies Don t Be A Menace doesn t count Jack White and Michael Costanza ghost wrote that the other Norton Trio members acted as Directors br br In White Chicks there s never really any jokes It s just the Wayans acting like girls for 2 hours There s no setups no punchlines and no laughs There is a lot of I think I m gonna play some Time Crisis 3 At least for me there was 5 times to be exact br br Somebody has to tell Kenan Ivory Damon Marlon Shawn Damien the only talented one Kim Rakeesha George W and Osama Bin Wayans to stop making movies Its only hurting the O Zone layer br br VERDICT 1 2 out of
I wanted so much to enjoy this movie It moved very slowly and was just boring If it had been on TV it would have lasted 15 to 20 minutes maybe What happened to the story A great cast and photographer were working on a faulty foundation If this is loosely based on the life of the director why didn t he get someone to see that the writing itself was loose Then he directed it at a snail s pace which may have been the source of a few people nodding off during the movie The music soars but for a different film not this one for soap opera saga possibly There were times when the dialogue was not understandable when Armin Meuller Stahl was speaking I was not alone because I heard a few rumblings about who said what to whom Why can t Hollywood make better movies This one had the nugget of a great story but was just poorly executed
I enjoyed the movie very much emotionally intellectually and visually It contains no violence or sex or drugs or special effects and doesn t need them one bit holding my attention the entire time with the visuals story and interspersed words of wisdom br br However 1 some of the foreign language accents made the dialog difficult to hear understand 2 there is unnecessary overuse of swearing especially the F word which is the only reason this movie was rated R 3 The movie is balanced with humor and emotion but most of the emotion that holds you throughout the film except the final resolution last minutes is unpleasant due to the exaggerated long lasting dysfunctional reaction of some of the characters to loss living in the depths of bitterness and depression for too long 4 I will not recommend this movie because of 5 seconds of background narration which did not add one bit to the side character it applied to or the film it only turned me off to the movie and stuck in my brain through the whole movie and afterward the main character s mother of German ancestry when watching old WWII movies secretly roots for the Germans There would be no local color or art if the Nazi s won the war I don t know of any Germans today except radical skinheads who think the world would be a better place if the Nazi s won WWII
As gently as I can I sincerely believe this movie is a waste of time I did not find it the warm emotionally satisfying film others did I found it boring with music that distracted from the film The story was thin the characters overdrawn and the direction pedestrian br br Fooey br br Now I m going to write some more about this movie so I make the 10 line minimum There really isn t more to be said and brevity is important but IMDb has its minimums so here goes br br Young eager kid finds nascent talent seeks time with aging embittered mentor in spite of father s cartoonish homophobia Aging embittered mentor turns out to drink a lot and teach very little conflict arises While I don t think this is a spoiler I ve added the warning in case someone feels this much information is too much br br Mostly I just found the film boring and pretentious A waste of my time I honestly don t understand what little fuss there seems to be mostly on this web site about the transcendent quality of this movie I think it s really worth avoiding But as Dennis Miller used to say Maybe I m wrong
This movie was a major disappointment on direction intellectual niveau plot and in the way it dealt with its subject painting It is a slow moving film set like an episode of Wonder Years with appalling lack of depth though It also fails to deliver its message in a convincing manner br br The approach to the subject of painting is very elite limited to vague and subjective terms as beauty According to the makers of this movie beauty can be only experienced in Bob Ross style kitschy landscape paintings Good art according to this film can be achieved by applying basic like primary school level color theory and lots of sentiment In parts the movie is offending e g at a point it is stated rather celebrated by dancing on tables that mentally handicapped people are not capable of having emotions or expressing them through painting their works by definition being worthless bullshit quote br br I do not understand how the movie could get such high rating then again so far not many people rated it and they chose for only very high or very low grades
There are pretty landscape shots Writers putting trite mouthings into actors mouths With lesser actors this show would be silly Art must uplift humanity or it s BS Not so because art of all those mentioned is also to stir humanity and express the dark side The lead character even says those who don t drink hide the shadow side Wrong he lived in darkness and repressed his dark side by drinking and being one dimensional not expanding his horizons with something other than landscapes There wasn t a breathing organism in his work nor expression of his pain All the artist did was limit himself to dime a dozen landscapes The discussions between the characters was grade school trite stuff always giving the one character the upper hand the writer wanted I tried to like it after reading all the first wow comments on here I had to dig deep to see those i agreed with I figure the great comments were from those connected to the movie I was moved only once towards the end The kid was way too passive The scenery was nice and the music ridiculous Just my opinion but nowhere show for me
I suppose it s nice and trendy to see wonderful things in the absolute emptiness of a film like this With the sometimes pointless excesses of many Hollywood films we can relax and enjoy a scene devoid of explosions foul language and corny one liners Minimalism has its place and can be very effective when employed properly However this film is not one of those cases br br Take the long scenes with no dialogue and dreary sparse scenery I m sure that they must hold some great meaning and insight because the implied message in shrouded in bafflement The acting is poor bland and pedestrian and features one of the worst crying scenes in history at the end of the film if you can sit through it to the end The scenery is drab and the ridiculously long ending sequence of the girl walking through the barren park is as pleasurable as having a tooth pulled I would call this anticlimatic but as the film didn t build to any sort of climax whatsoever not even in the erotic scenes it would be untrue I m sure that there was a script employed during the filming but with the amount of dialogue I think it might have been written on a cocktail napkin Basically this film offers nothing to interest or amaze no great story no stunning insights no visual drama no excitement Apart from two or three amusing moments this film is a waste of two hours A tragically boring and dreary film
I enjoy a good slow moving drama Christmas In August Chungking Express Virgin Stripped Bare By Her Bachelors The Way Home Springtime in a Small Town Hana bi Eat Drink Man Woman Dolls In the Mood for Love and Spring Summer Fall Winter Spring are all enjoyable films just to name a few br br Unfortunately there is a subset of films within the drama genre that attempt to ride the coattails of good films while providing nothing of interest themselves These are what I call IAN films Incomprehensible Artistic Nonsense Tsai Ming liang is the king of this subgenre and Vive L Amour is his masterpiece In fact this is the crème de la crème of crap infested garbage under the guise of art People walk around in their apartments drink water stroll back and forth waiting for pay phones to become vacant hang posters staple papers together go to the bathroom eat do pushups have sex slap at mosquitoes etc I m not joking when I say that is an accurate synopsis of the entire film which is the quintessential posterchild for pointless art house trash There is no plot no storyline no interesting or noteworthy events no emotion no meaningful dialogue and most importantly no drama br br The most eventful scene has two people banging on a bed with a person masturbating underneath the mattress ironic that it s also totally tasteless and gratuitous The relationship of the characters on the bed is practically non existent Tsai apparently didn t feel like communicating anything to the viewer regarding these people other than the obvious fact that they like to bang The person under the bed is just as one dimensional and uninteresting He likes to drink water makeout with melons and stroke himself This is Tsai s idea of character development A truly misguided entertainer indeed br br Tsai s true contribution in Vive L Amour is perhaps the most atrocious scene in art house film history He first shows the lead actress walk all the way from one end of a park to the other for 285 consecutive seconds only to then show her cry hysterically for absolutely no reason whatsoever for another 356 consecutive seconds The film then abruptly ends No point No entertainment Just pure concentrated torture inflicted on the viewer br br In an effort to beat a dead horse The underlying theme of loneliness is mishandled so greatly that the only true feeling of this film is that of boredom In fact Kiyoshi Kurosawa provides a much better exposition on loneliness in his horror film Kairo And guess what It s actually INTERESTING That film moved as slow as molasses in January but there are better ways of addressing the concept of loneliness than the utter waste known as Vive L Amour Kairo is a perfect example of that br br Fans of cinema may thank Tsai Ming liang for directing this film as he has provided irrefutable evidence that art house cinema can be just as poorly made as B grade made for television horror flicks Art house snobs have now officially lost their pedestal of self righteousness The quality level of your precious genre now overlaps films like Army of Darkness and gasp Showgirls How do you like them apples
Need I say its a stinker I gave it a rating of 2 br br Only watch it if you suffer from insomnia br br There s plenty of scenery chewing and hamming it up but not much else happens in this movie There is no suspense no deep shocking secrets revealed no real threat to the heroine s well being A few disagreements slight raising of voices that s pretty much it The secrets are nothing that couldn t happen to anybody the last secret revealed in the film is totally predictable by that point br br The plot such as it is revolves around a young woman named Faith Meg Tilly who is an artist who is hired to paint a series of mural panels in a huge ballroom in a vast mansion by a very very wealthy older widowed woman and a growing mother daughter type relationship that the older woman craves with her br br It turns out the older woman s daughter Cassandra is dead You can pretty well fit the rest of the pieces together br br Even the scene with the mysterious man menacing our heroine does not advance to the point where you really fear for her safety beyond maybe a second or two Why he s still hanging around years after Cassandra s death is a good question br br There s also the question of the fact that in this vast mansion there is only one servant a faithful butler who seems to do everything cooking cleaning serving the meal answering the door etc Everything except apparently locking the door since that would be the only explanation for how one of the characters just walks into a room where Faith is br br There s nothing that will have you grasping your chair arms and leaning forward on the edge of your seat because there IS no mounting tension in this film just bland pathetic revelations that get tossed out from time to time br br
Three writers made a valiant attempt to adapt Jane Stanton Hitchcock s novel for the tube yet this television movie has ultimately been injected with too much melodrama and just doesn t know when to quit Struggling artist Meg Tilly suddenly finds herself employed by wealthy enigmatic Ellen Burstyn who desires a mural painted on the walls of her unused ballroom After learning about the last gathering held there Ellen s daughter s coming out party Tilly decides on her artistic theme never dreaming the daughter died mysteriously before the function even began nor that she and the deceased bore a striking resemblance to one another Two superb actresses lend their services to an incredible yarn which doesn t bear close scrutiny one that fails to match either lady in emotional intensity Burstyn s role teeters on camp while Tilly gets stuck doing the dreamy eyed waif routine Only one sequence late in the film the morning after the mural is finished is charged with honest feeling anger and betrayal The rest is piffle
1st watched 5 17 2002 3 out of 10 Dir Ewald Andre Dupont Fairly lame account of the Titanic disaster is the first filmed version of this much heralded event The replication of the disaster is not bad but the drama around it is at some times silly badly acted and way too soap opera like The story is very much the same as the most recent Oscar winning one except that we are shown how the crew tried to hide the actual disaster that was occurring until almost too late Good for nostalgia purposes only and to get a feel for what James Cameron was competing against barely in his recreation
I am a Motion Picture Production major at Wright State University in Ohio and yesterday I was sadly given the opportunity to watch this god awful film in class We were informed by our professor that it would be very funny to us but the reason we were watching it was because it was one of the first sound films a complete disaster br br The problem with early sound films was that Hollywood actors only knew how to do silent movies and they weren t good at memorizing lines So producers and directors would look to the stage to get actors Sounds like a great idea right Well the kind of acting one does on stage doesn t show up too well on film Most of the actors in Atlantic look and sound like they re acting in a play which results in lots of hearty laughs at the over acting Another limitation of early sound film was the technology of microphones You couldn t move the mikes like you can today you had to keep them static or it would pick up the sound of air moving through There was usually one mike used in any given scene in this movie In one particular scene there is a man sitting at a table Someone walks right up to him and delivers their line then walks away Another actor comes up from behind him delivers their line then walks away It goes on like this for a couple more people The microphone is obviously right by the man at the table making for a laughable actor carousel br br Those are only technical problems If you get into the story and direction then it gets even worse The story is a fictionalized account of what happened on the Titanic The characters are unbelievable and pointless A story about a man cheating on his wife and their teenage daughter has no place in the movie It is barely resolved and leaves you wondering why it was there in the first place A lousy attempt at high drama the actors take long pregnant pauses between lines many times It is tiresome and you can t wait for this 90 minute feels like 180 at least movie to get over with I m not going to talk a whole lot about the issue of racism at this time in our country but it really offended me that there were only two blacks in the whole movie and they were portrayed as animals They both pushed past the women and children to try and get in one of the lifeboats They were ordered to stop or be shot and of course they didn t so they were shot I was appalled br br I give this movie a 2 10 I would have given it a 1 10 the lowest rating possible but I gave it an extra point just because it was one of the first sound films and I tried to put it into context If you want to see a good early sound film check out Alfred Hitchcock s Blackmail that also came out in the year 1929 You will find that the best directors were able to adapt to new technology immediately
Yes I know talkies had just been invented for the cinema 2 years earlier when this was produced in 1929 but this film showed that much had to learnt about the art of producing films It comes over as a filmed hammy stage play with the actors melodramatically enunciating their lines rolling their eyes using too many pregnant pauses and using gestures more appropriate to silent cinema which I suppose was normal during the process of educating them to appear more naturalistic on screen The gaps between lines spoken should have been tightened up during editing as it considerably slows the film It is now only of interest for Titanic buffs who want to see an early example of this marine accident on film In next chronological order they could see Titanic 1953 A Night to Remember 1958 Titanic 1997 to see how the cinema s depiction of this tragedy as evolved over the years There have been many documentaries and TV films made including the atrocious SOS Titanic 1979 On my version which is a DVD David McCallum gives the introduction It was he who played Harold Bride Marconi s junior wireless operator in A Night to Remember still the best feature film please read my Tribute to Walter comments on IMDb under Howard Morley demon co uk and gave the commentary on the series of 4 videos entitled End of a Dream so he was well qualified to give the narration Of more interest I found was a recording accompanied by actual photos of the 1912 US Senate hearing which is also on the DVD Actors speak the actual words spoken by Lightoller 2nd officer J Bruce Ismay Managing director of White Star Harold Bride and others including Gloria Stewart The old Rose in Titanic 1997 whose voice is used for one of the first class women survivors
No movie with Madeleine Carroll in its cast could possibly be unwatchable That said I have to add that this British film comes close The story takes place on board the SS Atlantic and it s loosely based on the Titanic s unfinished voyage The word unsinkable is spoken the liner strikes an iceberg and we hear a heavenly choir sing Nearer My God to Thee The doomed passengers eventually take over the anthem in a clever bit of sound work But the year of the film s release 1929 means that a modern viewer has to accept otherwise primitive sound and many of the acting conventions of silent films and the stage These aren t problems The film s major flaw is pacing and pacing had been well developed in silents However if the dialog were delivered at a realistic speed the movie s running time would be cut in half The intended effect was drama and clarity in a new medium but the result unhappily is tiresome now The film s structure is preposterously illogical and inept Paradoxically I found certain details of the editing quite modern in technique fine abrupt cuts from one area of the ship to another sometimes even on sound effects Although we re on board the Atlantic from the first shot we were well over 4 minutes into the movie before I discovered that fact There are long intrusive musical passages by the ship s dance orchestra Entertaining easy sound Personal stories are presented in an utterly uninvolving and unconvincing way Don t even think of spectacle The berg is a tiny thing and the exterior damage it does to the ship s hull is a minor dent However the scenes of passengers swarming into the lifeboats clearly staged on a real liner presumably tied up to a dock generate great excitement Other than the glorious Miss Carroll these sequences are the film s only points of excellence As the movie and the ship near their end the screen goes totally black several times when the power generators begin to fail Their last eternal blackout is the end of the film with a sunset sunrise tacked on a clumsy symbolic effect Atlantic is a cinema curiosity At best br br
This was talked about to death by the critics when it honestly isn t that great Sure CHAOS and INSIDE MAN are literally the same movie just with variations in suspense But I found CHAOS more enjoyable because it was fast paced kinda like the silly film Swordfish The reason this film is more popular is because this got released in the States and Chaos was aired all around the world at film festivals and foreign theaters but has yet to find a distributor in the U K and U S A br br It s true that this film makes lots of tributes to classic films like DOG DAY AFTERNOON and other Spike Lee films but that doesn t mean that it is a pleasant film to watch br br Watch it if nothing else is on T V but you ll probably get bored with after awhile
For me an unsatisfactory unconvincing heist movie With an A List cast particularly the three leads and an experienced maverick director like Spike Lee I was expecting far more and in the end felt that what was delivered added little to this movie sub genre For a start I didn t like the pacing of the film starting off with mastermind Clive Owen s raison d etre piece to camera unnecessarily repeated at the conclusion then finding the narrative peppered with confusing not to say unreal seeming witness interviews then finding yourself jumped into scenes you sense had begun earlier Of course the camera work is fluid throughout constantly on the move and incorporating hand camera shots a plenty but director Lee fails to deliver thrills or suspense falling down fundamentally by not making anything of the key protagonists in the film Denzel Washington is weighed down with the clothes and bad ass jive talk of a Shaft movie thirty five years earlier he even has that no one understands him but his woman thing going on replete with his hot girlfriend baiting her with some downright crude and inappropriate dirty talk and his mild In The Heat Of The Night riff with Willem Defoe in almost a bit part raises barely a ripple Clive Owens plays his character with a resolutely English accent even as we re given to believe the gang is Arab based also hindered by having to play 90 of the film with a mask over his face Jodie Foster delivers another of her patented tight lipped ice maiden sub Clarice Starling turns as a well connected financial bounty hunter if you will to little effect Overall it s a real mish mash of a film with a light but obvious twist at the end in fact the title gives it away from the start spoiler fans Worst scene of many is undoubtedly Washington s witness interview unbelievably with an 8 year old street kid although Owen s dialogue with the same child minutes earlier runs it close in the embarrassment stakes During the film in joke references are made by characters to classic heist films like Serpico and Dog Day Afternoon but there s no honour in self praise More like The Hot Rock instead and even that was good for a few laughs
First this film is not a thriller Neither is it gripping taut It might have been so based on the script but the direction s slow pace makes it difficult to get into br br The plot itself is very interesting and ingenious Unfortunately we only get a sense of how ingenious after the picture is over That leaves us with over two hours of long sequences with music playing over them punctuated by some action scenes that don t grab the viewer and cunning vixen scenes that inject a little more overt intelligence br br I wish this had been the fast paced thriller the box promised It would ve been an outstanding film Instead Spike Lee made it plod along through the end
This movie had so much potential a strong cast a reasonably strong idea and clearly a decent budget I m not sure where it all went wrong but each of those elements was wasted The story went nowhere the characters were hollow to say the least and the result was a very boring pointless waste of a film I hated it Judging by the other votes I m in the minority here and must be some sort of freak However I thought this movie was dreadful I had high hopes but was very disappointed A particular disappointment was Jody Foster s character A very cocky fixer of sorts makes a nice idea Jody was confident and sexy but the character did nothing and went nowhere Denzel Washington played the same character he always plays enjoyable but nothing new
The trailers for this film were better than the movie What waste of talent and money Wish I would ve waited for this movie to come on DVD because at least I wouldn t be out 9 The movie totally misses the mark What could have been a GREAT movie for all actors turned out to be a B movie at best Movie moved VERY slow and just when I thought it was going somewhere it almost did but then it didn t In this day and age we need unpredictable plot twists and closures in film and this film offered neither The whole thing about how everyone is a suspect is good however not sure if it was the way it was directed the lighting the delivery of lines the writing or what but nothing came from it Lot of hype for nothing I was VERY disappointed in this film and I m telling everyone NOT to see it The cheesy saxophone music throughout made the film worse as well And the ending had NOTHING to do with the rest of the film What a disappointment
Now isn t it Considering all the good work done by danzel Clive and Jodie the movie never grew into something more than a horrible die hard heist movies copycat Yes a couple of jokes no absolutely no unpredictable twists to be honest the only unpredictable moments are there because both director and editor made some stupid mistakes it is a shame for them and a waste of time for us IF someone can tell me why on earth were they digging a hole inside that safe who the hell is the Rebe and how on earth did they know that the diamonds were in the particular cell it could just make my day but it seems that Spike asks us to take too much things in this one for granted and do not raise our eyebrows when something looks stupid its just another studio contract movie relax and enjoy
Three story lines and not enough tying them together Inside Man was very jumpy and an incomplete attempt to be artistic and realistic Though having its moments the movie started off looking like a fast thriller which quickly grounded to a slow crawl jumped quickly between highs and lows and only barely picked up steam again near the last 20 minutes I will give credit to Denzel Washington he played his part extremely well with a full grasp of his human side and not just the typical super detective with all the answers Clive Owen also did quite well with his duality part as evil genius and criminal mastermind both not the same in retrospect Overall though each person individually created a great sub section Yet when the parts finally came together and everything counted there was no sudden ah ha or summation of everything It all ended up with very little of the energy it began with with a lot of plot holes tons of questions and as I said earlier no where near Spike Lee s normal level I have to completely disagree with the so called professional critics this is not the movie they play it up to be
This movie makes no sense at all there are plot holes big enough to drive enormous NYPD vehicles through The characters do not act in any plausible way whatsoever I will put my comments in the chat board but save your time and money this is stupid I can t stand when Hollywood spends millions of dollars on flash bang equipment and uses fancy editing and cool music and does not bother to have a plot that hangs together at even the most basic level But it is nice to see Denzel W prevail over the Man who comes in 3 flavors Jodi Foster Mayor Bloomberg and Capt Von Trapp There is even a sweet little kid with a video game who is nice
This is a dumb movie Maybe my judgment wouldn t be so harsh if the film didn t promise so much but I just felt like this movie cheated and played me for a fool at every turn br br I didn t have any beef with the acting but I thought the characters were awful The movie starts off with Clive Owen s character telling us what a criminal mastermind he is and how he planned the perfect bank robbery something he frequently reminds us of later Oh yeah he also tells us he s in a prison cell although that turns out to be a dumb metaphor Any idiot knows that the best bank robbery is one where a minimum number of things could potentially go wrong and you re long gone before the police show up But Clive Owen s scheme requires hanging around the bank for hours for no reason but to stalk around and look scary as far as I can tell He also has to control hostages negotiate with cops and most fantastically of all perform a This Old House job on the bank s stockroom and hide out there for a week I hope he brought enough food and a bucket to pee in and then sneak out again Yeah that sure sounds like the perfect crime to me Clive This plan has so many moving parts that the only reason it didn t fall apart was the screenwriter said so br br And then there are the many unexplained details Why were the cops so convinced that the crooks had accomplices among the hostages Who the hell is Jodie Foster s character and why is she so important that she has the mayor at her beck and call and she doesn t have to tell Denzel Washington her agenda because it s above his pay scale How dumb are these cops that they can t figure out one guy speaking in a foreign language for hours is not the sound of a criminal gang planning a robbery How did the robbers slip away and why did Clive Owen stick around for a week How did they find out about the bank chairman s past and the number and contents of his safe deposit box Why the hell would Clive Owen let in Jodie Foster or the cops Since when do they make toy AK 47s that look real up close How the hell do you bug a pizza box anyway How did Clive Owen manage to sneak out of a secure area of the bank during working hours undetected Did this dispassionate criminal really feel bonded enough to this cop Denzel to slip him a diamond br br None of these questions are ever answered There are films that achieve depth by leaving you to wonder about events that happen off screen but I never felt that way about Inside Man It felt like the scenes that explained these things were cut from the movie or these questions never had any answers in the first place and that s weak Particularly annoying is Jodie Foster s character who won t disclose what she does but never seems to tire of reminding us how important she is We re just supposed to take her word for it I guess br br The only reason I gave this movie two stars is I laughed at Denzel s taxi cab and pina colada gags and at the kid s outrageous video game Other than that this movie has no redeeming features
Movie There are some very interesting comments on IMDb about this movie Its truly awful Not enough money is spent on the movie and the way Spike Lee has made it it seems like a combination of an indie film and an action flick Characters Actors Denzel has done EXACTLY what he does in every movie so no surprise there Here is a little mind game for the readers Quickly think of 10 Denzel movies Now count how many of them were in which he played a cop detective body guard whatever Clive Owen hmmmmmm this guy needs a better role on his plate soon His best performance was I think in Beyond Borders Other than that he did pretty much the same thing as he does in every movie as well His tone and way of talking was very similar to what he did in Sin City Surely this guy knows acting what he doesn t know is better way of choosing roles He is in desperate need of a better agent Jodie Foster was brilliant in the movie if you are watching her for the first time in your life She has done better She has had better roles It so happens in Hollywood that even the biggest stars fall down on their knees and pick up low class roles as Jody Foster did in this movie Plot Plot was not confusing in fact I could think of such a plot in fact the whole movie while taking a dump after a nice big Chinese dinner I mean come on SPOILER ON THE WAY I am sick of the un necessary Haulocast and the Racism token The movie is about bank robbers why put the Haulocast and the Racism in there nice try playing with people s emotions worked on anyone NOT ME Police let the bank robbers go thinking they were hostages Riiiiiiight please we re talking about US police force and security here Nobody could find out where Clive was I mean they didn t find anything different with that room Who re we kidding Conclusion Sure go watch this movie if nothing you ll have a nice time talking to you friends how bad the movie was At least people won t think you re stupid to go watch this movie because they d think you went to watch it because it has a big star cast MISTAKE
A yawn inducing snail paced disappointment Inside Man tells the story of a detective Denzel Washington who is under investigation due to his possible involvement in a case of missing money When a bank is robbed and hostages are held against their will by a mastermind thief Clive Owen and his team the detective is assigned to coerce the thief to surrender his one shot at proving he is innocent and worthy of his position Enter a powerful woman Jodie Foster with secrets and intents of her own sent to recover an item from the bank owner s safety deposit box that is stored within the bank and you have quite the three way dilemma Unfortunately all you get it set up in the film and nothing pays off in the end Denzel Washington is at his most uninteresting in an ineffective and distastefully egocentric performance The only saving grace for the film is its competent co stars Jodie Foster and Clive Owen who are much better than the film itself In fact Jodie Foster delivers the most surprising and high caliber performance playing against type as a ruthless cutthroat villain of sorts Clive Owen isn t given much to do besides brood and pose but the depth of his presence and his achieved acting ability more than make up for his underdeveloped role It s strange that so much talent is wasted on this film of little impact or interest You have to wonder what director Spike Lee was thinking while he was creating this film The most perplexing aspect of Inside Man however is how much unwarranted praise it has received For a film that seemed to have all the makings of a pre summer blockbuster this one falls horribly flat
My wife and I found this film to be highly unsatisfying While the plot keeps you interested and busy wondering just what is going on when you leave the theater there are just too many loose ends that make no sense at all SPOILERS AHEAD Christopher Plummer enormously wealthy head of a NY bank has a terrible hidden secret Profiting from WW II deals with the Nazis and hiding loot stolen from Jews he keeps the evidence including diamonds and documents with the Nazi swastika in a safety deposit box in his bank Why If he wants this never to be revealed why did he not burn and destroy the documents years ago And the diamonds Obviously he does not need them why keep them rather than dispose of them How did the bank robbers find out his secret How did they know to zero in on this very safety deposit box 232 Ace detective Denzel Washington also discovers bank records show SD Boxes No s 231 and 233 but no 232 Curious He meticulously found time somehow to do an exhausting search of bank records to unearth this one curious fact All the while dealing with a red hot hostage situation and bank robbers threatening to start executing them momentarily Wow Talk about super powers for a detective br br The bank robbers leave behind millions of dollars in loose currency in the vault they have opened They take only the contents of SD Box 232 ostensibly for the purpose of blackmailing the bank president This defies any rational attempt at a logical explanation for what the film depicts as a criminal mastermind or for his henchmen with lesser brains br br Jodie Foster using her political connections with the Mayor of NYC gains permission to enter the bank which is under the control of the bank robbers while holding many hostages She offers the chief bank robber a deal to buy back the documents he now has in hand but he ain t interested So what s his point if any br br My wife was offended by the arrogance of all the players Christopher Plummer Bank President Denzel Washington ace detective and Jodie Foster crack trouble shooter for high powered problems br br The last Jodie Foster movie I saw Flight Plan was also riddled with holes that made no sense at all I thought I liked Jodie Foster but I will probably avoid her future films br br Now my problem is that I can rarely persuade my wife to go to the movies I cannot disagree with her on this one A WASTE OF MONEY AND A WASTE OF TIME Be forewarned A well crafted film fine actors lousy script writing
I have never seen any of Spike Lee s prior films as their trailers never caught my interest I have seen and admire Denzel Washington and Jodie Foster s work and have several of their DVDs I was however entirely disappointed with this movie If this film is any indication of Spike Lee s ability as a director my advice would be to get a job and stop wasting the time and talent of others br br I wonder if some of the other IMDb commentators watched the same movie that I d seen I can only assume from their sappy lovelorn reviews that their adoration of Spike Lee has blinded them to the banality of this piece of work I only paid 2 50 in a Second Run theater and still felt I d wasted my money br br The IMDb Trivia page says it all br br Shot in 39 days How can you expect to shoot a big budget Blockbuster as the media hype promised in such a short time No wonder there was such a weak performance by all br br Ron Howard was first going to direct the film He may have done this project some justice given more time to do so of course Though the writing was atrocious the premise had some merits br br OK maybe not I m sorry This film was so rife with pitiful cliché s implausible scenes and lousy characterizations that maybe even he couldn t have made much of it Hey Ron Be sure to thank Russell Good call br br Jodie Foster filmed her part in three weeks And it showed Her portrayal of a Fixer who makes people s problems go away was as unbelievable as the script she was given Did she even want to be there br br Other Peeves br br How many bank robbers would bother to come to the door and inform a uniformed police officer that they were inside robbing the bank and he d better keep away or else br br When Detective Frazier Denzel Washington comes into the bank to verify there are no corpses yet how many bank robbers without a gun would have led a cop much less let a cop back out to the front door allowing the police officer to walk behind him br br Det Frazier later claimed to have given the robber every reason to shoot me Why then in their brief struggle didn t he even try to expose the robber s face That may have gotten the response he was looking for a robber would have shot him just to prevent later identification And why did it take Steve Stevie Steve O the robber s accomplice so long to come and help out br br I understand that these weren t your typical bank robbers They had a different agenda and didn t want anyone harmed But the cops had no reason to think that they wouldn t To them it was a desperate situation Why then when two of the bad guys stepped outside to pick up the pizzas were they not taken down first of all how many robbers would have came outside without using a hostage as a shield Is this Spike Lee s version of NY City or SNL s Taking them down would have reduced the bad guy s numbers screwed up their plans and the remaining robbers would more probably have given up If not there at least would be fewer bad guys inside Give SWAT something to do or send them home br br What police department in this country would have allowed Madeline White Jodie Foster to just waltz right into the bank and discuss a matter with the robbers that she would not disclose to them first She had no authority no governmental credentials and besides this was after all already a hostage situation add one more br br Why wouldn t the Bank CEO Christopher Plummer just have destroyed the incriminating documents a long time ago Screw sentimentality The diamonds he could have sold br br Who was that schmuck the character not the actor with the Jersey accent that conveniently volunteered and said he knew the recording was 100 Albanian but yet he himself couldn t speak it SIR PUT YOUR HAND DOWN And his Ex wife What a schlump she was Both were totally unbelievable br br When interrogating suspects why did Det Frazier continually harass the individuals who were obviously not a part of the heist i e telling the elderly woman she could go and then she couldn t then could then couldn t Give me a break br br Who after seeing the bank robbers demand that the hostages put on jump suites couldn t deduce their escape plan included coming out of the bank pretending to be some of the hostages br br Near the end of the movie a false wall was shown to have been built in the supply room behind which Clive Owens hid out for a week where did the materials come from the drywall studs It was also to be assumed that they cut into the sewer so he could relieve himself The bank employees hadn t complained about the smell all week long Hello br br After such a debacle since the documents had fallen into the robber s hands what kind of references was Ms White expecting to get from the bank CEO seeing that he was now to be a target for blackmail due to her failure br br And last but certainly not least What s with the Electric Glide that Denzel did HOW STUPID Was that supposed to indicate his resolve to bring these guys to justice He looked rather like a man who hopped a ride on a shopping cart while trying to prevent a bowel movement Cheeee Zheeee br br Other than the mediocre plot lousy script bad acting and overall pitiful directing yada yada yada br br Hopefully this will give enough insight into the movie to help others decide whether to waste their money or not br br
It s a waist to indulge such great actors in such a weak and boring movie Besides all the unanswered questions posted in the other comments what s so difficult about capturing the robbers Just eliminate the bank workers see who was at the bank from all the cameras footage angles prior to the robbers entry and you have those extra 4 remaining robbers among the hostages Where is the suspense every body is talking about It was so obvious the moment the hostages were asked to change into this identical uniform that they were all going to walk out the front door seen it many times At least Mr Spike Lee could have seasoned the movie with some good music score and artistic shooting The Movie is not worth it Pronto
It seems to me that Stephen King s Bachman pen name was a way for him to put out some of the grimmer rawer more mean spirited stuff that he wanted to write without contaminating his brand name If you look back at the Bachman Books Running Man The Long Walk Roadwork Thinner you notice they have a sealed in feeling of airlessness and hopelessness about them that is distinct from mainstream King I realize that we are talking about the guy whose first novel featured a humiliated blood covered emotionally crippled teenage girl slaughtering everyone at her high school prom but mainstream King always at have characters and plot elements that leaven the grimness of the proceedings a bit and mostly have endings that offer at least a glimpse of hope and human feeling Bachman books are just plain mean and always end badly BTW Pet Semetary could have easily been a Bachman book if King hadn t revealed the alias by then And The Dark Half seems to be at least partially about his Bachman persona br br Thinner was the last Bachman book and man with its themes of class warfare revenge and death by starvation it is nasty So it should be no surprise that the movie follows suit br br What is a surprise is that the adaptation seems to be filmed at a TV Movie Of the Week level of talent instead of something worthy of a theatrical release These days something like this would probably go directly to DVD or cable The makeup work and the striking motif starving to death in the midst of plenty a metaphor for the overfed undernourished American middle class if there ever was one is all that keeps you watching this misfire br br What went wrong My first thought is that the director was going for the nasty Bachman vibe but he also somehow sucked all the interest out of the movie with poor casting choices the actors here with the exception of Joe Monetegna simply can t carry the movie And then he squished the warmth and life out of the rest of the movie with awkward pacing and scene structure Plus he couldn t leave the plot alone and his changes don t really help The script and dialog ought to work but mostly the movie just lies there Everything is muffled dull airless and no fun to watch with the vivid exception of the spectacle of the main character getting thinner and thinner and thinner br br As other have pointed out Thinner is by no means the worst King movie ever made or even the second worst And it does have a dreadful compelling fascination owing to the theme and the careful makeup work But first time viewers should approach this one with lowered expectations
This movie was absolutely terrible I can t believe I paid to see it in the theatre I wouldn t watch it on free cable t v I m surprised that Joe Magtena even made it Do not waste your time with this movie
A fun concept but poorly executed Except for the fairly good makeup effects there s really not much to it There are obvious problems for example after taking what seems to be weeks and weeks to get from fat to normal size the main character seems to go from normal size to deathly thin in days and once he s deathly thin he stays pretty much equally deathly thin for what seems to be a long time br br In any case the movie has far worse problems than that the cinematography is decidedly low budget TV show quality and most of all the acting is pretty awful all around Robert John Burke seems to always be trying for some kind of weird snarling Charlton Heston impersonation and is literally painful to watch the only scary thing is that Lucinda Jenney and Kari Wuhrer are both even worse br br The only reason why I m giving this movie as high as I am is that once the movie enters its last 1 3 or so and Joe Mantegna s character takes over the movie develops a fun campy cheesefest slaughterhouse feel and the gangster s crazy schemes for tormenting the totally obnoxious gypsies are somewhat fun to watch The ending if predictable is also nicely mean Avoid unless you re a King o Phile or are REALLY psyched up at the idea of the voice of Fat Tony from the Simpsons terrorizing a gypsy camp
So Thinner Yep This Steven Bachman read Steven King yarn about a man who gets his just desserts from a Gypsy Elder who he just killed The story itself is there no doubt about it but I don t know why I didn t enjoy it more than I could have I guess what really distracted me was the actors I mean who s the lead Robert John Burke Who s he And fer crying out loud can someone please stop hiring Joseph Mantegna for every Italian Mafioso role there ever is And while we re at it does every Mafioso have to have a pasta cooking Italian mother The only good acting job done here is under 10 pounds of makeup Michael Constantine as the Gypsy elder He s pretty good But the rest I make you all better actors
To call a movie like Thinner bad is like calling the earth round or Pauly Shore un talented No news but how they got that way is what people want to know br br As far as this movie The book was good even if it was a little derivative of other stories from the be careful what you wish for genre Burke plays an overweight lawyer who kills the daughter of a gypsy and is cursed by her father Constantine from TV s Room 222 to several pounds a day br br Like I said it starts out good but why involve the mobster Mantegna Why fire automatic weapons so much Why turn it into something so heavily dependent on FX I thought it would have been much more effective if it focused more on the subtle ramifications of weight loss crazes diseases death gypsy lore and such br br But no it s not to be Remember this is Stephen King we re talking about br br And the ending almost the same as the book but a little too talky In fact the whole movie talks too much feeling it has to explain every plot turn to us Not that I expected The Dead Zone but I could have done without another Pet Sematary thanks anyway br br One star for at least trying to do a halfway decent makeup job However the rest of the movie is left to be say it with me Thinner
I began watching this movie with low expectations as a matter of fact i only noticed it because it was an adaptation of a S K novel a novel i never read br br I m glad my expectations were low because the movie wasn t nothing close to good but it manages to keep you interested What really drags this story down is the work done by the director and the actors The movie is overlong hasn t no nice shots and no scares the dialogs are dumb and the special effects are crap br br The only things good are that as i said it keeps you interested i guess the book must be good without using much horror cliches br br My Vote 4 10
I am not one of those who think King is a great writer his books are fine distractions for a few hours and often have interesting premises however they in my opinion fall apart pretty rapidly if you give them any serious thought br br This film suffers from being a pretty exact re telling of King s story If you have read the book there are zero surprises no changes no altering of scenes or characters This is a film made by King fans for King fans br br For the rest of us there is nothing terrible about the film it is a gypsy curse horror with its twist being the curse being something many people wish for to become thinner The final third has some severe structural problems and the slightly forced ending seems to break the rules of this genre a little br br There are worse ways to spend 90 minutes of your life but you might as well read the book because there is nothing new here br br
This move reminded my of Tales from the Crypt Keeper It has the same sort of idea of people get what they deserve I think that s always the them in a Crypt story The same goes for the bad acting Very bad acting I enjoyed the movie knowing that most people didn t like it and I wasn t expecting much Whenever I watch a stephen King movie I don t expect much because all his movies are awful compared to the genius of his novels I have read The Shining and Carrie and they were great books I love how Carrie played out like it was a true story and the whole book is a bunch of reports and theories and such It was so good But I noticed that both of the novels were nothing like the movies The endings were very different then the movie versions I assume from those two novels that all of his novels are changed greatly and the endings are always cheesy I ending of Thinner is the worst So Cheesy I want to read the book to find out the real ending I suggest everyone who intends to read stephen King s novels to watch his movies before hand so that you may compare And that way you will be greatly satisfied in the book I intend on doing so with all his novels that were made into movies I m sure if they were made into movies they were real good books and the screenplay went terribly wrong
The plot of The Thinner is decidedly thin And gross An obese lawyer drives over the Gypsy woman and the Gypsy curse causes him to lose and lose weight to the bone OK Gypsy curses should be entertaining but the weight losing gone bad Nope Except Stephen King thinks so And Michael McDowell other horror author and the screenwriter of this abysmal film does so too The lawyer is not only criminally irresponsible he is fat too haha The Thinner is like an immature piece of crap for a person who moans how he she has never seen anything so disgusting than fatness Hey I can only say Well look at the mirror
I was really looking forward to seeing this film but after watching it I was really disappointed The best bit was when Stephen King was in it Rober John Berk cannot act to save his life and neither can any of the others A few of the performances even made me laugh out loud The film was was not as I imagined it after reading the book which was awesome I imagined it darker and a lot scarier If i was Stephen I would be really mad br br I don t know why they changed the ending I thought the ending of the book was very good If you just found out the pie killed your daughter you wouldn t feed it to anyone else would you br br Book was so much better
Just another example of why Stepehn King s books should not be made into movies Even Carrie one of the best is ruined in the adaptation from book to screen The premise of the story revolves around a fat lawyer always on a diet who accidentally kills an old gypsy woman In court with the help of the judge and the local police chief he gets off even though the accident was sort of his fault as he was not paying attention as he was driving The father of the dead gypsy woman places a curse on the 3 with our main character Billy the lawyer getting thinner and thinner by the day Though the movie kept with the book for the most part and has your typical King ending the acting was stilted and felt forced We went from one scene to the next without much of anything in between sort of like reading acts in a play King himself made a cameo in the movie sort of like Dave Barry which reinforces my belief that authors should stay just that authors Leave the acting to actors Not that anyone in this movie was that great I ve seen the major characters in movies where they were much better
No I haven t read the Stephen King novel Thinner but I choked down the film version Horror movies are an acquired taste Regular movies give an audience a hero to applaud as he strives to achieve a goal In horror movies audiences are invited to savor the demise of characters In director Tom Holland s low fat but tasteless revenge chiller Thinner nobody wins and everybody deserves the bite that is put on them Gluttonous New England attorney Billy Halleck Robert John Burke of Robocop 3 has a weight problem Although he rocks the bathroom scales at 300 pounds he appears happily married to a trim delectable wife Heidi Lucinda Jenney of G I Jane with a yeasty teenage daughter br br Fat doesn t mean stupid here Halleck displays his sagacity in court when he wins an acquittal verdict for sleazy Mafia chieftain Richie Ginelli Joe Mantegna of House of Games Driving home from a victory feast Billy hits an old gypsy woman crossing the street and kills her A cover up occurs and Halleck s friends get him out of the soup The disgruntled gypsy father Taduz Lemke Michael Constantine of Skidoo retaliates with a curse on the corpulent lawyer and the two town officials that exonerated him Suddenly Halleck finds himself shedding pounds no matter how much chow he chomps When he begs the vengeful Gypsy to lift the curse the old man refuses Desperately Halleck resorts to Richie While Halleck struggles with the gypsies to remove the hex he learns that his loyal wife has turned his attentions to the town s hotshot doctor br br Thinner qualifies as not only laughably inept horror flick but the filmmakers also rely on stereotypes of men and women Tom Holland who directed Child s Play 1988 and scenarist Michael McDowell have served up such a slipshod script that you cannot relish watching Billy get his just dessert and shrivel up Thinner boasts few shocks and fewer surprises The filmmakers may have regurgitated King s novel but they have filleted whatever sense of horror and humor it contained Holland and McDowell introduce characters such as the Mafioso then inexplicably let them off the hook One minor character shows up long enough to die and have a chicken s head stuffed in his mouth br br The stereotypical behavior of the characters may offend audiences too Thinner depicts women as oversexed vixens and men as swine When Halleck sneaks home from a clinic he finds his doctor s sports car parked at his house His suspicions ripen into jealousy and he cooks up a scheme to get the curse transferred to this wife Even the premature ending lacks any satirical flavor Oscar winning special effects wizard Greg Cannom of Van Helsing and make up artist Bob Laden do a fabulous job beefing up actor Robert John Burke to look obese They succeed too in making him shrivel br br Only die hard Stephen King fans will be able to stomach this misogynistic gooledyspook
You ll notice that the chemist who appears in two scenes and gets to speak is played by Stephen King Don t give up your day job is the standard thing to say but that s not fair King acquits himself reasonably well he s no worse than any other member of the cast and better than most The story on the other hand is pure rubbish Please give up your day job br br Never have I seen so many dreadful performances of which the lead actor s the LEAD ACTOR S is probably the worst gathered together in the one film Everyone acts hammily but not in any entertaining way they all somehow manage to go over the top without expending or manifesting energy I blame screenwriter director Tom Holland It can t be that ALL the actors are REALLY this bad What are the odds against that Admittedly I ve never heard of any of them before but still I don t think I could walk into a talent agency and walk out with this many bad performers if I tried ONE actor despite my best efforts would turn out to have talent So what s more likely that Tom Holland rolled a dozen consecutive snake eyes or that he wrote a lousy script and then directed it poorly That would also explain why actors are bad in direct proportion to their prominence in the script The more direction an actor got the worse he performed You want me to bend over like a hunchback talk from the back of my throat show all my teeth and look bored all at the same time Okay br br This theory is confirmed by the fact that Holland undeniably managed to co write a lousy script Several writers here have commented on the fact that Billy Halleck is not a likeable character but that s a misleading way of putting it He s not a knowable character All we find out about him before the supernatural stuff starts happening is that he s fat and that all he can think about is food All I can think about is food he tells us helpfully And in the end br br Sigh I suppose I ought insert a spoiler warning here br br In the end he becomes evil Why I can only shrug Perhaps he s under some kind of enchantment Yeah that s probably it By evil perhaps I mean inexplicable it s not so much badness as a socially undesirable suspension of ordinary means end psychology Anyway his actions at the end make no sense nobody s actions make much sense and this is despite the fact that the characters do little but explain their motivation for the benefit of the audience br br By the way here s my nominee for hammiest line delivery I don t think you d like it IN FACT big dramatic pause I don t think you d like it at all
One of those Why was this made movies The romance is very hard to swallow It is one of those romances that suddenly click they are in love The movie is filled with long pauses and uncomfortable moments the drive in restaurant being the most notable Charles Grodin does a credible job but for most of the movie it s just him and Louise Lasser Ask yourself do you want to watch Grodin with his neurosis and Lasser with her neurosis together for a hour and half
This stuffy melodrama is quite easily the worst film starring Ingrid Bergman that I ve seen Even her luminous screen presence can t save this insufferably slow and meandering movie that s nearly impossible to sit through without fast forwarding a lot of it br br Only for die hard Bergman fans others are very likely to fall asleep I suggest you to watch For Whom the Bell Tolls instead
A novel by Remarque A cast that looks great on paper A left wing refugee struggling to remain in Paris between the wars A Gestapo officer undercover br br It s a pity there s no synergy here The bits and pieces never coalesce br br Stories about left wing refugees in France don t have to be this dull Read Arthur Koestler s memoir Scum of the Earth if you can find it Or his chilling Dialogue With Death ditto br br To me the only interest in this film lies in some of the incidental details br br The leads spend a lot of time drinking calvados the Norman apple brandy I welcome any prompting to have a nip of calvados myself It certainly made this film appear to pass more quickly But according to the film it s only sold in cheap low class saloons Vive le tabac parisien That s what I say References to intoxicating liquors do abound here that would seem to be a preoccupation of the scenarists br br I enjoy films set in France because it can be amusing waiting for the inevitable full size alcohol ad to pop up on a wall in the background I wasn t disappointed This time it was for Byrrh a very unusual choice This film would rate a 10 if only we were judging it on the refinement of its booze murals br br The film s indifferent score is by Louis Gruenberg Gruenberg is best known if you can call it that for his opera The Emperor Jones based on the O Neill play It premièred at roughly the same time as the film version starring Paul Robeson The opera survives today in a recording or two by Lawrence Tibbett It should surface again soon though they re running out of potentially marketable operas to revive br br Opera seems an appropriate subject to mention here since Charles Boyer s character operates under his Czech aliases Two of them are Wozzeck and Gunther both prominent roles in German opera Is that just coincidence br br Name dropping just seems to be part of this film Notice that they call up Himmelstoss on the phone Himmelstoss happens to be one of the main characters in Remarque s earlier All Quiet on the Western Front br br Well the in jokes are all in place guess there wasn t time to develop any drama
This 2003 made for TV movie was shown on a women s channel naturally As a man why do I even attempt to watch this I don t know but I should have my head examined And director and writer Simon Gornick should be ashamed of himself to give men an injustice as he does He takes away any strength and conviction a man could have by having several boring women do him in Number one bore is Joyce Hyser as the wife I couldn t wait for him to drop her Her revenge was silly and stupid and very confusing through most of the movie The other femme fatale was Nichole Hiltz about the coldest person you d ever want to meet Her looks didn t warrant our leading man to go that ape over her and her acting was so obvious only a fool could miss Definitely a loser Tembi Locke was pretty good but slow on the uptake as to the slut seducing her own husband again played as a guy who is a loser by David DeLuise Rounding out our cast of losers is Anthony Denison as a boss who has little to do but scowl at our hero Stephen Jenkins as our hero or should I say victim was not that good At first I thought he just a bad actor but later I believed it He never got the part off the ground and was repetitive throughout Although as a man I became enraged when the two women got away with it Men beware of this channel that puts men down and women get away even with murder LMN is the channel Beware Note Having watched this a second time by mistake I am convinced on my initial thoughts Especially on the writer director Simon Gornick I still believe he has disgraced the male species and should be horse whipped Only saving grace in this film is Tembi Locke who doesn t have a chance to show her talents with the awful acting of Jenkins Hyser Hiltz and DeLuise around her Plus the stupid plot that only makes it worse Down with Gornick s movie and his vacant stars in it Please LMN don t show this trite again
blows my mind how this movie got made i watched it while i worked at home writing emails and answering the phone i ONLY watched it because i hoped the revenge part would be good needless to say the revenge and the forced plot twists were not worth the emails during which they were watched in fact i m not even sure what happened at the end any more the acting was as bad as re enactment scenarios on the FBI Files show by far the worst re enactments really only Arrest and Trial can possibly be as bad at re enactments i didn t even know that the leading man was in Third Eye Blind until i looked the movie up here on IMDb but its obvious why he hasn t made any movies since i hope he is a good singer
You ve heard it said to live every moment as if it s your last Whether it s your last day or not I beg you not to waste any part of it watching this Nichole Hiltz provides some nice moments of eye candy that alas stays wrapped and David DeLuise shows why he should stick to the small screen or dog food commercials A shallow unrealistic plot with dreadful dialogue means there is no Art in the Art of Revenge br br
There is only one reason to watch this movie if you are not related to one of the stars or a producer actress Nichole Hiltz She is the show in this slow moving and wildly unlikely story of revenge Directed by Simon Gornick the film stars Joyce Hyser as a betrayed wife who decides to seek revenge on her cheatin spouse Oh but not by conventional means She plans a total guerrilla war and recruits bad girl Nichole Hiltz as her weapon of choice She wants Nichole as Tuesday to get close to her ex the handsome but dull Stephan Jenkins who should stick to music to embarrass him and ruin his life David DeLuise is good in his few brief moments and former Crime Story star Anthony Dennison is given virtually nothing to do but scowl Hiltz on the other hand comes off at various times as sexy and playful then evil and devious She also handles vulnerable and maybe a bit psychotic well She s also quite hot though there s no naughty bits show so you can understand how she might be able to get to any guy she is aimed at But the performance is kind of wasted in this movie which is just not edgy or interesting enough to recommend
An okay film with a fine leading lady but a terrible leading man Stephan Jenkins who plays the husband is a truly bad actor Joyce Hyser on the other hand is the movie s saving grace She s the best actor of the bunch br br NOTE the first comment by the fellow who heaped praise upon the movie and according to his IMDB com account has only written ONE review and guess for what movie is obviously a plant While the movie is nicely shot it s by no means subtle or great or whatever other hypobolic descriptions the reviewer used br br Art of Revenge is a fair movie but it s a big tease It offers up all manner of sexual situations but never goes through with it Like watching a Skin Flick on Cinemax but with all the naughty bits edited out br br The film as a whole is a bit unfocused and the ending and much of the third act is really a big mess There s a twist ending of course since every movie nowadays finds it necessary to have a twist ending br br A 4 out of 10 br br
The only reason I remember this movie is because it was and still is the biggest waste of time and money ever spent I was 17 and my friend was 18 We were the age when action movies were our thing to enjoy most ok 2nd most We walked out feeling so insulted we wanted our money back but the time could never be regained br br The editing is what killed this movie As the truck gets attacked by more and more vehicles with rocket launchers attached the movie completely insults the intelligence of the audience by having these rogue bad guys in 4x4 VW Bugs shooting rockets at the truck Please rockets at a truck known to be carrying plutonium What s worse is the these VW s manage to get 15 18 shots off of a 4 rocket launcher You would see on VW with 4 rockets fire 2 of them cut around the truck with the last one attached come back a second later with two rockets attached fire another then go in front of the truck and now it s back to a full set of 4 rockets br br We toughed it out hoping for a big finish that never happened It looks like they just ran out of money and stopped br br Just ridiculous
Just a warning This is the worst movie I have seen in years I couldn t watch it to the end It is a pure waste of time I really feel sorry for Snipes that he ended up in such a movie There really is not much to say about it Horrible acting incredibly bad lines story everything The only reason I would advise you to watch this movie is if you really want to see how a movie shouldn t be Just to tell you one scene the police are searching for Snipes and they are surrounding the building with helicopters and cars they are shooting around inside the building but still they are whispering so that Snipes doesn t suspect a thing
The US appear to run the UK police who all run around armed to the teeth and did you know that CID officers change into uniform when they stop work and go down the pub This has got to be one of the most unrealistic films with the worst portrayal of real UK police that has ever been foisted on the unsuspecting public I can see that Mr Snipes might have needed the money to pay his back tax bill but what the heck a good actor like Charles Dance was doing in it is a mystery br br Worse than the worse low budget B film of the 50 s An hour and a half of suicide and time I will never get back br br Avoid it like the veritable plague
haha you have to just smile and smile if you actually made it all the way through this movie it like says something about myself i guess the movie itself was created i think as some sort of psychological test or like some sort of drug to take you to a place you have never been before When Wittgenstein wrote his famous first philosophical piece the tractacus sp he said it was meaningless and useless but if you read it after you were done it would take you to a new level like a ladder and then you could throw away the work and see things with clarity and true understanding this movie is the same i think br br As a movie it is without a doubt the worst movie i have seen in a long long time in such a unique way first of all this is snipes i loved watching this guy kick ass in various movies and i have suffered through a few weak ones however although you know the movie might suck you would never suspect that it could be as bad as it actually was which is the fun of it i mean this is snipes you know it might be good but it will be alright right smile br br so this thing on every level is pure boredom pure unoriginality the reference to the professional is both dead on and obvious yet so poorly done as to be comical there is not one character in this movie that is interesting in the least and to make the whole thing more surreal they have a soundtrack that sort of sounds like parts to various Bourne identity type movies only isn t quite right in fact although it seems close to action movie background music it just so happens it is done in a manner that will grate on you fantastically br br then all the scenes in the total pitch black where honestly since the characters are so flat you don t really care whats going to happen but regardless after it happens and someone is killed you just say to yourself was i supposed to see that what else how about scenes with blinding obnoxious flashing at a strobe lights pace for a period of time that is too long to bear sure let s throw that in how bout this though when you are straining and your eyes cant handle it any longer do some more of these in the dark kills where you really don t see what happened and on top of that lets face it you don t care you were past bored way from the beginning br br so i drifted in and out a couple times but i caught almost all of this movie and it becomes something you can watch without something that engages your mind on any level therefore it becomes something you can effectively zone out with and begin to think about your life where its going where its been what we are as people br br and that that is the true magic of this film
After watching this I thought to myself there are either too few good writers directors or lots of producers br br At any rate this is a terrible movie Terrible in a way that it s not fun but rather makes you grit your teeth and quiver Makes you shout this is wrong at the movie Immersion is zero By now most of you are probably used to the terrible errors weirdness es in movies that has computers hackers etc in them This movie is like that in every aspect br br The only good thing about the movie is the little girl Emily brilliantly played by Eliza Bennett I hope she becomes big and make this thing at least worth something br br Do yourself a favor Don t watch this There is not even proper action in it Total waste of time
A lot of themes or parts of the story is the same as in Leon then other parts felt like some other movie I don t know which but there are an familiar feeling over the whole movie It was kind of nice to watch but it would have been fantastic if the story would have been more original The theme little girl bad assassin from Leon is just tweaked a little The opening scenes are really good It is strange that people like to fight in the kitchen in the movies My biggest problem was to remember which parts was from Leon Nikita and if they where from the French or American version If you have not seen Leon then this is a good movie If you liked this movie then I can recommend Leon br br Best Regards Rick
It is incredible yes someone before me wrote that it was a time wasting to seat and watch this film it is Don t do so I m totally rankled I liked Wesley Snipes and I founded funny that he played his name s meaning in a movie Anyway I wanted to see this film at home only of course but now just after I am absolutely disappointed It was his worst movie ever Inwatchable Bad actor play Bad cameraman Bad scenario Only one good think that wonderful girl Must be a manikin surely Eeeeh MB 10 lines minimum I don t want to waste you re time anymore to read my opinion I hope i was clear and under stable because English is not my native method of speaking So have grate time and see good films like i try too Peace
In the words of Charles Dance s character in this film Bollocks No plot no character development and utterly unbelievable br br Full of stuff that just doesn t happen in the real world since when were British police inspectors armed with handguns in shoulder holsters Full of mistakes Bulgarian trains in London Full of dull and artificial dialogue And the directing editing is awful wobbly hand held camera shots that add nothing to the film except a vague feeling of seasickness confusing jump cuts no structure br br Wesley Snipes character is totally unsympathetic why should we care what happens to him Direct to video Direct to the dustbin
I read in the papers that W Snipes was broke so no wonder he would take parts in low budget projects like The Contractor He is just the next action star to join a growing club the penniless action stars of the 90s Van Damme Segal Lundgren Snipes Here he stars the lead in a cheap action flick which was shot in Bulgaria we are supposed to believe that the location is London like only a complete moron would buy that The story is the one of 1000 other movies retired special forces good guy gets hired by the government again to do a wet job after that government wants to get rid of him good guy gets away after killing bad guys was that a spoiler guess not The star of the movie the little girl Eliza Bennett outperforms everybody else of the cast One star is for her plus one star for eye candy Lena Headey makes 2 stars Only for die hard Snipes fans Everybody else avoid
This film was horrible The script is COMPLETELY unrealistic yet it is written to take place in the real world the editing and lighting effects are worse than most first projects in film school br br I do not recommend this film to anyone who A knows any detail about the world of police or covert operations B knows any detail about film making or appreciation br br I do recommend this film to the average or below average mind I think it would be enjoyable if I was a dumber If you must watch this film on a full mind I highly recommend some kind of inebriation br br It is a total waste of what little production value it has
The problem with THE CONTRACTER is summed up by the opening scene The CIA want an international terrorist dead so contact black ops assassin James Dial The terrorist is appearing at the Old Bailey court in London which begs the question why do they want to bump off a terrorist if he s going to spend the rest of his life in jail He s going to be out of circulation either way Didn t the CIA have a chance before he was arrested If by some chance he gets a not guilty verdict then kill him There s no logical reason to kill someone who is going to spend life in a maximum security prison br br Since the premise sets up the story an audience might be choose to ignore the plot hole but the assination itself pours fuel upon the fire Dial s colleague is killed by a police bullet and the taxi they re driving in crashes but Dial manages to escape So the police were close enough to shoot someone but too far away to apprehend someone from a car crash The film of this type of plot connivance Later Dial finds a police inspector pointing a gun at him saying this airport is surrounded by armed coppers yet Dial manages to escape very easily without explanation The whole film cheats its audience by relying on things that are never explained This includes an important supporting character called Emily Day Why does she help Dial even though he s a wanted fugitive Your guess is as good as mine br br This is a fairly poor thriller and don t be taken in by the big name cast Wesley Snipes used to qualify as a film star but killed his career by starring in more and more inconsequental films Charles Dance also appeared in big budget Hollywood productions such as LAST ACTION HERO and ALIEN 3 but again he s someone best known for appearing in straight to DVD fare these days and he s basically playing a cameo role anyway The likes of Lena Headey may go on to become big players in cinema but they l certainly fail to put THE CONTRACTER on their resume
Don t really know where to start with one of the worst films I have had the displeasure to watch in a very long time From the setting which was quite obviously and very clear to anyone who has visited London for even 1 day will agree was not London To the much unexplained way how Snipe s character managed to escape the country back to the US without a single problem Then he convinces the girl and grandmother to visit him in America how on earth did Grandma agree to that he s an assassin Well that s the ending how about during the film well unfortunately that didn t fare much better We have British cops driving an amazing range of cars I m sure it was an eighties Vauxhall Belmont which chased the taxi after the assignation but a modern Subaru Imprezza escorting the prison van in a few scenes prior SO19 or whoever the gun toting arm of the Met they were trying to portray was happily running around the streets with their guns out chasing after Snipe s along with the CIA There were children walking around but the police were still stating they had a clear shot to shoot him does this happen in London No it doesn t I live there We also have the very implausible travel from central London to the airport let s say Heathrow for arguments sake within 5 minutes of receiving a call We also have terrible American accents a young girl who s posher than the Queen but lives in Elephant Castle What does it say for British police when helicopters and a number of officers at Snipe s location can t find Snipe s and he manages to evade capture by hiding behind some stairs The train station was obviously not even on UK soil and the fight scene sound effects were terrible The plot was also extremely poor boring and been written and filmed a lot better a thousand times before But there were a few notable actors cast in this film what were they thinking and please don t let that sway you to watch this film This film didn t seem to know what it wanted to be if you are going to concentrate on the dramatic aspects from the aftermath of an assignation then you need a strong rigid plot with plausible scenery and setting this is something the viewer has time to take in and appreciate and if you do it wrong then you notice it If you want an all out action film which this is not then continuity and scenery can be put to the side
I once used Wesley Snipes name as a clue to go ahead and watch a new untried film in which he appears So now for the first time my Snipes Method of film recommendation has failed Utterly I should first have come here to see these reviews br br Snipes ought to be ashamed to allow his otherwise earnest efforts to be so wasted in The Contractor br br One of my worst flick fears has come to bitter fruition I feared that the shaky blurry pseudo documentary unconsidered directing and editing style first brought to my attention by the Paul Greengrass directed Bloody Sunday might propagate to other films Greengass sickening style was then brought to nauseatingly new heights in the last two of the Bourne trilogy films My fear had come to pass In my opinion these films are made really bad by these motion sickness inducing methods which mistake blurry swipes for action enhancement But the Bourne Franchise as Greengrass so loving calls his cash cow apparently convinced others in Hollywood to go unprofessional in the quest for fast big bucks br br Read my lips you Hollywood types Action needs to be clearly photographed and presented not merely hinted at by poor lazy cinematographic techniques br br And The Contractor goes so far as to emulate The Bourne Ultimatum in inanely repeated sound bites in hopes their juvenile apparently evaluated audiences can t sense them For example if I hear a cop radio crackling Yankee Romeo one more time I ll just scream The chances are good I won t hear it again I certainly won t ever view The Contractor again br br I recommend to those of you who have yet to see The Contractor just be content with the tranquility this lack affords to your life br br 2 out of 10 I am tempted to lower that to a 1
STAR RATING Saturday Night Friday Night Friday Morning Sunday Night Monday Morning br br James Dial Wesley Snipes is hiding out on his ranch in Montana after failing to capture a notorious terrorist Then he s approached by the agency again to travel to London to have another go His target has been apprehended there and is under heavy police protection but they don t want him merely to capture their man they want him taken out All goes well but then the mission gets botched and when a senior police chief Windsor Charles Dance is killed the blame falls at Dial s feet Hunted like an animal he takes refuge in a nearby house and befriends a young girl named Emily Eliza Bennett who s dealing with issues of her own and becomes his unwitting sidekick as he goes about clearing his name and working out who betrayed him br br This latest Snipes straight to DVD escapade came out of nowhere with a minimal of publicity even for something so small time I don t recall seeing any advertisements or trailers for it anywhere With this in mind and after Snipes s history of duff DVD efforts this might have seemed like one which Snoop Dawg would tell you to drop like it s hot But I felt compelled to give it a go anyway It doesn t rank among his worst but it doesn t reach any higher than the standards of some of his better ones The Detonator 7 Seconds says it all really either br br This is at best mildly suspenseful with a minimal of action naff all in the way of cool dialogue and Snipes not exactly at his best in the lead role Likewise in a main supporting role it s quite clear Dance has only showed up for the pay cheque as well and this is generally one that none of the cast are going to shout for the hills about on any of their CVs br br It says a lot that by the end the only contract that s keeping you interested is when Snipes s will end with Sony and with it an end to any further sub par EL DVD action films
Wesley Snipes is James Dial an assassin for hire agent of the CIA and pure bad ass special operative During his free time Dial dons a cowboy hat and breeds horses with macho names such as Beauty br br Enter agent Collins his supervising officer Enter a new assignment kill a terrorist that is in UK custody Of course the United Kingdom being an allied state is a great place for covert ops and head shots outside of courtrooms br br The assassination is a big success apart from the fact that the escape plan blew So Dial s partner and local liaison gets killed in action trying to escape the police whilst Dial becomes hot property with the London coppers trying to get to him and CIA trying to dispose of him br br Fortunately for Dial the safe house is routinely visited by a teenager Emily Day Eliza Bennett who loves hanging out with cold blooded killers with arrest warrants and help them escape from the evil UK law enforcement br br With a script like that need I say more On the plus side Wesley Snipes is Wesley Snipes be that a pro or a con and the movie is quite engaging On the minus editing is very disjointing and has a hurl effect on the stomach
I wouldn t call it awful but nothing at all shines in this movie and it is encumbered with some seriously unbelievable basic plot development It starts out well but once the main hit is done it devolves into a long subplot around a young girl which is not compelling and some action scenes which are theatre of the absurd unrealistic For example there is a prolonged shootout at the airport in which the lighting is all stroboscopic No explanation for that How credible is it that a airport storage area is going to have lights that flash on and off confusingly and just enough to let Snipes do his incredible escape schtick This is one of far too few action scenes punctuated by pointlessly drawn out set ups that just fails to draw one into suspending belief br br In addition the whole premise seems to be that the United States CIA team can shoot the place up but get away with it by saying national security to the Brits This gimmick relies on a stereotype that is to far afield from reality to be satisfying br br There are a lot better action movies out there Better formulated better executed This one is entertaining at times but there is just not enough meat on the bone and after a while it becomes downright boring something that should never happen in a good action movie
Have previously enjoyed Wesley Snipes in several action flicks and I had expected a lot more even from a score of 5 8 IMDb the movie fails to entertain and even though the story is thin and unoriginal the acting is most unfortunately thinner and goes to mimic a worst case scenario of playing strong feelings accompanied by some bad acting Don t waist your time this movie ísnt entertaining if you wanna cry it might suffice though even though your tears will be wept due to seeing Wesley Snipes in the tragic action film wannabe comedy br br I give this 2 10 it really was awful if you wanna see a decent movie go see shooter or rent it its all the good things this movie isn t

As far as I am concerned this silent version of The Merry Widow is the worst version ever made There is no tenderness or love or spirituality about this version it is all macabre Germanic sinister nonsense It reminded me of Nazis falling in love who cares br br This silent version by von Stroheim is not a faithful adaptation of the original story In this one we have leering John Gilbert and his gross relative the Prince lusting after this silly American actress played by Mae Murray possessed with a modern permed hairstyle and implausible feminist manner that threw me off again and again I like my romances light and beautiful with slow build ups not harsh and sadistic like this one And come on those bee stung lips get rid of them girl br br Go see a live performance of the show if you would like to get a real idea of the sweetness of the original operetta by Franz Lehar Failing that wait till TCM shows the Jeanette MacDonald Maurice Chevalier sound version It s much better

I m shocked that there were people who liked this movie I saw it at Tribeca and most of the audience laughed through it at scenes that were not meant to be funny I felt bad because the lead actress was in the audience but honestly the plot to this movie needed MAJOR revision it didn t even make sense one second the characters question what exactly it is that they re snorting the next scene they re hopelessly addicted and figure out how to make it Also the ending just took the cake I m not going to spoil the magnificent conclusion but it pretty much blended right in with the rest of the horrible plot script see this movie for comedy if you must
Tasteless I can t even write intelligently about the movie I laughed the entire movie It wasn t supposed to be funny Matt Farnsworth has no clue what he is doing His story is written it seems without any knowledge of Iowa culture and the meth problem I know Farnsworth is from Iowa which makes his movie even more puzzling to me Why do the two main characters have accents It doesn t make any sense The acting was mediocre at best and at times hard to watch Gratituous violence and sex filled the movie I am guessing that the violence and sex were supposed to make the movie edgy but it came across as unbelievable and offensive The ending of the movie is so brilliantly bad that all I could do was laugh and look at the rolling credits with disbelief As I walked out of the theatre everyone else who was leaving was laughing along with me The ending of the movie was meant to evoke tears but it did the exact opposite Do not waste your time on this horrible movie unless you want to see ignorant sappy overacted clichéd drivel
This movie made me really mad because the main characters or all the characters have a southern accent I ve lived in Iowa for 29 years and I know that people don t have a southern accent here This movie is about a guy who does meth and I don t know the real plot or what the movie is suppose to be about It has some pretty graphic drug use in it and it s really insulting so see these people use meth like it was sugar I lost my brother to meth and this movie makes me sick to my stomach because it glamorizes the drug The movie makes it look cool to use the drug but I was happy at the end when the guy almost made it across the state line I also know that most women who experience a traumatic rape don t want to make love to their boyfriend or husband the next day The movie is just wrong in all directions I would suggest The Basketball Diaries if I was going to suggest a movie about drugs
The week before I saw Iowa I saw Art School Confidential in which a pretentious student makes a film and can t decide whether he wants it to be art or violent exploitation Iowa could be the film that he made I can see elements of much better movies in Iowa Spun and Natural Born Killers However in addition to artiness both those movies had good character development and coherent story lines Iowa This movie stumbles to a preposterous end I have to admit that it had consistency This movie is bad from beginning to end and not particularly worse or better in any part The actors all did what they could Roseanna Arquette deserves better She demonstrates that she is very talented very funny and very sexy But why does she have to demonstrate it in this turd ball
Well I don t think the picture is as bad as most of the reviews make it out to be but there s no denying that it s got problems br br Mostly the problems are in the script There s a plot but not much story and certainly not one that anybody could call plausible it trots out any number of self consciously strange and or stereotypical characters lines moments what have you and by the end it just hasn t added up to much in this department br br Sorry but I couldn t care less about whatever social ill Farnsworth might be trying to address there will always be a sector of the population willing to do just about anything to shred their brains even if it requires running around corn fields trying to steal ammonia or whatever it is those morons do So as a film you won t find me calling Iowa important But at a stylistic level the picture is more than interesting and some of Farnsworth s choices in depicting a meth head s wigged out state are beautiful hilarious disturbing and yes I m going to say it inspired br br The acting is uneven but that just may be a casualty of the afore praised stylistic reaching Look Rosanna Arquette is a fine actress but she s not very good here so a discriminating audience member does have to ask What happened It s weird that Diane Foster manages a simplicity and grace that so few of the other actors can come anywhere near For example I might seriously consider whatever explanation Farnsworth could provide for Michael T Weiss s over the top turn as a probation officer but I doubt I d ever buy it It Just Doesn t Work br br Then again it s the most alive and in the moment that I ve seen John Savage appear in years So go figure br br This is the sort of work that tantalizes but does not promise and that s okay neither Farnsworth nor anyone else is required to make movies So whether or not Farnsworth has another film in him remains to be seen but if he does it seems pretty likely that it won t be bland pap In an age when people are planning their lives around the latest installment of American Idol perhaps we could allow not scorn Farnsworth s legitimate and undeniably flawed film br br What is more perhaps we could welcome not berate his energetic and sometimes blessedly idiosyncratic imagination
Iowa wants to be Requiem for a Dream for Midwest meth but it comes across as a hard R rated Reefer Madness br br Yes drugs are bad and meth is horribly pernicious as an addiction and how it destroys people families and communities But these characters who are either dumb or ridiculous and the eye rolling plot won t teach that lesson to anyone br br While writer director star Matt Farnsworth has some charisma on screen his partner Diane Foster plays a wincibly silly wide eyed innocent corrupted by drugsas was already satirized by Susan Sarandon in The Rocky Horror Picture Show I really felt sorry for her for all the totally unnecessary nudity she was put through It wasn t until the end of the film that I realized I was supposed to think these two were recent high school graduates to explain some of their naiveté as we are bombarded by their school photos but if so they even looked older than the folks on The O C While they have good chemistry on screen they are a pale imitation of a Badlands type couple br br The guest stars are badly used Michael T Weiss who was so good in TV s The Pretender is completely ludicrous as a corrupt parole officer and his brutal violence is just plain crazy as his character pretty much ruins any social significance for the film Rosanna Arquette has to be even sleazier than she rolled around for David Cronenberg as a very low rent Livia Soprano John Savage even has to mouth the old baby boomer excuses about I did pot but this is worse A Goth chick shows up with the odd explanation that she s a stripper from Des Moines The obligatory Latino drug dealer appears in Iowa br br With a limited budget the interior view of meth use is portrayed quite vividly with quite scary hallucinations We certainly see them go crazy br br While the Iowa locations are used very well including an amusing scene of a propane gas robbery the accents and church references are confusingly Southern Baptist Guns seem to be used by law abiding and law breaking citizens here more than in any inner city drug dealing movie br br The songs of Iowa s best known bard Greg Brown are used throughout but oddly are not listed in the credits I hope they were used with permission br br I caught this at its commercial run in NYC because I missed it at the Tribeca Film Festival where it got considerable and inexplicable buzz
The often reliable Leonard Maltin says this is a delightful romance and that Sanders is superb Maltin must have confused this movie with something else Sanders is snide and droll and superb as usual you can imagine his delivery of the line regarding adultery Sometimes the chains of matrimony are so heavy they have to be carried by three but dull wooden and dated describe this movie more accurately The storyline itself an autobiography with Sanders as a suave jewel thief Francois Eugene Vidocq who becomes chief of police but can hardly resist the lure of fine jewels is entertaining enough but it has the same kind of hollow historical Hollywood treatment that marred such period epics as Marie Antoinette and certainly the deplorable Forever Amber which screams for a classy remake Though in his defense Sanders tries mightily to add some depth to his character it is all for naught I am an unabashed Douglas Sirk fan but this is 1946 and it is one of Sirk s earliest American efforts lacking many of the signature touches that would define his florid breast heaving potboilers Sirk is just getting his feet wet here and made a number of unmemorable films over the next ten years until he struck gold with Magnificent Obsession and hit his stride bombarding us with such estrogen fests as All That Heaven Allows Written on the Wind and Imitation of Life But Scandal In Paris is hardly his best work a relatively low budget affair with cheesy sets and ineffective costuming
Positively awful George Sanders vehicle where he goes from being a thief to police czar br br While Sanders was an excellent character actor he was certainly no leading man and this film proves it br br It is absolutely beyond stupidity Gene Lockhart did provide some comic relief until a moment of anger led him to fire his gun with tragedy resulting br br Sadly George Sanders and co star Carol Landis committed suicide in real life After making a film as deplorable as this it is not shocking br br The usual appealing Signe Hasso is really nothing here
his costume drama is ill cast and without charm br br George Sanders was a superb character actor But he is thoroughly implausible here as the lead an Eighteenth Century rogue known for his philosophy and great good looks His costar is of all people Akim Tamiroff Some Frenchman Then there s Signe Hasso in a dark wig as the virginal daughter of a wealthy family Carole Landis fares best The movie opens with her in silhouette She is a soubrette and a naughty girl at that She disappears for a while but turns up in an improbably situation But she s good She was always an appealing actress Here she is cast closest to her usual type of role br br It s meant to be a little naughty kind of ooh la la It ought to have had a light touch but it s a leaden affair from start to finish
This crew versus monsta has been done a hundred times sometimes better This one was pretty slow moving only the monster s resurrection was really worthwhile Attempts at character developments gets botched by routine Yeah routine is the word Went straight to video in France No wonder
I really can t say anything bad or good about this thing Its characters are likable enough it s capably produced and designed and professional looking except for that cheesy monster suit However it has no originality no ideas and nothing you haven t seen in ALIEN PREDATOR ARMAGEDDON and or OUTLAND It s just another formula cookie cutter grimy corporate drones in deep space versus unstoppable monster flick Pretty much a waste of time
After finally viewing this movie in its entirety I am completely mystified by the adoration it has received by critics and online users alike Is it the worst Western ever No I wouldn t say that But the last great American Western a phrase I saw applied to it more than once Not even close br br A movie that tries to tell a story like this needs believable characters that speak believable dialogue and the dialogue in this film is among the most hackneyed and clichéd that I ve ever seen The movie can be measured in groaners per minute as in how many times is an actor or actress forced by the script to say something that no human being would say in real life There s so many instances of this that it s distracting Cheesy lines come at you in waves predictable unoriginal and often br br If bad dialogue doesn t bother you then how about bad gunfights Few Westerns can show you gunfighting that s completely unbelievable while desperately trying to make you take the action seriously It s okay if there s a comic edge to such gunfighting such as in Silverado but in Tombstone the very staged and very stiff choreography of the early gunplay is just another reason to leave this movie off the list of good Westerns The final showdown somewhat redeems the director on this score but by then I was so disinterested in the movie that it was beyond saving br br Other than those flaws I can say the visuals are stunning the movie s well shot and the settings all look great The acting is passable especially considering what the actors were given to work with However if you re looking for the last great American Western do yourself a favor go rent Unforgiven instead br br 3 out of 10
The fact that I did not like the music is a very personal opinion the historical innacuracies are not I do realize that it is an opera and not a documentary but some important aspects are missing especiallly if other people comment falsely because of it br br Abbu Abas was the mastermind of this operation which was staged and reorganized due to discovery on board the shiph in order to free 50 terrorists from Israeli prisons one of which was Samir Kuntar a heinous terrorist whose story you can find by searching for klinghoffer samir kuntar on google Abbu Abbas was responsible for many other terrorist operations even if he never set foot on the Achile Lauro Ben Laden never set foot on the planes that hit the WTC did he br br possible spoilers br br The movie almost excuses the terrorists actions and reactions because of horrors they might have lived always accentuating and exaggerating how much the Israeli s have done to hurt them However they never portray the hurt that the Palestinians have ever caused to the Israelis The movie uses quite horrid images from the Sabra and Chatila horror and nothing is said understating the general belief that it was Israel who was responsible without ever mentioning that it was a Syrian les Lebanese army who conducted the massacre br br The acting was generally very bad but I guess that s what can be expected from opera singers br br On another note I am shocked at how a person can excuse terrorists killing a hostage because the hostage tried to stir the 400 innocent hostages against the armed terrorists and add that the person should not be considered sympathetic because he is a supporter of zionism Imagine how unsympathetic his wife was spitting on the terrorists who shot her husband and threw his body into the sea I hope no one in the world is as cruel as she is wink wink
Well this film has certainly had a fair amount of hype From the buzz at the Toronto Film Festival to gushing reviews on CBC Radio A refreshing wacky hilarious indie movie apparently I d been looking forward to it for months br br How can I put it this simply It sucked in a very big way An exercise in cinematic lameness that makes Adam Sandler look like a comic genius br br At best it was mildly amusing and at worst coma inducing An amerterish script badly directed and shoddily edited into a ramshackle mess br br And what was with the music being 500db louder than the rest of the sound track That was about the only truly odd thing about it br br If you want to see a genuinely funny bizarre movie involving aliens then try Repoman There is no comparison
Although it got some favorable press after playing at the Toronto Intl Film Festival there were a number of reasons not to expect too much from this One it s an ultra low budget Canadian film Two it s written directed and starring the same person usually a bad sign unless it s Woody Allen George Clooney or one or two other respected filmmakers But despite my watching it with lowered expectations it still turned out to a far bigger disappointment than I thought possible br br In a nutshell bad script bad acting terrible directing Don t waste your time or money on this turkey It claims to be a comedy but I only laughed twice Plus there is awful music blaring throughout How this got any attention I ll never know
This movie has got to be one of the worst I have ever seen make it to DVD The story line might have clicked if the film had more funding and writers that would have cut the nonsense and sickly scenes that I highly caution parents on But the story line is like a loose cannon If there was such a thing as a drive thru movie maker this one would have sprung from that It reminded me a lot of the quickie films that were put out in the 1960 s poor script writing and filming br br The only sensible characters in the whole movie was the bartender and beaver The rest of the film could have easily been made by middle school children I give this film a rating of 1 as it is truly awful and left my entire family with a sense of being cheated My advice Don t Watch It
Phil the Alien is one of those quirky films where the humour is based around the oddness of everything rather than actual punchlines br br At first it was very odd and pretty funny but as the movie progressed I didn t find the jokes or oddness funny anymore br br Its a low budget film thats never a problem in itself there were some pretty interesting characters but eventually I just lost interest br br I imagine this film would appeal to a stoner who is currently partaking br br For something similar but better try Brother from another planet
the guy who wrote directed and stared in this shocking piece of trash should really consider a carer change Yes Rob Stefaniuk i mean you Seriously who funded this crap there are so many talented writers out there whom money could be better spent on I think the idea is great but the acting script and directing is just plain awful The jokes are so not funny I understand that they are supposed to be taking the mickey BUT do it with style this movie is screaming 1995 Saturday night live skits Why I say again why do studios give money to hacks like Rob Stefaniuk NEVER GIVE A COMEDIAN THE Opportunity TO WRITE DIRECT AND STAR IN HIS OWN MOVIE DUH
When HEY ARNOLD first came on the air in 1996 I watched it It was one of my favorite shows Then the same episodes started getting shown over and over again so I got tired of waiting for new episodes and stopped watching it I was sort of surprised when I heard about HEY ARNOLD THE MOVIE since it doesn t seem to be nearly as popular as some of the other Nickelodeon cartoons like SPONGEBOB SQUAREPANTS Nevertheless having nothing better to do I went to see the movie anyway Going into the theater I wasn t expecting much I was just expecting it to be a dumb movie version of a childrens cartoon like the RECESS movie was I guess I got what I expected It was a dumb kiddie movie and nothing more There were some good parts here and there but for the most part the movie was a stinker Simply for kids
I like animated shows I enjoy the Nick fare pretty much including Hey Arnold But moving a TV show to the Big Screen isn t easy and this just didn t feel big enough It was more like a long episode of the show and it just didn t move along that well Judging by the behavior of the kids we had with us it didn t score that well with them either
tries to be funny and fails miserably The animation is just terrible looks like a 2 year old threw it together in his sleep Plot is dull and cliched IF you have a young child maybe rent it but don t waste hard earned money to pay to see it br br 1 10
I have to admit that I m a great fan of this show so you must know how disappointed I got when I watched this movie First of all the plot was awful I thought it was going to be something more interesting like to see what happened to Arnold fathers or something more interesting but NOOOOOOO a maniac wants to destroy Arnold s house between many other places so many people tries to stop this br br I must admit that the plot wasn t so bad after all but what really sucked were the steps that Arnold and his friends do to stop this maniac they become friends of a spy they drive a bus based on a video game for God sake and to worse everything they make super moves on the bus things that many persons had already tried and died but not Arnold Gerald and Helga cause they are experts on a video game br br Honestly my mom my sister even me got really disappointed after watching this movie cause it was the worst way to finish a really good cartoon I must admit that I used to enjoy Hey Arnold it was one of my favorite cartoons on Nickelodeon but after this crap of movie I m not quite sure if I m going to watch Hey Arnold as I used to watch it on the past br br Other thing Nickelodeon with that enormous number of dynamite I can assure you that not a simple street would explode I think that the whole city could explode with that oh and please if all of your future movies from good cartoons are going to be like that don t do more movies you give a bad critic to cartoons that used to be good br br Honestly I think this was the worst way to end this show a good show transformed into this crap of movie
this is a great movie I love the series on tv and so I loved the movie One of the best things in the movie is that Helga finally admits her deepest darkest secret to Arnold that was great i loved it it was pretty funny too It s a great movie Doy
Only children below the age of 12 should be allowed to see this film The rest of us should take a book MP3 player or just take a nice nap to endure the experience of this event This can be best summed up as a blown up TV movie being distributed into theaters Children will want to see this film and they will like and be amused by the movie
Hey Arnold is a slow paced and slightly boring movie The plot is not very creative The Paul Sorvino character Shenk is buying all of the decrepit low priced buildings in order to build a gigantic mall shopping complex and office buildings This plot goes back to many 1960s kids movies It is boring Paul Sorvino is not very exciting either so the idea of him as the bad guy is not very scary Gramps remembers something about a historical document and the rest of the movie is about the last 36 hours when Arnold and Jamal must find the document with the undercover aid of Helga whose father is hoping to become rich thanks to Shenk s Mall The kids must move around town on buses and so the exciting chase scene involving a bus is not only silly but underscores how this movie is written for very young kids Hey Arnold the TV cartoon is usually very entertaining and it has enough humor to appeal to adults The TV cartoon is usually faster paced and more imaginative than this movie Hey Arnold the movie is about five times more sedated and a good way to put anyone including kiddies to sleep Hey Arnold was a tough one to stay awake all the way until the predictable and totally boring ending If you want to send your kids to a totally non offensive movie this is it I get the feeling that instead of trying to make a 90 minute movie the producers started out with a 30 minute TV cartoon script and tried to expand it into 90 minutes This Mall Story definitely could have been covered in the TV cartoon Hopefully Arnold will bet a better writer if there is ever a sequel
I saw this movie with low expectations and was not disappointed Its so bad that it is actually funny in a very cringe worthy way br br Gael is absolutely terrible I mean he just cannot act period He should give up now as acting is clearly not his thing His co stars are about the same caliber i m sure my 5 year old cousin could do a better job than all of them The director should be ashamed to have put his name on something so ridiculous Somehow I don t think an Oscar is on the cards for this guy br br I have never written a comment on IMDb but this movie was so bad I felt compelled to do so br br If you get the chance to see this film don t 0 10 if there was a 0
For those looking for a sequel for the fine South African miniseries of the 1980s this isn t it Nor is it a historical drama Rather it is a dreary little fantasy which has nothing to do with the historical Shaka but merely uses his name to give a certain cachet to Sinclair s idiotic story about an African superhero who is a combination of Jesus Lincoln Superman and Nelson Mandela br br On the other hand there are a few laugh out loud moments as when Shaka breaks the cross to which he is chained and kicks some serious slaver butt You know like Jesus would have done if he hadn t been such a wimp br br True I saw only the 98 minute version but I can t imagine that twice as much of this crap would have been better br br And what kind of a name is Mungo
Amen to Magsel There was a lot of confusion going on First off how do you know which movie you are purchasing Henry Cele stars in every one of them I bought this movie thinking it was the miniseries WHAT A LETDOWN It would have been a comedy but for the young girl being raped David Hasselhoff spelling is OK for popcorn TV but he was not believable in this film where was his English accent AND WHAT S WITH THE LOVE STORY The movie was supposed to be about a young man s rise to military power not the slave ship captain getting jiggly with the English maiden looking for her daddy br br If I had paid more than 7 for this movie I would have to call the police because that would be a crime
Complete drivel An unfortunate manifestation of the hypocritical toxic culture of a decade ago In this movie pedestrian regrets for slavery go hand in hand with colonialist subtexts the annoying redhead feeding Shaka rice Forget historical reality too Didn t most western slaves comes from West Africa An American slaver easily capturing Shaka with a handful of men Finally David Hasslehoff could not have been any more obnoxious One can only ponder how would he have fared in the miniseries Promptly impaled most likely The miniseries was superb and it is unfortunate that DH should have gotten his hands on something unique and made it mundane I tend to think that he had hand in creating this fiasco
As a South African it s an insult to think that someone was actually paid to produce this nonsense br br Despite the fact that the director was one of the writers for the original Shaka Zulu mini this addition to the series is appalling The original series was based on historical facts about a man who was a great strategist leader and warrior A man who played a large role in shaping the history of local tribes in South Africa br br The plot of this film however is nothing but hogwash scraped from the bottom of the barrel by a writer that has failed to impress since the mid nineties br br While Omar Sharif and Henry Cele are good actors what is David Hasselhoff doing here rescuing drowning slaves with his red buoy and bleached smile br br I kept expecting blond busty women to appear out of nowhere and run across the screen in their tiny red bathing suits for no apparent reason Not that this would ve been any more bizarre than the fantastical plot line that was probably dreamed up after 10 pints of beer at a fancy dress party where someone s caveman costume inspired the writer to return to an African theme for his next blockbuster
Yes I ll admit it I believed all the hype surrounding this piece of work about the trials and tribulations of 6 people living in Mexico City concerning their sexual lives And so I was really expecting to finally see a Mexican movie in ages that was both popular and interesting to watch Unfortunately the film was utterly disappointing The story presents us with two couples both with very obvious marital problems When a third party comes into the life of each couple their problems reach a pivotal point Or absolute absurd The plot then turns into a battle of the sexes The stance taken by each group yes they literally group girls with girls and boys with boys is blatantly stupid and childish I guess the humor was supposed to be there And it all goes from bad to worse The performances range from good Miss Zavaleta to mediocre Mr Bichir with Serrano doing an acceptable job on his opera prima However the flat circumstances that make up the plot the one dimensional characters the very poor if not stupid perception of what sex represents in a mature relationship etc make the movie fail Miserably SPyL has had an impressive good reception at the box office Believe the hype at your own risk
I have to say I was really looking forward on watching this film and finding some new life in it that would separate it from most dull and overly crafted mexican films I have no idea why but I trusted Sexo Pudor y Lagrimas to be the one to inject freshness and confidence to our non existent industry Maybe it was because the soundtrack which I listened to before I saw the film sounded different from others maybe it was because it dared to include newer faces apart from Demian Bichir who is always a favorite of mexican film directors and supposedly dealed within it s script with modern social behaviour maybe because it s photography I saw in the trailers was bright and realistic instead of theatrical The film turned out to be a major crowd pleaser and a major letdown What Serrano actually deals here with is the very old fashioned battle of the sexes as in all men are the same and why is it that all women blah blah blah Nothing new in it not even that it uses so much common ground and clichè that it eventually mocks itself without leaving any valuable reflexion on the female male condition Full of usual tramps on the audience like safe gags about the clichès I talked about before those always work always and screaming performances it is a well acted film in it s context and by screaming I mean literally The at first more compelling characters played by Monica Dionne and Demian Bichir turn out to be according to Serrano the more pathetic ones I completely disagree with Serrano they shouldn t have been treated that way only to serve as marionettes for his lesson to come through he made sure we got HIS message and completely destroyed their roles that were the only solid ground in which this story could have stood Anyway it is after all a very entertaining film at times and you will probably have a good time seeing it if you accept to be manipulated by it
You know what you are getting when you purchase a Hallmark card A sappy trite verse and that will be 3 99 thank you very much You get the same with a Hallmark movie Here we get a ninety year old Ernie Borgnine coming out of retirement to let us know that as a matter of fact he is not dead like we thought Poor Ernie he is the poor soul that married Ethel Merman several years ago and the marriage lasted a few weeks In this flick Ernie jumps in feet first and portrays the Grandpa that bonds with his long lost grandkid We have seen it before You might enjoy this movie but please don t say that you were not warned
It s difficult to know where this adaptation starts going wrong because I think the problem begins with the books themselves Alexander McCall Smith has worked out that you read them not for the detective stories but for his deeply condescending and completely spurious vision of an Africa that does not exist He s done for Botswana what Borat did for Kazakhstan not as successfully but based in as much fact br br Once I realised this it ceased to gall me that Jill Scott an American singer actress is cast as Mma Ramotswe If she is to represent a land that is not Africa how appropriate that she is a black woman who is not African She s not the only American on the cast Mma Makutsi is played by Anika Noni Rose Both women are far far too young for the roles they re playing and far too glamorous Both brutally murder the local accents and both focus so entirely on this brutality that they fail to offer much in the way of acting Scott s Mma Ramotswe is bouncy cute and soft Rose s Mma Makutsi is an annoying motor mouthed bitch br br The result is almost unwatchable The principal cast is redeemed only by the presence of Lucian Msamati who turns in a decent performance as Mr JLB Matekoni Hes comes off smarter and more intense than in the books but I find myself unable to blame Msamati for this he s a shining light in an ocean of suckage The contradictions between his performance and the books are clearly laid at the feet of whichever committee of butchers wrote the script br br To me McCall Smith s writing has always been highly entertaining yet notoriously bad He refuses to be edited As a result his books contain experiments in grammar that border on the scientific and characters that change name mid sentence It is therefore something of an achievement that the writing team on this project actually made it worse br br The dialogue is now largely Anglicised Characters speak of opening up and sensitivity to needs Mma Ramotswe and Mr JLB Matekoni flirt openly Mma Makutsi moans about not having a computer but given her constantly restyled hair makeup and jewellery I m surprised she doesn t have a MacBook in her handbag along with her Visa card br br So what are we left with here It s difficult to be upset with this crappy adaptation because honestly most of the things I like about the original books are apocryphal anyway McCall Smith paints a fictional Botswana populated with cute non threatening black people who are full of amusing and palatable wisdom nuggets It reads well despite linguistic travesty but it is a vision of how a certain type of white person wishes black people were It just isn t true br br Given that it s hardly surprising that this show sucks as much as it does It remains to be seen whether European and American audiences will even notice however
I had somewhat high hopes for this since I like Tim Roth I was not pleased with this film I liked the Ang Lee The Hulk a few years back so I figured this would have more of a bang to it First I was very disappointed with John Hurt s performance here He looks as if his eyebrows were re shaped for this His performance was not convincing He was not as good as one would expect Tim Roth is cool as always here The Gama thing didn t really stick to the original story line I don t think I guess the best part of the film was the end It had some cool action The only problem with the original was that it was too long This one is not as long but it got a bit boring at times I remember some time ago when Walmart had this movie really cheap for sale and I always wondered why Now I know I was hoping to to get blown away but I was not
This reboot is like a processed McDonald s meal compared to Ang Lee s very good but very underrated 2003 The Incredible Hulk br br Ang Lee s The Hulk is a comic book movie for the thinking person The Hulk takes some time to appear about 40 minutes but when he does we see the conflict at our protagonist s core He does his best to avoid losing control but as he admits when he does give in to his rage he likes it br br Now compare this to Edward Norton s turn where there is no display of conflict in his personality and he turns into the Hulk whenever he becomes excited and his pulse rate hits 200 beats per minute not 183 not 197 but exactly 200 To this reviewer this felt akin to the introduction of midi chlorians in The Phantom Menace which tell how strong the force is with one as if mystical abilities can be gauged through a blood test In the 2008 movie all Ed Norton s Bruce Banner has to do is to keep his pulse rate under 200 as monitored by a device strapped onto his wrist And for the record it is extremely difficult to get one s pulse rate up to 200 even through a very exhilarating run especially for a physically fit person br br Emotions drive Eric Bana s Hulk He has repressed memories of his mother s death and his father s role in his early life On the surface he is calm but there underneath there is significant anger enough rage to fuel the Hulk when it is unleashed But the Hulk never kills intentionally even his attackers Mostly he just wants to get away or close to Betty Ross Jennifer Connelly He incapacitates his shooters and in one critical scene saves a fighter jet pursuing him from a collision br br In the 2003 movie the visual effects are there but as necessary The action scenes and there are plenty of them are necessary to the plot unlike the 2008 movie where action is inserted for the sake of action br br In his quest to turn it into a fugitive story Ed Norton loses focus on how Bruce Banner feels about the Hulk To him the Hulk is a dangerous side effect of an experiment went awry And Louis Leterrier the director picking up on Ed Norton s cue fails to add any emotional dimension to the Banner Hulk relationship The story can be summed up as Banner is pursued and Hulk kicks butt Banner is pursed and Hulk kick butt Repeat as necessary br br The only thing that went against the 2003 movie is that it is perhaps not as true to the comic books as the 2008 version However even as I am a fan of the comics I would prefer a movie that is not as true to the comics as a fanboy s dream but has heart over the comics loyal but manufactured and soulless 2008 version any day br br Perhaps Ang Lee should have read more comics Iron Man also released in 2008 is a perfect example of a movie that is true to its comic book roots and has heart
Somebody owes Ang Lee an apology Actually a lot of people do And I ll start I was never interested in the Ang Lee film Hulk because of the near unanimous bad reviews Even the premium cable channels seemed to rarely show it I finally decided to watch it yesterday on USA network and wow br br SPOILERS FOR ANG LEE S HULK AND THE INCREDIBLE HULK br br Was it boring I almost didn t make it through Ang Lee s Hulk Eric Bana was expressionless Nick Nolte was horrible Sam Elliott was unlikeable and that s no fun he s usually a cool character In fact I honestly think they chose Eric Bana because his non descript face was the easiest to mimic with computer graphics and it was clear that the Ang Lee Hulk was meant to facially resemble Bruce Banner in his non angry state When Hulk fought a mutant poodle I was ready to concede Hulk as the worst superhero movie ever br br But then something happened About 3 4 of the way through this tedious movie there was a genuinely exciting and dare I say it reasonably convincing extended action scene that starts with Hulk breaking out of a containment chamber in a military base fighting M1 tanks and Comanche helicopters in the desert then riding an F22 Raptor into the stratosphere only to be captured on the streets of San Francisco This was one of the best action sequences ever made for a superhero movie And I have to say the CGI was quite good That s not to say that the Hulk was totally convincing But it didn t require much more suspension of disbelief than is required in a lot of non superhero action movies And that s quite a feat br br Of course the ending got really stupid with Bruce Banner s father turning into some sort of shape shifting villain but the earlier long action sequence put any of Iron Man s brief heroics to shame And overall apart from the animated mutant dogs it really did seem like the CGI in Hulk tried hard to convince you that he was real and really interacting with his environment It was certainly better than I expected br br OK but what about The Incredible Hulk Guess what It s boring too It has just a few appearances by the Hulk and here s the thing the CGI in this movie is horrible Maybe the Hulk in Ang Lee s version looked fake at times and cartoonish at others but it had its convincing moments also The Incredible Hulk looked positively ridiculous It had skin tone and muscle tone that didn t even look like a living creature just some sort of computer generated texture It was really preposterous The lighting environment and facial effects didn t look 5 years newer than Ang Lee s they looked 10 years older And there really is no excuse for that We truly are living in an era where computer programmers can ruin a movie just as thoroughly as any director actor or cinematographer ever could br br Worse the writer and director of this movie seemed to learn almost nothing from Ang Lee s failure All the same mistakes are made Bruce Banner is practically emotionless The general is so relentlessly implausibly one dimensional that he seems faker than the Hulk The love interest is unconvincing I have to give Liv Tyler credit for being more emotional than Jennifer Connelly though both are quite easy on the eyes Tim Blake Nelson overacts almost as much as Nick Nolte even though he s only in the movie for a few minutes The Hulk really doesn t do much in this movie certainly not any more than in Ang Lee s version The Incredible Hulk was slightly more fast paced but since nothing really happened anyway that s not worth much Oh yeah the villain is every bit as phony looking as the Hulk He s actually much more interesting as a human than as a monster br br This is how I can definitively say Ang Lee s version was better if I ever have the chance to see Ang Lee s version again I might be able to sit through it to see the good action sequences or else to try to appreciate the dialogue a little more more likely I d just fast forward to the good parts But there is absolutely not a single scene in The Incredible Hulk that is worth seeing once let alone twice It is truly at the bottom of the heap of superhero movies The cartoonish CGI is an insult to the audience at least in Ang Lee s version it seems like they were trying to make it realistic except for the giant poodle of course br br It is absolutely mind boggling how the filmmakers intended to erase the bad feelings associated with Ang Lee s Hulk by making almost exactly the same movie br br It is to Edward Norton s credit that he seems to be distancing himself from this film
P or Club P should really be called L for lame Every festival has a disappointment and this is the one that fails to live up to its much hyped logline Thai lesbians fighting monsters Rather this is the tale of a Khmer country girl who s grandmother has taught her a little witchcraft along with a few odd but specific rules don t walk under a clothesline don t eat raw meat and don t accept money for your powers Well guess what folks the girl moves to Bangkok to raise some money as a bar girl and manages to break all the rules granny taught her which subsequently releases an evil spirit that conveniently kills the foreign johns who pay for her services br br While this film can t even be released in Thailand due to it s controversial subject matter most American audiences will find this ho hum horror pic a cross between Showgirls and Interview with the Vampire as directed by Walt Disney br br If not for a few scenes with significant amounts of blood the MPAA could probably rate this for pre teens only There is literally broadcast TV adult fare although you d expect at least a sex scene considering the fact that the film is about a brothel and one of the actresses is a Thai porn star in real life br br As for the lesbian angle there s one brief smooch and a couple of I love you s to prove that the two main stars really are a couple on brother And the P bar has got to be the only exotic dance club on the planet where the girls keep their sarongs on and do carnival stunts there s a swordsman who cuts cucumbers out of a girl s mouth ooh phallic imagery br br NO nudity NO real monster unless you count a five foot high Thai spirit with yellow eyes and no way any ADULT should ever pay to see this kind of stupidity except on DVD You ve been warned
This was shown as part of the 59th Edinburgh International Festival though for reasons best left to the powers that be A lot seems to have been made of the fact that it s the first Thai language film made with Thai actors crew but directed by a westerner Needn t have bothered to be honest as this film is dull dull dull Why hint at something why shroud an idea in mystery why subtly invoke a feeling when you can hammer the point home with terrible voice overs obvious shots and over the top scenes Nothing is left to the imagination as time and time again director Spurrier clumsily churns out endless clichés No hinting no guessing it s all up on screen no need to use our imaginations Wonder when the scary bit is coming No you wont cause the soundtrack will get more and more intimidating rising to a crescendo of ominously Hell I m making up words to describe how bad this is Wonder whether the conjured demon is real or imaginary Why tax yourself it s really is a snake and yes it s really is biting his crotch and there s blood splattering everywhere it s a strange uneasy film for several reasons It s supposed to be a horror film but it s not scary the jolts are signposted obvious It might be a scathing attack on the seedier side of Thailand yet the director has a sleazy lubricious style when it comes to showing barely pubescent teens Maybe it was casting himself as the virginity taking westerner that planted the seeds of doubt in my head Or maybe the whole thing was just pants Uninspired insipid repetitive hackneyed all candidates for best description but dull seems most appropriate and honest It s all been seen before probably better often with more thought rarely with less imagination or flare Sorry Thumbs down on every count Truly dire
I will be short This film is an embarrassment to everyone except its cinematographer The very fact that it is a critique of the sex tourism industry seems valid until we are treated to a lingering dance scene The plot is ridiculous no one except the most ardent fan of BAD horror will get anything out of it And for the love of God please stop saying this film is a tale of innocence lost or even of female empowerment because it is quite clearly not childish fumbling lesbians what the hell this was by far the worst film at the Edinburgh festival that i saw anyway someone even collapsed halfway through the film probably because they couldn t take any more of it this may seem like an overly critical rant but i genuinely cannot find a redeeming feature of this film except for perhaps if you take it as pure comedy In short this film is best watched on a cocktail of class A drugs
I have come out of several years of lurking on these boards due to the sheer lack of intelligence that is communicated through the reviews that periodically appear on this film s IMDb space I saw this movie courtesy of subway cinema s new york Asian film festival which had an otherwise excellent selection of movies this year see vital snake of june CHA NO AJI Survive Style and have regretted every day that a scene from that movie disengorges itself from the back of my mind and becomes a vivid memory br br I m sure that you can read a laudatory summary of the film off of Subway Cinema which is probably why I made the mistake of dragging my friend to the film The description built up the kind of horror film that I had longed for for a while one that relies on sheer terror rather than cheap scares P was in fact different It relied on cheap laughs br br The incredibly annoying announcer described this movie as Lesbians team up to fight monsters Completely untrue There is a subplot built up in this film to make it seem like the relationship between the girl and Pookie is actually going somewhere More lies This film seems like a short made for Are you afraid of the dark The story is ridiculous and only succeeded in eliciting laughter and confusion from the audience after they finally rescinded their attempt to view this film with any semblance of seriousness and try to forget the 9 that they wasted at the door I almost wish paul spurrier was in the audience so that I could laugh at him and ask him why he wasted 5 years in thailand to make a bad softcore horror cum porn that belongs on the spice channel which only succeeded to get the actress excommunicated from her family and caused a minor stir at the belgium film festival The only stir that this caused was a gurgle in the lower intestine as it couldn t extract itself from the sh te that it is Anyway I hope I can dissaude anyone from making the grave mistake of seeing this film it was truly one of my top 3 worst movie experiences knocking out soulplane for the number 2
Made the unfortunate mistake of seeing this film in the Edinburgh film festival It was well shot from the outset but that s the last positive comment I have about the film The acting was awful I wonder if actual gogo girls were hired But it was the plot that was truly laughable in fact that it was laughable and not boring is the only reason I gave this 3 10 br br Spoilers below br br I just want to mention a few of the scenes that really got the audience laughing br br Shoving the girl in the field who would have thought that a kid shoving another kid could be acted so badly A real eye opener br br The getting on the bus scene the girl is getting on the bus But according to the music the world is ending br br The rolling under the clothes line Wow this one really demonstrates the plot writer s skills In the room followed by raw meat and skill selling Why not just get her to perform all three sins at once At least then the film might have been slightly shorter br br The running down the stairs of the mall watch as one of the girls takes to flight down the stairs pursued by a flesh eating Dau no wait she is just walking quickly trying not to break her nails br br The running covered in blood this is definitely my favourite scene and a fitting end to the movie A half marathon in red paint completed by vaulting up stairs and over the bridge only to be sent flying most unrealistically by a passing car Not only this but this suicide is undertaken by the most self obsessed girl in the film now that s sticking to character for you br br I d like to think that this film was created by a 16 year old and their mates Sadly having met the director at the presentation this is not the case br br But if you re in a sarcastic mood and fancy a laugh with a few mates then still don t even think about it
Watching Kroko I would have liked to leave the cinema very much for the first time in my life I would not recommend to watch this movie flat main characters absolutely no development e g Kroko the metaphoric German problem child remains a pure metaphor without any capability of positive involvement despite several plot wise chances to do so Uninspired actors non evolving plot I guess the movie attempted an environmental survey but did not succeed camera appeared shaky rather than motivated Pictures were low contrast gray and dark i am sure deliberately but the components did not add up to a convincing impression of the social milieu The story had certain potential though it could have made a good short story
Any person with fairly good knowledge of German cinema will surely tell that numerous films about a young girl having troubles with her mother as well as her boy friend have been made in the past If such a film is shown to people again it would surely click provided if it has something new fresh and captivating for today s challenging audiences This is also true for German film maker Sylke Enders as her film s principal protagonist Kroko has been mistreated by everybody around her including her mother and boyfriend She is bold enough to face any punishment as she has tried her hand at all kinds of criminal activities including shoplifting Kroko was originally shot on DV to be blown afterwards to 35 mm format Its technical virtuosity does not hamper our joys when we learn that Kroko would like to become a policeman as she feels that she is averse to the idea of becoming a run of the mill hairdresser If someone were to state a positive aspect of Sylke Enders film it may well be Kroko s involvement with handicapped people as a result of a punishment It is with Kroko that we learn that punks are human too with their unique joys and sorrows
Years ago I saw The Godfather and it made a lasting impression on me the atmosphere of the movie was first class the acting memorable and the storyline a classic Recently I bought the Trilogy and after watching Part 1 again I looked eagerly to viewing Part 2 I was so pleased to realize early on into Part 2 that here was a fitting follow on to the great Godfather movie again everything was just about perfect and I could not wait to see Godfather III WRONG I wish I d stopped at II The storyline was not good it seemed to me like a story made up just to have a story the characters were weak especially the daughter Pacino s protege was a weak character that would have been eaten alive in Godfather 1 or 2 Then scenes such as Corleone being invested with all the trappings of the Catholic Church with full choir the assassin on horseback riding away into the sunset the unseen helicopter machine gunning of the meeting where the goodies get away and everyone else is shot daughter and 1st cousin rolling bits of pasta across a board the pathetic shooting on the steps Corleone stuffing sweets down him with orange juice for diabetes a man of his intelligence and guile isn t ready for an emergency NO it was not good and with the best will in the world I wont be able to watch it again But I ll watch 1 2 many times down the years
And finally old old Michael Corleone falls over and goes THUMP Who REALLY did the writing for this last installment of the Godfather saga Probably the same staff who does As the World Turns This flick doesn t deserve the title Godfather at all Let s call this one The Cosas of Our Nostras or All My Capos As someone who s encountered a number of Mafia people in my business life I can say without exception that I ve never met any mobster as inwardly conflicted and contemplative as Michael Corleone Let s face it these guys are in the Mafia solely because they re greedy nothing more In this film Don Corleone spends lots of time pondering his past deeds and his bleak future perhaps even the Afterlife then recovers remarkably fast in order to pull off some fantastic business deal or order the death of this one or that one like the big time operator he is deep down Then there s his failed marriage After the break up scenes in G2 we may hope that Michael Kay will reunite as man and wife but here they seem to just become very good platonic friends who can laugh cry share intimate thoughts about their lives It s as if the screenwriters try to make Michael into a woman It s bizarre behavior for two people who shared the passion of the marriage bed for 9 years There s some miscasting here and there or perhaps they re sins of authorship Poor old country beautiful Sophia Coppola is saddled with a hopeless role with too many short lines in the film that don t fit what a young woman would say in casual conversations was given remarks rather than lines to emote Her passionate lovemaking scene with Andy Garcia looks like something from a bad teen sex comedy as they chew their open mouthed kisses and fondle each others backsides on the kitchen drainboard like marionettes scullery sex was brought off wonderfully by Glenn Close and Michael Douglas but it s just laughable here Then there s Andy s character Vinnie Mancini who s also given a difficult thankless role to play He s expected I guess to be the new new Don Corleone but he s almost handed the job on a silver platter and has to do little to strengthen his position unlike Michael s simultaneous hits on all 5 Families in G1 This hand me down process may be an authentic way of transferring power in a Mafia Family but why is so much made of this boring routine Certainly Don Vincent may earn the respect of his fellow gangsters someday but there s little character revelations in the script to give us a portrait of this young man sadly Puzo did such a fine job of quickly concisely developing Michael s character in G1 But G3 has no economy in it s story telling and we suffer through drawn out expositories until we just want to take a snooze Thirdly George Hamilton was also handed a thankless task in taking over as family lawyer after Robt Duvall reportedly turned down a 3rd installment as Tom Hagen George wisely underplayed his role so it came off without damage to the actor The development of Connie Corleone s character is interesting but it goes too far when she takes murderous matters into her own hands she could well end up sleeping with the Fredos if this were the real world But it s not all bad The assassination scene in the hotel penthouse is nifty Also they keep pulling me back in or words to that effect is a great line And we recover some old country feel as we get to go back to Sicily even if it s all done in 1989 and they ve got modern cars haircuts The plot lines involving the corrupt hierarchy of the Catholic Church are pretty interesting since it s based on some actual financial shenanigans at Banco Vaticani in the 1980 s but it s brought too far again with the too spectacular death scenes etc The Grand Opera scenes are very dramatic and well photographed But the death scene of Mary toward the end is an unbalanced attempt of emotional manipulation at best All screenwriters need to learn that we don t always need more and more death in order to bring a mafia movie to a successful conclusion You feel sorry for Kay that her daughter is dead she plays her grief so well but Michael s reaction is hammy hammy hammy Then Michael dies sometime in the 21st Century in Sicily alone on a grand estate of heart failure no grandson to play with before his demise no wife to grieve for him What SHOULD have happened in the last 1 2 of this movie is Michael being tracked down by someone like Rudy Guilliani put on trial all his dirty family s sleazy little enterprises and bloodthirsty indulgences brought into the light of day Michael then convicted under RICO statutes and sent to Federal Prison for life then he can keel over dead from heart failure while mopping a floor IN LEAVENWORTH That s how mafia dons were ending their careers in the late 80 s and early 90 s and they got much better treatment than what they deserved
I dislike this movie a lot If you ve read the Puzo s books or at least have watched very closely the two first movies specially the first one you re going to agree with me br br Compared with the Corleone s saga presented by Puzo s novel the script of this film is sometimes even ridiculous The characters and the relationships among them are distorted The story ends up reaching nowhere although it appears to go to some direction during the movie br br It is understandable that different times should be expected for the Corleone s saga in the 90 s and that we would not gonna find things the way they were before But in the other hand I don t know why they had to copy some dialogues from the other movies in contexts when they didn t fit Why this It sounds like those poorly made sequels that just try to copy the original film s qualities br br What will never be understandable is the fact that Mario Puzo Coppola and Al Pacino joined together to make this A man who directed pieces like Apocalypse Now and Godfather has to be forgiven for almost anything he does in cinema until he dies So does Al Pacino for being the actor he is But Mario Puzo shouldn t have written this How come He damaged all his previous work What a shame my friend The Puzo s novel The Last Don is a 90 s story about the mob and it is great We can never tell the same about the plot for the Godfather III
Near the beginning of The Godfather Part III Michael Corleone s son wants to drop out of law school and become a musician Michael Corleone does not want this But his estranged ex wife Kay manages to convince him to let Anthony Corleone pursue music as he wishes So he does br br That seems like an odd way to start a review as it is a minor plot point and has nothing really to do with the major action Just bear with me here you ll see where I m going with this eventually Now let me tell you about the major plot It is about Michael Corleone wanting to quit crime for good he has largely abandoned all criminal elements in his family business But then along comes Vincent Mancini an illegitimate nephew who is involved in a feud So of course Michael must endure yet another brush with criminality and gun violence and all that good gangster stuff Meanwhile Vincent has a semi incestuous affair with Michael s daughter Mary Oh and Michael and Kay are trying to patch up all the horrid things that happened at the end of Part II br br It is like a soap opera One horrid awful 169 minute soap opera Gone is any sort of the sophistication romance and emotional relevance that made the first two movies hit home so hard After a 16 year break in the franchise Francis Ford Coppola delivered a mess of sop and pretentiousness entirely incongruous with the first two films once again proving his last great work was Apocalypse Now back in the 1970 s br br What s worse The Godfather Part III isn t even a logical follow up of The Godfather Part II Michael is a completely different person He hasn t just gone to seed which might be legitimate even if it d be no fun to watch He s become a goody goody that s trying to fix all the tragedy that made Part II such a devastating masterpiece His confession to the priest was bad enough but that little diabetes attack in the middle pushed it over to nauseating He also gets back together with Kay For heaven s sakes there is absolutely no way that should happen as the 2nd movie made abundantly clear She aborted his baby and his Sicilian upbringing made him despise her for it Didn t Francis Ford Coppola even think of these things br br And don t even get me started on Mary and Vincent s affair For a romance so forbidden it was shockingly unengaging Sofia Coppola s acting did nothing to help She made the smartest move of her life when she switched from in front of the camera to behind it because she was possibly THE worst actress I have ever seen in a Best Picture nominee Every line she delivered was painfully memorized and every time the drama rested on her acting abilities all she elicited was inappropriate giggles In the climactic scene I won t go into detail but you ll know which scene I m talking about when if you watch it she looks at Michael and says Daddy I think I was meant to cry but the line was delivered so poorly I burst out into long loud laughter br br Now we get to the climax and now you will also realize why I took time to start the review with a description of Anthony Corleone s musical ambitions After 140 minutes of petty drama and irrelevant happenstances Anthony Corleone returns with an opera So Michael Kay Mary and Vincent go to see it and for about 10 15 minutes a couple killers walk around trying to assassinate Michael About this climactic sequence I must say one thing It was really good But not because of the killers they were pretty boring I just really liked the opera It had some great music and real great set pieces And from what little it showed us it seemed that the story had echoes of the Corleone family s origin I ll bet it was one swell opera and I ll bet Michael Corleone was glad he let his son switch from law school to music br br My biggest wish is this that Francis Ford Coppola had merely filmed Anthony Corleone s opera for 169 minutes and ditched the rest of the soggy melodrama Better yet I wish he hadn t made The Godfather Part III at all Part II gave us the perfect ending This spin off was self indulgent and unnecessary br br P S This is not a gut reaction to the film I watched all 3 Godfather films over a month ago though I was rewatching the first one Not only does this mean that my expectations for Part III weren t screwed in fact I had set the bar rather low for it after what I heard but it also means I ve had a good time to think about all three films While I was a bit disappointed with Part II at first the more I thought about it the better it seemed But with Part III it was bad to begin with then got worse the more I thought about it The sad thing is that many people will stop with Part I but if they watch Part II as well they will most likely go on to Part III If you have the will watch Parts I II and pretend like Part III never existed
The Godfather Part I was a stunning look inside the fictional Corleone family and how an innocent young man was all but forced into circumstances he never wanted to have a part of The Godfather Part II shows that young man s acceptance of his new role his desensitization of character as well as his complete loss of all innocence as he dives deeper and deeper into a life of crime The first two parts of this saga of this transformation of Michael Corleone make for one of the greatest tragedies in cinematic history br br Then along came The Godfather Part III Michael Corleone is now the aging Don of the Corleone family He shows remorse for his previous actions not through subtle behaviors but by trying to use his powers for good and admitting all his wrongdoings and regrets to others Very cliche and uncharacteristic of the complex character that is Michael Corleone Michael s plans to use his powers for good are derailed by an ambitious young disciple and his enemies Michael s daughter is eventually a casualty of the ongoing mob wars and her death predictably leads to Michael realizing that his entire life as Don has been worthless for he has failed in the one thing that was the reason for putting himself into the position he was in protecting his family br br The Godfather Part II ends with Michael Corleone reaching the lowest of the lows having his own brother killed Before Part III was made the Godfather saga was an emotionally riveting tale of an innocent young man s journey into darkness with the unbelievably tragic end of Michael forgetting his roots and abandoning the one thing that has always mattered most to him and those around him family loyalty Part III paints the picture of Michael as a man who is and always has been just a victim of circumstance This greatly corrupts the meaning of the first two films br br The Godfather Part III is a horrible mess of a film that never should have been made The only solution to the problem that is this final installment of The Godfather movies is to pretend that it does not exist and that the saga actually ends with Michael s shockingly horrible act of having a member of his own family killed
The danish movie Slim Slam Slum surprised me to be the worst movie i have seen to this date I didn t think that it was possible to top my list of bad bad b movies but this one deserves the gold It s not funny It s bad acting It s bad filmed and the storyline is bad The only positive thing i can say about this movie is it has three girls in it I truly believe this flick has the potential to knock of the other danish movie Stjerner uden hjerner as the badest danish film ever made And that s truly something Congratulations in advance
What a crappy movie The worst of the worst This movie is as entertaining as a dead slug No talent what so ever actors stupid plot Who wrote this script Was there ever a script for this goofy movie or did the director just accidentally press the record button on his camera and then decided to make the film up as they went along Is this meant to be a kids movie or a comedy or what My friends younger brother is in the 6 th grade and him and his classmates just did an amateur movie for their school project which outdid this geeky movie This is by far the worst film I have seen in my life There is just no excuse for this flick
I have never seen a movie as bad as this It is meant to be a fun movie but the only joke is at the start and it is NOT funny If you like this sort of movie then you may just be able to give it a vote of 2 If it had the necessary votes it would truly belong on the bottom 100 br br
Slim Slam Slum is a sad and disappointing picture There is absolutely no reason to this sorry excuse for a picture Don t go there what ever you do don t Watch TV Shop for 10 hours straight instead That way you will be slightly amused
The show had great episodes this is not one of them It s not a terrible episode it s just hard to follow up The man that was death All through the house and Dig that cat he s real gone br br This episode is about a couple that has just been married Peggy Ammanda Plummer and Charles Stephen Shellen In the first five minutes you find out that Charles only married Peggy for her money The two go on their honeymoon and their car breaks down on a dirt road and they have to seek refuge in an old abandon mansion Charles soon finds out a secret of Peggy s family br br In my opinion you should watch this episode but just don t expect the same feeling as the rest of the episodes in the first season
HORRID br br The special effects make the TV version of Tremors look real br br No one in the cast can act br br Kind of like the 62 Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea meets the cartoon ocean going electric eel cartoons
This was one of the worst movies EVER It was so bad I was laughing through the WHOLE movie The plot was SO cheesy especially the end This movie turns from an end of the world disaster to save the eels I mean c mon And I swear I think they use SOCK PUPPETS for the eels And there was this horrible kiss scene in the middle with the two main characters who happened to be divorced How predictable It was SO terrible that my mom my sister and I couldn t finish it and when we DID finish it it was about a year later The second time we watched it and we finished it this time we did MST3K like comments throughout the movie br br Summary Only watch this if you re a movie basher Make hilarious comments watch this at a sleepover for laughs and I mean HUGE laughs Also watch for mockery The metaphor that explains this movie This movie is a very shallow field full of cheese and sock puppets
Actually had to stop it Don t get me wrong love bad monster movies But this one was way too boring regardless of the suspenseful music that never leads you anywhere The actress had too many teeth and that moment when she makes contact with one of the beasts was way too obvious a cliché This film totally betrays the cover on the DVD which looks pretty interesting From the cover one expects a giant monster but you get these cute not as gigantic as expected electric eels Moved on to watch another film called The Killer Rats but that s another review Deep Shock was really crap a big shame considering the fact that it looks pretty high budget
Deep SH is more like it The eels are just cartooned in over the film Think The Incredible Mr Limpet meets Leviathan Very tacky br br No character or relationship development So called romantic scenes very corny and predictable An interesting idea but a poorly written script and LOUSY special effects make this a definite must miss
I don t get this The movie obviously has a pretty good budget It has very good cinematography It has nice pacing good editing and pretty good directing too Then WHY OH WHY didn t they hire someone to do a final rewrite of the script so it would not be so damn cheesy and WHY OH WHY did they hire such lousy actors that can t act their way out of a paper bag This movie could have been good At most times it LOOKS good and FEELS good but in the end you realize that the movie was no good at all br br So I would say it s a good production but a bad movie Too bad actually br br And eels Come one really
This has to be the cheapest film made in 21st century It is all the way low quality but at the end it falls below everything All the cheap tricks like flashing and darkness are used to hide those crappy computer effects br br All the actors are below average especially the main character Anne Fletcher Simmone Mackinnon There is a scene where Anne is asked Why you seem so careless The correct answer is because she can t act No matter what happens the world is about to be destroyed her friend is dying she is fired she has the same stupid grin in her face br br It is not only the movie which is B quality It is also the back cover description at least in Finland The text mentions things like Lorica Gray vessel Capital vessel and main character Garrison Harper and Anna not Anne Fletcher The description sounds like a different movie both featuring character called Fletcher and sea monsters
Deep Shock plays out like a TV movie a whole cast of commercial quality actors a poorly designed creature to be the bad guy and a script that is more full of technical political jargon and importances than it knows what to do with br br I checked out the movie because of the creature I love to see what filmmakers have in mind for their designs in these cheaply made videos and right off the bat I got disappointed because the creature on the box was not the one in the movie The actors I expected because of the type of film it is really quite generic and not thought out past a certain point The music was typical not thought out action symphonic music br br I liked the design of the computers and technical equipment along with the mini sub design The movie even flowed really well with guiding screens letting you know which set you re watching the story unfold in But there isn t much of a story here anyways br br This movie gets a 3 10 stars IMO The boring search and destroy mission to blow up the North Pole and these creatures protecting it kinda lame Even lamer is the tagged on love relationship between two of the characters that you don t see coming Chalk this one up to being a movie which tries to get actors careers off the bench and into a video Don t bother
A mediocre Sci Fi Channel original picture A little squirmish but not much The nuclear powered submarine U S S Jimmy Carter is on a mission deep below thick frigid ice near the North Pole when it is attacked by giant super charged electric eels A member of the crew Simmone Jade Mackinnon thinks she has devised a way to communicate with the monsters but is not given much chance for vague reasons Also among the crew are David Keith Mark Sheppard and Sean Whalen This movie could have been somewhat better if the eels monsters were not so cartoonish
This is the worst movie ever made The acting the script the location everything I would have given it a little chance if there were attractive women in the movie but even they were bad You would think that a movie with the word beach in it s title would have good looking women in it Wouldn t you
Is nothing else on TV Are you really bored Well then watch Phat Beach However don t rent it and definitely DO NOT buy it That would be a big mistake br br I watched this on TV and found myself laughing at certain points I did not laugh long and I did not laugh hard However there were subtle jokes and comments I laughed at If you are looking for an extremely funny hood movie then watch Friday If you are looking for a powerful emotional movie something that this movie tries at kind of watch something like hoop dreams or Jason s Lyric If you are lookin for some good black booty go watch a Dominique Simone porn flick because the nudity in this movie is nearly non existent However if you have nothing better to do and this is on cable go ahead and watch it You will be slightly amused br br 3 out of 10
Watching this movie was the biggest waste of time and 2 bucks for rental in my life If nothing catastrophic happens before I die this will be the biggest regret of my life Who ever even thought about this movie or financed deserves a kick between the legs because that s where they were thinking when they made this movie It s about an overweight guy who is a hopeless romantic and writes pretentious drivel that tries to pass off as poetry He joins his amorous friend in a trip to the coast Where they meet girls and such Only the fat guy doesn t get a girl Skin flicks don t annoy me I take em for face value But this movie tries to be more than a skin flick It s about Fat guy looking for love in some girl but then meets another bikini silicone girl that enjoys his poetry He finds his talent for volleyball which gets money for his family and impresses the ladies only he has his lady anyways The dialogue is super horrible for even a C movie It supports a ton of black stereotypes no character development it s a glorified porno movie without any porn in it Never ever watch this movie
I watched Phat Beach on cable for a while and I sort of enjoyed it The fat guy is the best character as he seems to be a nice guy The rest of the characters are just various stereotypes of young men and young black men I like to watch these low budget movies that capture a period of time because they are almost like a documentary of the year s attitudes and fads Phat Beach is also funny because the low budget babes in this movie are strictly home girls Most low budget movies have that local babe quality and you can tell the babes in this movie were the local strippers and underwear models for JC Penneys Some of them had so much cellulite hanging from their bikinis that it was funny to watch how the youngsters went wild over what was essentially some really over used high mileage skank There were some cuties too That is the charm of these low budget crappy movies You will see a lot of doggies and some real cuties I checked up on some of them at IMDb and seven years later Phat Beach is their only credit Too bad It would be interesting if someone ever managed to do a Where are they now book on all of the cuties that have appeared in the history of movies and then were never again to return What happened There are probably one or two young people in almost every movie who seem to have a lot going for them and yet years later when you see the movie again on TV you wonder what ever happened to X Anyhow this movie mostly blows but it has some funny moments
This could have been a good episode but I simply had to turn it off The British representation was horrible to watch Have the makers ever set foot in Britain prior to filming At least set foot in England I don t think any British person have had such an accent apart from a comedy skit of The Royal Family Also with the 2 English boys well I don t think any English boy has acted spoke or dressed like any English kid in the history of the British nation since Prince William and Harry s preteen public appearances To American film makers There is more than 1 country in the UK England Wales Scotland and Northern Ireland meaning more than 1 culture I can handle some stereotyping but this was so bad I could not watch it Fire looked cool though
Murder and insurance fraud take an adulterous couple to the end of the line br br TV was visually vulgar back in the early 1970s and this truncated made for TV knock off hurt my eyes It can t possibly compare to the 1944 Billy Wilder Film Noir classic as anyone in their right mind ought to know sight unseen but that doesn t mean this update should be seen as a separate entity either Although based on the original Paramount screenplay there s over half an hour cut out and the director s bland indifference makes what s left imminently forgettable With rare exception the younger generation wasn t interested in watching old black and white movies on TV back in 1973 still true today alas so this lurid compelling tale was new to the overwhelming majority of viewers then as now ratings rule and cashing in was its only reel raison d etre Gus Van Zandt remade Alfred Hitchcock s PSYCHO for similar reasons and if these redux led to the seeking out of the original films or novels so much the better I loved the James M Cain source novel enough to tune in back then and I enjoyed this time capsule curio the second time around for the longish hair halter tops turbans ugly decor and lush auburn locks of guest star Samantha Eggar who didn t try too hard In addition to recognizing a few of the incidental cast from a childhood spent in front of the boob tube Lee J Cobb was able to hold my interest as a world weary tired looking Keyes but Richard Crenna s affable and inoffensive Walter Neff only reminded me of Bill Bixby on a bad day Improvement upon the original was of course never intended in a rush to make a buck but instead of a mindless retread a new adaptation of the novel would have been a novel idea Cain s book differs somewhat from its celluloid incarnations and the horrific shark fins in the moonlight ending is killer The completist in me is thankful this speeded up Me Decade update was included as part of the DOUBLE INDEMNITY DVD extras but the experience not only made me long to see the original it had me nostalgic for any episode of the better made COLUMBO TV series I also flashed back to a very good 1973 ABC TV Movie Of The Week that I haven t seen since its initial airing John D Macdonald s LINDA starring the beautiful Stella Stevens as a ruthless femme fatale who murders her lover s sexy John Saxon wife and then frames her mild mannered husband for the crime and if I remember correctly there s also an open ended ending Like DOUBLE INDEMNITY it was needlessly remade with TV movie queen Virginia Madsen as the titular vixen and Richard Thomas as the milquetoast husband
As a big fan of the original film it s hard to watch this show The garish set decor and harshly lighted sets rob any style from this remake The mood is never there Instead it has the look and feel of so many television movies of the Seventies Crenna is not a bad choice as Walter Neff but his snappy wardrobe and swank apartment don t fit the mood of the original or make him an interesting character He does his best to make it work but Samantha Egger is a really bad choice The English accent and California looks can t hold a candle to Barbara Stanwick s velvet voice and sex appeal Lee J Cobb tries mightily to fashion Barton Keyes but even his performance is just gruff without style br br It feels like the TV movie it was and again reminds me of what a remarkable film the original still is
Utter dreck I got to the 16 minute 27 second point and gave up I d have given it a negative number review if that were possible although pissible is a more fitting word Unlike the sizzle you could see and practically feel between MacMurray and Stanwyck in the original the chemistry between dumb ol Dicky Crenna and whats her face here is just non existent The anklet becomes an unattractive chunky bracelet There s no ciggy lighting by fingertip And I thought I d be SICK when they have a mortified looking and rightly so believe you me Lee J Cobb as Keyes practically burping upchucking his way through the explanation of his Little Man to Mr Garloupis No offence to the non sighted but it looks as though a posse of blind men ran amuck with the set design of both the Dietrichson and Neff houses The same goes for those horrid plaid pants that Phyllis wears And crikey how much does Neff make that he lives overlooking a huge marina This folks again all takes place in the first 16 and a half minutes If you can get through more of it you have a much stronger constitution than me or you are a masochist But please take some Alka Seltzer first or you WILL develop a little man of your own that may never go away Proceed with caution obviously
When someone remakes a classic movie the remake is always unfavorably compared to the original Also there s a chance that the remake is so radically different that it is just too unfamiliar to audiences br br Well the 1973 TV version of Double Indemnity has almost identical scenes and dialogue as the 1944 original The main difference is that the remake just seems to have no energy at all Fred MacMurray was great as the lecherous leering insurance agent Walter Neff in the original Richard Crenna just seems world weary and tired Edward G Robinson brought great manic energy to his role as MacMurray s boss Barton Keys Lee J Cobb a fine actor appears almost bored with the proceedings Samantha Eggar is all wrong as the conniving back stabbing Phyllis Dietrichson while Barbara Stanwyck was just superb in this wicked role Eggar is overly polite and mannered and just seems way out of place br br Robert Webber in the old Richard Gaines role as Robinson s boss Norton and John Fiedler taking the Porter Hall role as the crucial witness bring some life to the movie In particular Webber recreates the Norton role well in a 1970s context br br However after the movie starts the whole thing just sort of lies there without any life or electricity This is one film that never should have been remade
This 1973 TV remake of the Billy Wilder classic is inferior to the original Surprise br br First the good things Lee J Cobb makes a terrific Barton Keyes He s not as good as Edward G Robinson of course but he s the only reason to watch this This remake s only improvement over the original is that it cuts down the role of Lola Dietrichson the step daughter of the femme fatale Phyllis Dietrichson br br And that s it for the good things br br The bad things are many The director records everything in an indifferent manner if you watched the film with the sound muted you d hardly get the impression that anything especially interesting was happening Because of modern bad taste the film must be in color instead of black and white Because of 1970s bad taste all the sets are distractingly ugly Walter Neff s expensive apartment in particular is hideous br br The modern setting hurts in a lot of small ways Train trips were a bit more unusual in the 70s than in the 40s so Mr Dietrichson s decision to take a train seems more of a contrivance Men stopped wearing hats which prevents Walter from covering up his brown hair while posing as the white haired Mr Dietrichson Women in mourning stopped wearing veils which robs Samantha Eggar of a prop Barbara Stanwyck made splendid use of in a key scene Oddly Lola still has the line where she reveals that her stepmother was trying on a black hat and veil before she had need of them br br Stephen Bochco keeps much of the Billy Wilder Raymond Chandler script the same But he makes a lot of tiny inexplicable changes to the dialogue which leave the script slightly flabby where once it was lean and muscular Outrageously the famous motorcycle cop banter is gone but look closely and you ll see what looks like a post production cut where those lines should have been Bochco may not be to blame br br Richard Crenna is passable as Walter Neff What might have made this version tolerable is a really splendid Phyllis Dietrichson Instead we get Samantha Eggar who comes off like a standard issue villainess from Barnaby Jones But who can blame Eggar With a director who barely seems interested in what s happening in front of the camera how could Barbara Stanwyck herself have come off well
Watch the Original with the same title from 1944 This made for TV movie is just god awful Although it does use as far as I can tell almost the same dialog it just doesn t work Is it the acting the poor directing OK so it s made for TV but why watch a bad copy when you can get your hands on the superb original Especially as you ll be spoiled to the plot and won t enjoy the original as much as if you ve watched it first br br There are a few things that are different from the original it s shorter for once but all are for the worse The actors playing the parts here just don t fit the bill You just don t believe them and who could top Edward G Robinsons performance from the original If you want only watch it after you ve seen the original and even then you ll be very brave if you watch it through It s almost sacrilege
It was hard to watch this film and be totally fair and objective since I am a big fan the original 1944 movie That to me and many others is one of the greatest film noirs ever made Realizing this is simply a shortened made for TV film and that most people had trashed it I didn t expect much but you can t help but compare this with the 44 film Scene after scene I found myself comparing what I was looking at it and remembering how it played out with Fred MacMurray Barbara Stanwyck Edward G Robinson and others Now I was seeing these famous actors playing their famous roles replaced by Richard Crenna Samantha Eggar and Lee J Cobb br br When it was all over I found it wasn t as bad as I had expected but it s no match for the 1944 original The two main areas in which this made for TV film wasn t as good were 1 the electricity between the two leads was missing and 2 being only 90 minutes they rushed the story with hardly time to develop the plot characters and chemistry between those leads Crenna and Eggar were flat and simply no match for MacMurray and Stanwyck as Walter Neff and Phyllis Dietrichson respectively br br Where this re make held its own was in the other characters such as Barton Keyes and Edward Norton Cobb was terrific as Keyes and Robert Webber as Norton head of the insurance company It also was somewhat interesting to see the time frame changed so the houses cars telephones dictating machines etc were all early 70s instead of mid 40s Otherwise the storyline was very similar just rushed br br However one viewing was enough and I will happily go back to the original version for the rest of my viewings of this classic story and film
When Samantha Eggar as Phyllis Dietrickson answers the door of her house swathed in a towel you realize that as competent an actress as Eggar may be she doesn t have the hypnotic allure of Barbara Stanwyck And it is not entirely Eggar s fault In the original film Wilder had Stanwyck not only appear in a towel but she enters the scene on the second floor balcony of the house And she doesn t come out she appears almost as if by magic Walter Neff is staring up at her from below on the first floor There is a reason for this Stanwyck is much higher than Neff Fred MacMurray when they are first introduced It is not just the towel The towel adds to the seductive allure Her pose is like a Greek Goddess overlooking her domain and in a strange way you feel as if from the start she is actually controlling the entire situation She has sexual even magic power This person is no ordinary housewife This person is a mystery with secrets hidden within br br Back to 1973 The remake has Crenna knock on the front door Stanwyck s stand in Eggar answers the door with a towel around her There is no appearance She simply opens the door The alluring superiority that grabs the audience at the first appearance of Stanwyck in 1944 is entirely absent in 1973 She opens the door with a towel around her It may be sexy in a Charlie s Angels sort of way but it s not nearly as mysterious The filmmakers of the remake seem to misunderstand Wilder s point The script may have said Phyllis appears in towel so the filmmakers of the remake simply follow the instructions and include the required towel The point is not the towel The point is the enigmatic quality of Phyllis and the potential power she wields Wilder gave her a towel to add to her mystique The filmmakers of the remake gave her a towel because that s what Wilder did And in the choice of shot lost all of Phyllis mystique br br Richard Crenna also seems miscast He seems like he s acting and not really in the midst of the dilemma Part of the problem is Crenna appears so much like a 70 s actor He can t get into the 1940 s When MacMurray first speaks into the microphone sweat begins to drip from his face No sweat on Crenna And they also changed one of the crucial lines at the beginning In the original Neff says I didn t get the money and I didn t get the woman In the 1973 version Crenna says I didn t get the money and I didn t want the woman Did the filmmakers completely misunderstand the entire point of the story Or were they dumbing it down for a television audience br br This made for TV movie is a by the numbers rendition All the sharp edge of the original is lost The only stand out maybe is Lee J Cobb in the role made famous by Edward G Robinson But he cannot save the loss of intensity of the original This 1973 boring remake is a forgettable TV movie made probably by the same people who did Gilligan s Island They might as well have tried to remake Citizen Kane or Gone with the Wind If mediocrity is the best one can hope for what s the point The 1944 classic is a Film with a capital F This made for TV remake deserves an F grade or maybe a D for dumb
This 1973 remake of the classic 1944 Billy Wilder film Double Indemnity is a textbook example of how to destroy a great script This grade B TV fodder also illustrates the folly of remakes in general While Hollywood has gone after greedy executives that colorize black and white films and sought disclaimers on wide screen movies that are shown in pan and scan versions the industry has ignored the hacks that insist on taking a classic film and diminishing it with a shoddy remake br br The first step in producing a bowdlerized version of a classic is to edit the script The Billy Wilder Raymond Chandler work was cut by a half hour to fit the finished film into a specified time slot with room for commercials Then update the production with bland color photography smart upscale sets and TV familiar actors Thus the brand new Double Indemnity eliminates the atmospheric black and white film noir cinematography that enhanced the mood and characterizations of the original Gone are the dusty shadowy claustrophobic sets that explained the protagonists desires to escape their situations at whatever cost Gone are the close bond between Keyes and Neff and the erotic attraction between Neff and Phyllis br br The look of Jack Smight s take on Double Indemnity is more Dynasty than film noir Phyllis Dietrickson has a designer home to die for and Neff s comfy pad would be hard to afford on an insurance salesman s salary not to mention the sporty Mercedes convertible that he drives Neither character has any apparent motive to murder for a paltry 200 000 If not money then perhaps murder for love or lust Not in this version Richard Crenna shows little interest in Samantha Eggar and their kisses are about as lusty as those between a brother and a sister Crenna fails to capture the cynicism of Neff and his attempts at double entendre and sexual suggestiveness fall horribly flat Eggar is little better and lacks sensuality and the depth to suggest the inner workings of a supposedly devious and manipulative mind Only Lee J Cobb manages a creditable performance as Keyes Director Jack Smight and his three principals have all done much better work br br There was no conceivable reason to produce this wretched remake except to fill time in a broadcast schedule There was no conceivable reason to resurrect this dud on DVD and package it with the original film except to fill out a double disc package The only lesson that can be learned from this misfire is that even a great script and great dialog can be ruined with poor casting lackluster direction and TV grade production values The 1973 Double Indemnity should be titled 10 Indemnity because viewing it only underscores the 100 perfection of the original movie
Bought this movie in the bargain bin at Rogers Video store for 2 I enjoy a good B movie now and then and figured this looked like a good one br br The movie is quite cliche 1970 s and is quite groovy for that Unfortunately the story line is hard to follow and not a lot happens in the movie In fact I turned it off after watching it for 45 minutes and figured a week later that I should watch the whole thing no matter how slow it was br br The movie has good spots in it but you have to wait and wait and wait for them br br If you are into B movies this might just be for you just be warned that the movie is slow and not much really happens and did I mention not much story line either br br
I noticed with some amusement that in the end credits the Detroit PD is thanked for their participation The Chief of Police even has one speaking line playing himself and boy can you tell he can t act The reason for the amusement is that in this movie the police shoot first and ask questions later Not the kind of PR I would think a police force would want Other than that this is your standard cops and robbers film dressed up for the 70 s with a racial angle Alex Rocco is given a thankless role of a lifer cop that can t get ahead and is saddled with a mentally ill wife He makes up for this by hanging out at the local whorehouse Hari Rhodes is his dashing partner that has a groovy wardrobe and likes to chase after suspects while wearing a trenchcoat The movie moves along until the penultimate shootout that makes absolutely no sense why do people that are only guilty of a robbery take on a whole police force Not only do we see one shootout but since there are four bad guys we get to see four Then there is a twist ending that is supposed to leave one guessing what really would have happened but only left me thinking how stupid it was Seeing that director Arthur Marks was also behind the braindead Friday Foster and Bucktown I shouldn t have wondered
You know when you re on the bus and someone decides to tell you their life story and you sit there with a pathetic smile on your face when all you really want to do is slap the fool and walk off Well I had a similar sensation while watching this film Okay I did actually choose to go and see Aprile and I knew about Nanni Moretti s taste for making himself the one and only star from Caro Diario but after about half an hour of this latest installment from his memoirs I wanted to give Moretti the madre of all slaps Caro Diario was funny unusual and at least a couple of other characters managed to get a word in edgeways In Aprile however Moretti has exclusive rights to the dialogue so that all you hear for an hour and a half is a high pitched whine going on about how his politics are best or what quirky piece of popular culture is tickling his fancy at the moment He also finds time to slag off films that he doesn t like something I thought was reserved for losers like me Surely being in a position like his you d think he d try and make a point about cinema a little more intelligently than this By making a proper film perhaps one with some ideas and a decent structure or maybe one that isn t completely dominated by his annoying voice And when he started fawning over his newborn baby I just wanted to go and be in the company of someone normal preferably not a self obsessed film director with a strange penchant for tacky music The next time someone you don t know tries to tell you their life story give them a slap from me Every blow will be a small victory in the fight against Morettiism
however I am not one of them Caro Diario at least was watchable for two thirds of the time but the boring and self centred third section of that movie gave us a taste of what was to come in this extraordinarily self indulgent mess Moretti says he feels a need to make this movie but doesn t want to whereas the viewer feels that he should stick with it but really doesn t want to either A film about Italian politics and elections could be fascinating but this is not that film At one point Moretti and his friends are standing outside the Communist Party headquarters discussing the interviews they are preparing to conduct with Party leaders inside but it s characteristic of this film that we never get to see anything of them Interposed with Moretti s political ravings are the events leading up to the birth of his son and subsequent home movie shots of him with the baby and later the infant Pietro the film drags us through several years and more than one election period We keep expecting to see some definitive sequence or cogent argument but they never come I for one doubt that I could have the patience to ever sit through a Nanni Moretti movie again He succeeds in making an hour and twenty minutes seem like an eternity
Before Stan Laurel became the smaller half of the all time greatest comedy team he laboured under contract to Broncho Billy Anderson in a series of cheapies many of which were parodies of major Hollywood features Following a dispute with Anderson Laurel continued the informal series of parodies at Joe Rock s smaller and more indigent production company br br Most of Laurel s parody films were only mildly funny at the time and even less funny for modern audiences who haven t seen the original movie which Laurel is parodying West of Hot Dog is a fairly generic parody of cowboy shoot em ups It s marginally a specific parody of West of the Pecos an oater released two years earlier with no major actors Since West of the Pecos was never a huge success it s difficult to see why Stan s film unit chose this particular movie as a target for their lampoonery much less why they waited so long after its release to parody it And where did they get that title West of Hot Dog Possibly it s down to the fact that Hot dog was a sexual interjection favoured by American lechers in the 1920s As in the opening scene of the stage play Machinal br br West of Hot Dog was produced and co directed by Joe Rock Among his many other achievements Rock introduced Laurel to Lois Neilson and he was subsequently best man at their wedding Full disclosure In the last years of his life I had the great privilege of befriending Joe Rock and interviewing him Nearly ninety years old at the time Rock s memory was impressively clear but he remembered nothing at all about West of Hot Dog and I can t blame him This movie is eminently forgettable br br The leading lady s character is named Little Mustard If that s meant to be a parody of something in West of the Pecos I don t get it There are a couple of impossible gags here including Laurel s method for mounting a horse For just one moment in this movie Stan Laurel reminded me of the great Buster Keaton when he suddenly broke into a run West of Hot Dog is vaguely similar in subject matter and tone to Keaton s short comedy The Frozen North but Keaton s version is much funnier The plot of this film somewhat anticipates a situation in Keaton s feature Our Hospitality but again suffers by comparison here two tough varmint brothers expect to inherit the Last Chance Saloon but the previous owner has bequeathed it to weakling tenderfoot Stan However the brothers will become the legal heirs if Stan dies Hmmm br br Seriously though is such a bequest legal As soon as Stan takes possession of the property surely any further questions of ownership or inheritance become his decision not the previous owner s decision I had plenty of time to consider such points of law while watching this dull comedy br br At one point a gag involves some crude animation drawn directly onto the film stock It looks cheap and isn t funny br br This Hot Dog is no weiner and no winner it s just a whiner My rating one point out of 10 Hang on Stan in a few more years you ll be one half of a comedy legend

This insipid mini operetta featuring a Eddy McDonald prototype in a Valentino scenario is so bad it becomes an endurance exercise after five minutes It s silly from the get go as this brevity opens two military men discussing the lack of manliness in the son of one of the officers In under a minute he is packed off to Morrocco where he lives a double life as the Red Shadow the leader of an Arab tribe that would rather sing than fight br br Alexander Gray and Bernice Clare possess fine light opera voices with little acting ability and there s a decent bass in there as well but the acting is so haphazard scenes so ill prepared you get the feeling they are making things up as they go along br br This two reeler was part of a larger stage production that lists six writers With more room to spoof and warble the show may have had some entertainment values but this rushed quickie is little more than an insult to an audience waiting for the feature presentation
Getting lost in space frozen for 15 years that s unlikely Falling into a star improbable Falling into it the day it goes supernova and explodes ludicrous Getting rescued by a ship just then priceless br br No it s not Zaphod Beeblebrox s Heart of Gold to the rescue It s also not the Parent of the Year awardees After sentencing her daughter to two years solitary confinement on an abandoned spaceship the mother encourages her to get drunk and wander off alone with the strange man they ve picked up This foreshadows their prowess in hand to hand combat which makes up most of the film s action Combat highlights include for example the psycho talking close up face to face with one woman while blindly pointing the gun behind him at the other about six inches away who obligingly simpers in the line of fire br br In the end the family of three abandons the metropolis sized ship they were planning to use to observe the supernova until the last instant because it is too slow to escape the blast wave instead using the psycho s fighter ship which they ve refueled in one minute with 1600 pounds of gas propellant from a 0 7 kiloton missile You have to love those hard sci fi statistics br br As long as Hollywood treats writing as an irrelevant frill they ll continue making movies not fit to run at 3 am on the Sci fi channel
A pretty average scifi film The plot was more or less obvious from the start Although the acting was reasonably good the writing seemed very cliched using ideas taken from numerous films br br The basic plot Scientists working on a deep space research platform rescue a fighter from crashing into the red dwarf that they have been orbitting Onboard they find a stasis pod which coincidently malfunctions at that very moment After 2 or 3 minutes of the man in the pod waking up you realise that he is a complete lunatic Something which totally escapes the 3 person crew of the research ship br br After that it becomes a rip off every other film involving a psychotic madman terrorising innocent victims overall I think Speed 2 was a better exploration of the subject matter which I didn t consider to be a good film either br br Not a good film get Aliens out and watch that again br br
On a distant planet a psychopath is saved from execution by a space monk He releases a few fellow inmates and breaks out of the prison in a spaceship They dock onto a ludicrously enormous spacecraft that is orbiting a supernova star This massive craft is populated by only three people presumably because the budget of the film did not extend to hiring many actors Anyway to cut a long story short the three goodies end up in a game of cat and mouse with the baddies br br The psychopath in this movie is curious in that he is annoying Annoying is generally not a term one would use to describe a lunatic unhinged frightening dangerous maybe but not annoying but he is The three people manning the giant ship are seriously unconvincing as warranting such important roles this ship is practically the size of a city Considering that the film is set approximately 50 years in the future it is somewhat optimistic that such a huge man made craft could exist never mind the fact that it is used for such a relatively mundane task Despite the vast size of the spaceship the crew all have appallingly kitted out tiny rooms and the dining room consists of what appears to be a plastic table and chairs But there are a lot of corridors br br The film is fairly well acted and it works as an averagey sci fi thriller But nothing great
Despite unfortunately thinking itself to be a intelligent b important and c interesting fortunately this movie is over mercifully quickly The script makes little sense the whole idea of the sado masochistic relationship between the two main characters is strangely trite and John Lydon shows us all in the space of one movie why he should never have let himself out of music His performance is one note and irritating br br The only positive thing to be said is that Harvey Keitel manages to deliver a good turn His later Bad Lieutenant would show just how badly good actors can act but mercifully his performance here is restrained
I saw this on DVD It s known as CORRUPT in this format and the blurb on the casing really hyped up how Harvey Keitel s character Frank is so much like the one he played BAD LIEUTENANT in This gritty and powerful police thriller What the casing didn t mention was that this is an old Italian movie How old is it Theo Well when a character plays music he doesn t put on the CD player he pulls out a big plastic pancake thing puts it on a sort of revolving hob where a sort of mechanical arm touches the pancake thingy causing music to be heard You see my point about this being an old film The DVD case gave no clue this was a movie made 20 years ago It s also a film with poor production values like so many other Italian films masquerading as American ones With the exception of Keitel the cast are awful though Johnny Rotten s performance is bizarre rather than terrible the cinematography is static with the picture and sound quality giving the impression that I was watching a fourth generation pirate copy I don t know if it s down to a dodgy DVD or if it s a very bad film print and worst of all is Ennio Morricone s score It s impossible to belive the man who did the irritating intrusive incidental music for CORRUPT is the same one who did the music for those Clint Eastwood westerns br br All of this is a pity because CORRUPT does have its moments It s by no means the greatest psycho thriller ever devised but it did hold my interest and as always Keitel puts in a good performance as a violent nutcase cop Just a pity the rest of the movie didn t match up to his high standards
Encouraged by the positive comments about this film on here I was looking forward to watching this film Bad mistake I ve seen 950 films and this is truly one of the worst of them it s awful in almost every way editing pacing storyline acting soundtrack the film s only song a lame country tune is played no less than four times The film looks cheap and nasty and is boring in the extreme Rarely have I been so happy to see the end credits of a film br br The only thing that prevents me giving this a 1 score is Harvey Keitel while this is far from his best performance he at least seems to be making a bit of an effort One for Keitel obsessives only
I thought Harvey Keitel a young fresh from the Sex Pistols John Lydon then as a bonus the music by Ennio Morricone I expected an old school edgy Italian cop thriller that was made in America Istead I got a mishmash story that never made sense and a movie that left me saying WTF Too many unanswered questions and not enough action The result a potential cult classic got flushed down the toilet Keitel and Lydon work well together so maybe Quentin Tarantino can reunite these guys with better script Oh and the Morricone score OK but not memorable br br Overall not a waste of time but not a must see unless you are a hardcore Keitel fan
TOM BROWN S SCHOOLDAYS br br Aspect ratio 1 78 1 br br Sound format Stereo br br In late 19th century England young Tom Brown Alex Pettyfer is sent to the public school at Rugby where he experiences the reforms of a radical new headmaster Stephen Fry and stands up to the school s resident bully Flashman Joseph Beattie br br Already the subject of numerous screen adaptations most notably Gordon Parry s superior 1951 version Thomas Hughes evergreen novel gets the early 21st century treatment courtesy of screenwriter Ashley Pharoah TV s Where the Heart Is and director David Moore THE FORSYTE SAGA It s pleasant enough and watchable but it s also rather staid and dull distinguished only by Fry s sincere performance as the new principal determined to sweep away some of the school s most dubious traditions and by the introduction of a possible new star in 14 year old Pettyfer a talented kid with the kind of effortless charm and vivid good looks that should take him all the way to Hollywood and beyond Otherwise this is typical UK TV fodder the kind of stuff favored by executives eager to fill the schedules with prestige product even one as thoroughly unremarkable as this The UK publication Radio Times described it as daintily odd and raised a querulous eyebrow over all of that fagging and brutality and a handsome rakish villain torturing the life out of sweet young boys Quite
This tear teaser written by Steve Martin himself is so unbelievably bad it makes you sick to your stomach br br The plot is pathetic the acting awful and the dialogue is even more predictable than the ending br br Avoid at all costs
This film is a flagrant rip off of one of the best novels of all time Silas Marner by George Eliot br br The details of the film shown on IMDb do give acknowledgement to the original authoress but I did not see this at the beginning of the film only a credit at the end of it saying suggested by the book Silas Marner Suggested It was nothing but a complete rip off of all the essential elements of the story br br A wronged and sad old man an artisan poor and lonely has all his money stolen One night a child wanders up to his door as her mother lies dying in the snow outside The man takes her in and brings her up until one day the local squire or rich politician here demands to adopt the child It is he who has fathered the child during an illicit affair years before The battle then ensues as to who should have legal custody of the child br br In this and every other aspect of the film the story is exactly the same In only one can I find a difference Silas Marner had epilepsy but perhaps that would have strained the acting abilities of Mr Martin too far On top of that he has his hair dyed in some carrot juice concoction presumably to make him look younger but actually making him look more the clown that he is There is also the addition of meaningless jokes that this offbeat comedian cannot resist bringing into the story which have no part in it and only detract from the profoundness of the story Like when the child cries in the courthouse declaring she can only be happy with the man who has fathered her all these years This is conveyed in the film by the girl applying nasal decongestant to the bridge of her nose to make her tearful br br I am surprised that legalities and integrity within the film industry permit such a film to be made If I was a trustee of George Eliot s I would insist on reparation If I was Steve Martin I would send the profits to that estate or to the poor At the very least it should be entitled Silas Marner adapted by S Martin Or better still removed from the archives br br If you are interested in this story and I hope you are dismiss this completely and watch Silas Marner Or read the book The BBC made an excellent adaptation of it in the 1980 s
There is something kind of sad about seeing someone who is so good at doing something try to do something very different and end up being mediocre I was thinking about Jordan playing baseball but the same applies to Steve Martin br br This movie is reasonably well acted and directed but the script is a stinker Martin did a great job adapting a classic story into a comedy in Roxanne but this effort to bring a Victorian drama to the contemporary scene smacks straight into a wall of implausibility If you want to see an old story updated with some style best to rent Great Expectations
Just got back from a free screening and I m very glad I didn t pay to see this very sub par film The theater was full and the crowd was a mix of kids and adults It seemed like it was just the kids who were laughing at all the slap stick and fart jokes though good god they loved to hit these poor mice in the crotch a lot The movie is pretty juvenile unintelligent predictable and mostly annoying The characters just seem to be thrown together to fill in empty space and the relationships between them all seemed very forced with no charm at all br br Visually the film is about average with nothing that really stands out They did a decent job of mimicking the clay look from Wallace and Gromit but other than that it s very forgettable imagery br br Although I was really bored throughout the whole film I chuckled a couple times It s not an absolute failure but I most definitely would not want to watch it again If you re a parent with kids and you don t care that your kids see mindless cheap jokes then feel free to take them to see it but everyone else shouldn t waste their money
A few months ago I was involved in a debate with another IMDb poster Hey Kmadden about this film The poster insisted that if I gave Flushed Away a chance I would like it Based partially on that argument I agreed to watch the film br br Flushed Away has good intentions At least on Aardman s part but lacks the strength to pull it all together Its best asset is sewer rat boat captain Rita Played by Kate Winselt who IMO should have been the movie s main character instead of Roddy Hugh Jackman Rita s cool tough and interesting while Roddy spends much of his screen time sniveling br br One of the things that bothered me most about FA is the repetition of jokes that aren t funny to begin with When Roddy gets hit in the crouch the film makes sure he gets hit five more times immediately My name s Shocky says one of Rita s brothers who then electrocutes Roddy at least three times My tolerance for cheap gags that involve pain is at an all time low br br I won t waste time griping about Katzenberg s kleptomaniac tendencies toward Pixar One similar film s a coincidence five s a rip off but I will say I m disappointed in Aardman They can do and have done so much better Try harder next time guys
I wandered into this movie after watching the 82 minute Borat tonight and left quite disappointed I was a huge fan of Wallace and Gromit and routinely go to see animated films That being said I found myself nodding off and at one point nearly walked out but stayed waiting for this film to get better Never happened br br The visuals are stunning and the voice work is top notch especially in my opinion that of Kate Winslet and Ian McKellen I had to remind myself a few times the bulbous headed lizard villain was Gandalf and Magneto The problem with this movie for me is it s one of those animated features for the ADD set It registers after the fact as one zany slapstick routine after another weighed down by a treacle filled plot that pulls out every stop in an attempt to convey an Important Message It looks a lot like busted Oscar bait for the animated category and considering the way it s scoring with critics I wouldn t be surprised if the Academy gets it wrong and offers up its hardware But if you re looking for an enjoyable animated feature about rats take my advice and wait for Ratatouille
OK maybe a 13 year old like me was a little to old for this movie Its about this pampered rat who lives in a palace Then a sewer rat flushes him down a toilet He ends up in this rat city and meets this girl rat who has a gem a greedy frog wants He will do anything for this gem he sends a whole army after these two rats He plans to take the gem and to flood rat city THe cool part about this movie is the slugs They do all the sound effects They sing make noises its awesome its also pretty funny OK bottom line it is aimed at 7 year olds Other wise a great movie to take a younger family member to see I didn t think the animation was real dreamworks art though more like WAllace and Gromit i thinkthey slacked a little on that The movie was just decent not worth spending 9 50 for though sorry
Don t understand how these animated movies keep coming out and no matter how good or bad it is people love it br br I saw this movie with my two kids 5 7 They like pretty much anything animated like most people who rated this film The theater was almost full and I looked forward to seeing the movie with its superb cast To tell the truth I was bored silly It was unbelievably predictable and just plain unfunny There were a couple chuckles throughout the film and that was it Of course they tried time and time again to get the cheap laugh but just didn t work My son almost always says to me that he wants the DVD after we see an animated movie but not on this one My daughter fell asleep half way through Also the kids thought the character animation looked weird I haven t heard that from them since seeing The Polar Express which gave my daughter nightmares br br Trust me I m not the type who looks for the negative in everything But quality is quality and like so many animated movies they throw out there it has very little
From the creators of Shrek OK that grabbed my attention br br Well the creators of Shrek also made Madagascar Madagascar was half as good as Shrek br br And now Flushed Away is half as good as Madagascar br br That means Flushed Away isn t good The animation and all that special effects were extremely good but the movie wasn t br br The story of this movie was only meant for kids It s seriously not possible for adults to actually love this flick br br But there were many jokes meant for adults I bet kids dint understand the jokes br br Despite that I dint like this flick br br I am completely disappointed 4 10
So don t even think about renting this from the shops because this is one hell of a bad movie You d think that JJ Abrahams had written this movie Basically a rat is flushed down the toilet and somehow has to get back out Fans of the completely terrible Shrek might enjoy but Wallace Gromit fans will probably turn away in disgust Also why didn t they do it in plasticine or clay I mean CGI animation For an AARDMAN movie Obviously Aardman lazed around while they let Dreamworks do the whole thing Wrong wrong WRONG Nearly every single character is awful apart from that freaky frog guy who is just right for a movie villain But everything else about the movie is DULL DULL DULL I almost fell asleep with boredom watching this movie No wait actually I DID fall asleep with boredom watching this movie It s just terrible But thankfully it s not as bad as Shrek
Let s just say it in simple words so that even the makers of this film might have a chance to understand This is a very dumb film with an even dumber script lame animation and a story that s about as original as thumbtacks Don t bother unless you need to find some way to entertain a group of mentally retarded adults or extremely slow children They might laugh especially if they re off their meds There s a special kind of insult in a film this ridiculous not only do the filmmakers apparently think that children are brainless idiots who can be entertained with claptrap that cost approximately zero effort but they don t even bother to break a sweat inserting a gag here and there that an adult might find amusing This film frankly ticked me off royally Shame on you for stooping so low
Oh if only I could give this rubbish less than one star There were two mildly amusing parts in the whole film and that is it one was where a line or two from the song Don t Worry Be Happy was sung by the slugs and the other was where Roddy fell of the toilet roll and landed with his feet and legs apart so that everything else he landed on on the way down hit him in the groin That is it there was nothing more amusing than that at least not for me anyway Doctornappy2 is not right in saying Fans of the completely terrible Shrek might enjoy but Wallace Gromit fans will probably turn away in disgust As I loved Shrek 1 2 and 3 and I also love Wallace and Gromit You see what it boils down to is that if an animation is done extremely well then it is definitely worth watching this however was about as far from done well as you can possibly get The continuity mistakes were too big in number Some were pointed out by the makers of this site others were not I won t point out all of the others but here are a few more to see When the young daughter leaves at the start of the film the catch to the cage door comes down and the hook part of it that is on the right clearly goes back around behind the round knob thus effectively making sure Roddy would not be able to get out and yet he does just by simply kicking at it At one point the ruby falls down Roddy s back and gets pushed straight up into the the air by Rita all the while the ship is moving forwards In the next scene Roddy has caught it again This is impossible Seeing as how the ship is moving forwards the only place when the ruby was ejected out from under the back of Roddy s shirt the only place it could have landed was in the water not in Roddy s hand There was a third one I wanted to point out but for now I have forgotten it br br Too many for want of a better word jokes were repeated in one way or another there was not enough time to establish any sort of connection with any of the characters the characters were hollow shallow and empty and the whole film left you wanting wanting to watch 85 minutes of anything else Paint drying or grass growing are two superb options
Ultimately too silly and pointless Yes there is the gilded cage metaphor but probably most kids would miss that Forgettable Instantly br br Animation is as we have come to expect super real The plot line could best be described as thin but tenacious Although the ending seemed arbitrary to me br br The sewer underworld is a suitably disgusting reflection of the world above and somehow wealth and money seem to count for a lot there too Oh yes and there s a romantic interest with the female being the smarter more savvy and go getting of the pair this in itself is rapidly becoming a tiresome anti stereotype Probably your kids will love it though
Can anybody do good CGI films besides Pixar I mean really animation looked antiquated by 2006 standards and even by 1995 Toy Story standards Or maybe they spent all their budget on Hugh Jackman Whatever their reasoning the story truly did suck br br Somehow Hugh Jackman is a rat a rat that is flushed down a toilet Yeah I know seems stereotypical But then the sewer mimicked the ways of London to an extent Throw in a promise of jewels and an evil frog and you get a pathetic attempt at entertainment br br I would like to say something entertained me Maybe the hookup in the movie Or maybe the happily ever after rat relationship But nothing did It had the talent but it blew up D
If your idea of entertainment is watching graphic footage of people being run over by cars you get to see a woman passing under the front wheel being twisted as the car passes over her before she goes under the back wheel and they show it twice in case you missed it the first time then this is the documentary for you Admitedly I didn t watch any more of this very disturbing piece of voyeurism but that was enough for me Maybe the rest is even better br br I wonder how long it s going to take for television networks to start showing slush movies Perhaps game shows based on self mutilation might be nice br br I already know that there are disturbed people in the world and that horrible things happen I don t need to see the proof on the TV masquerading as entertainment
The Cat s Meow contains a few scenes that boast intelligent dialogue and some fine performances a few of which surprised me Eddie Izzard is more effective than I expected as Chaplin partly thanks to an excellent hair and makeup job by some talented designer Joanna Lumley is compelling as novelist Elinor Glyn and Kirsten Dunst is winning as Marion Davies though why movies never use her real life stutter is difficult to explain But these elements don t add up to a successful whole The screenwriter seems to have worked very hard on certain scenes the meetings between Davies and Chaplin are particularly well crafted but not so hard on the big picture Several minor characters don t need to be there and don t behave consistently The basic plot is full of illogic e g why does Thomas Ince think it s a good idea to tell Hearst something he really doesn t want to hear and the party scenes are repetitive and tiresome I d like to think a trip on Hearst s yacht was more fun than the movie indicates Davies is characterized as a standard bubbly Flapper type which isn t really accurate and the screenwriter s ideas about Chaplin and love are implausible br br Strangely Bogdanovich who seemed so connected to the Thirties in Paper Moon lacks a similar affinity for the Twenties He insisted the excellent costume designer use only black and cream which gives the party guests a very artificial look and plays only the most stereotypical songs of the period e g Yes We Have No Bananas When Hearst insists everybody Charleston Charleston it looks as if the actors had a ten minute dance lesson just before the scene was shot br br The lives of silent film stars can make fascinating movies I m sure but not this time
Anything that might have been potentially interesting in this material is sunk in the first few seconds with a disclaimer that the events we re about to see can t ever be known and This is the whisper rumor most often told about one of Hollywood s most sensational mysteries br br Okay So we re not getting anything new and E s Mysteries Scandals gives you a better foothold on the particular incident and that s not much of an endorsement What do we get br br We learn that Hollywood is a nest of viper s and decadents No big news there More interesting we learn what a washed up director is willing to do to regain his position of power in the entertainment industry and or political establishment It raises the question of whether Peter Bogdanovich is speaking from his own experience through these characters But what s told is so cynical and ugly and muddled we re left feeling guilty for witnessing a bunch of hooey that passes itself off as history br br The tone of the film has a curious madcap quality that I found more irritating than fun We re not empathetic with anyone And the great Citizen Kane polishes off the relationship between Davies and Hearts in a much more convincing way In The Cat s Meow we re not ever sure of Davies motives for being with Hearst As soon as we re told one thing she s off doing the other br br And are we to believe that Davies was the love of Chaplain s life Or is he just trying to cockold one of America s most powerful and apparently moronic citizens The film never makes it clear br br What is convincing are the production values There s a glorious recreation of the yacht and period costumes I got more out of looking at the construction of some of the lapels on the men s jackets than following a story that libels many of the the most well known personalities in Hollywood history No one will remember that the screenplay is pure fiction The disclaimers that frame the film only make it all the more tentative and unsatisfying br br The performers can t be faulted although Meg Tilly goes way past parody here Kirsten Dunst never disappoints She gives the most sincere performance in a sea of scenery chewing Only Joanna Lumley rises above the material but so much so that she seems to be distancing herself from the whole enterprise rather than narrating it One of her first lines is I m not here And I m sure she wishes she wasn t br br This isn t on par with Bogdanovich s trashy so bad it s good At Long Last Love It s perched on attempting something serious but hesitates and stumbles chiefly because it s so full of bitterness towards the beast named Hollywood This is National Enquirer filmmaking And it not only soils the names of those who the film places on board the Oneida that weekend but the audience gets pretty dirty as well
What happened to Peter Bogdanovich Once a brilliant director a trail blazer is now scraping the very bottom Is this the same man who directed The Last Picture Show Here he takes a somewhat interesting albeit farfetched premise and turns it into bubble gum that loses flavor the moment you take the first bite Dunst is not bad but Izzard is miscast as Chaplin and all the other actors seem to have been cast for their looks and not because they were right for the part Too bad I ll go rent Paper Moon again
Kirsten Dunst is terribly overrated as an actress You can tell always she s just acting I like Izzard though Plot is awfully boring The viewer has no real connections to the characters never knowing who to really sympathize with or even care about Slow dull movie with some laughs but few and not very funny anyway Plot is not engaging or suspenseful in the least You can see each plot turn coming a mile away What is this movie supposed to be Comedy Drama Who cares You won t by the end of this film
Just because an event really happened doesn t mean that it will make a good screenplay movie The Cat s Meow by Peter Bogdanovich claims to be based on actual events which happened on a cruise hosted by William Randolph Hurst The writer paid more attention to creating a bizarre cast of characters than taking time to create a story for the bizarre characters to inhabit The key moments of the story seem implausible for example when Hurst accidentally shoots the producer believing him to be Chaplin Basing a key element of a story on someone wearing the wrong hat is trite and contrived The story attempts to be a dark comedy but The Cat s Meow misses an important piece of this equation comedy There is also a lack of empathy for any of the characters It hardly matters who is shot who is killed who is guilty and who is innocent There is not a strong character to cheer for As a result the conflicts are difficult to care about and the eventual outcome is incidental
Anyone who is a sucker for 1920s jazz 1920s dress the Charleston and ultra swanky yachts e g me on all counts will want to like this movie But the sad fact is that that s all there is The plot is banal and obvious the acting mostly either awful or playing to the farcical side of the goings on and when the whole thing s over there is not much left but the impression of mirrors and smoke This is a beautifully made bad movie
is the only way to describe this movie about subjects that should be surefire scandal sex celebrity power Kirsten Dunst grins her way through her role as silent movie star Marion Davies like she thinks she s in Legally Blonde The guy who plays William Randolph Hearst overacts to the point where you want to reach into the screen and slap him Eddie Izzard is pretty good except that he s playing Charlie Chaplin and is about oh 125 lbs too heavy for the part Hard to believe this hamfisted uneven wreck was directed by Peter Bogdanovich but then again he hasn t made a watchable movie in what 30 years Sometimes there s just no coming back
After seeing this film I complained to my local cinema about the quality of the sound track or whether the cinema sound system may be faulty For at least the first half of the film it is extremely difficult to understand what anyone is saying because of the background 20 s music and the scratchiness of the sound track I was ready to blame the cinema equipment but not so it was the Director br br I was told the subject of my complaint was an essential part of the making of the film The music and the sound was supposed to be distorted to create a very disturbing effect within the film These days directors will go to many lengths to make their film unique Unfortunately no matter where or how you see that film the sound score will be the same br br So apart from the historical inaccuracies of this film which you can find out for yourself elsewhere the sound track distortions are in themselves a good reason to give this film a miss You will only hear the distorted scratchiness of the sound track and certainly not a cat s meow
I am appalled at how bad this film is As a pastiche of early 20th century Hollywood artistes it sets a new low even past The Moderns or gasp Cradle Will Rock I never thought I d see a film worse than those 2 Granted they were about a slightly different milieu period Nevertheless the intents results were distressingly similar br br First off there s the horrible casting Eddie Izzard as CHAPLIN Excuse me Peter did you owe this guy something Jennifer Tilly as Loulla Parsons Kirsten Dunst as Marion Davies Holy smoke these people don t even begin to try to capture the look or sound of the period they are purportedly depicting br br Well Last Picture Show was a decent film but this thing is a disaster the rest of Bogdonovitch s pics haven t been much better Guess rubbing up against Welles Hitch Ford wore off a long time ago Still good for hosting TCM though
What is supposed to be a simple generic mystery plot involving a dead philanthropist is in fact a head ache inducing tale about a bunch of characters the only big actor being Ginger Rogers in a very early role all trying to find the murderer among a small cast of residents in a posh apartment building These characters range from utterly stupid to downright mean As a cheap low budget production most of the action revolves around Rogers and her lead man some guy I don t care who he is cause he really sucked talking about their various possibilities of solving the crime while being constantly cut off by an absurd detective with his head in his butt Honestly I ve never had a worse time watching an old b rate movie of this type and I ve seen some real head slappers br br Oh and the butler didn t do it because there wasn t a butler But pay attention to the guy who s closest to a butler There ya go br br PolarisDiB
A very young Ginger Rogers trades quick quips and one liners with rival newspaper reporter Lyle Talbot in this 1933 murder mystery from Poverty Row film maker Allied Productions The movie opens with a wealthy businessman taking a header from the roof garden of a high rise apartment house or was it from a lover s apartment Rogers actually has two identities at the film s outset that of Miss Terry the dead victim s secretary along with her newspaper byline of Pat Morgan Mistakenly phoning her story directly to Ted Rand Talbot instead of her paper s rewrite desk she gets fired for her efforts when her boss learns he s been out scooped br br Here s a puzzle it s revealed during Police Inspector Russell s Purnell Pratt investigation of Harker s death that Terry Morgan had been employed as his secretary for three weeks Why exactly was that After the fact it would make sense that she was there for a newspaper story but before Clues are dropped regarding Harker s association with a known mobster conveniently living in the same apartment building but again that association isn t relevant until it s all linked up to janitor Peterson Harvey Clark And who s making up all the calling cards with the serpent effecting a HSSS with the words You will hear it cut and pasted beneath Apparently the hissing sound of a snake was the sound made by the apartment house s radiator system which Peterson used to transmit a poisonous gas into the rooms of potential victims such as Mrs Coby in the apartment below Harker But in answer to a question posed to Inspector Russell about Mrs Coby s death he replied apparently to the cause of strangulation br br It s these rather conflicting plot points that made the movie somewhat unsatisfying for me The revelation of janitor Peterson as the bad guy of this piece comes under somewhat gruesome circumstances as we see him stuff the unconscious body of Miss Morgan in the building s incinerator furnace However and score another point against continuity we see Miss Morgan in a huge basement room as Peterson ignites the furnace she made her getaway but how And still pretty as a picture And who gets to make the collar off screen if none other than milquetoast police assistant Wilfred Arthur Hoyt who in an opening scene fell over his own feet entering a room br br Sorry but for all those reviewers who found A Shriek in the Night to be a satisfying whodunit I feel that any Charlie Chan film of the same era is a veritable The Usual Suspects by comparison If you need a reason to see the film it would be Ginger Rogers but be advised she doesn t dance
Rival reporters Pat Morgan Ginger Rogers and Ted Rand Lyle Talbot are always trying to out scoop each other on stories The latest involves the mysterious death of a philanthropist who fell to his death after a shriek was heard from his penthouse apartment The two reporters start out as rivals but combine efforts to solve the crime and write the story when more residents of the apartment building turn up dead according to the DVD sleeve s synopsis br br This said to be follow up to The Thirteenth Guest has little to do with the earlier movie it is not a sequel as has been inferred Ms Rogers continues to develop her skills Mr Talbot adds a little humor to his characterization They are a pleasant team the plot is interesting and mysterious but the resulting film is very dull The opening and closing are startling A long winded wrap up of plot development points follows the climax br br A Shriek in the Night 1933 Albert Ray Ginger Rogers Lyle Talbot Harvey Clark
This was a disappointment none of the nuance of the original The Brits just seem to be able to make a truly unsettling film with none of the over the top histrionics of the American version The original series combined both creepy stories and subtlety of performance with great attention to lighting and settings I have watched the series many times and am still enthralled br br Just another poor adaptation along the lines of the dreadful adaptation of Cracker Get hooked up with BBC America or BBC Canada and watch for such delights as Waking the Dead Spooks Silent Witness and Judge John Deed Watch the original Touching Evil then look for Wire in the Blood for more of the truly understated elegant performance of Robson Green Hollywood needs to have a look at this actor
This movie was supposed to have depicted a ladie s man bachelor who was ready and willing to settle down once and for all However I did not care for his mission to settle down because I didn t care for his character I don t understand what all of these beautiful women saw in him He had absolutely no class or charisma He should ve at least had a way about himself that made ladies weak in the knees other than his saxophone playing but to no avail Just because he is a musician does not make him sexy Not to mention the things he did to get the attention of a married woman he fell in love in a span of five minutes of knowing her were absolutely outrageous and ridiculous Does this man have any shame what so ever Had he tidied up and stopped doing and saying stupid things he would have been more attractive as a character but alas his character was bland and boring br br Gina Gershon s character was unnecessarily British She could ve just as easily been an uptight out of towner with her regular speaking voice than do a poor British accent that sometimes would fade through out the movie br br The only two characters I cared for were the fish and frog Now those two had chemistry Academy nominations for both STAT Plot holes lack of character development horrible acting unnecessary drama cliché moments What a mess of a movie
Let s face it romantic comedies are considered lightweight when compared with dramatic movies just look at the Academy Award nominations each year But still the good ones are truly an art form Look at When Harry Met Sally Sleepless In Seattle and classics like Roman Holiday and It Happened One Night I like the good feeling of seeing two people destined to find happiness br br This movie attempts to construct something that resembles a romantic comedy But no one believes the romance between the main characters and there is nothing funny to make up for that major shortcoming Modine is way past being a leading man especially a romantic lead I m sure as Executive Producer he had the means but not the good sense to cast himself And Gershon I see possibilities of some comedic talent but she had no script and a poorly developed character And whose idea was the English accent Pointless br br Others have stated it but I want to repeat this story is poorly conceived poorly executed the actors are terribly miscast and the characters well we just don t give a hoot about them br br An art form this ain t Go rent Moonstruck again
For the life of me I can t understand the good reviews on this piece of crap It was pointless Matthew Modine was horribly miscast as a leading ladies man Gina Gershon well others have said it but I ll reiterate why the stupid accent Totally unnecessary And her acting was just bad I don t know if she was thrown by the accent or what There was no chemistry between these two br br And the girl Modine was in love with suddenly she s shoving half a head of lettuce in her mouth and acting in a goofy way Where did that come from I think we were supposed to feel sorry for her as we saw her marriage to a workaholic begin to crumble but frankly I couldn t care less about any of these people
This is one of those movies that appears on cable at like two in the afternoon to entertain bored housewives while they iron The acting is second rate Poor Mathew Modine seems to sleepwalk through the whole film And god help Gina Gershon Her accent is too over the top It sounds nothing like an true English woman It sounds forced and phony much like her acting She should stick to what she does best lesbian showgirl con artist who plays in a rock roll band and has a drug problem The other characters are no better They are two dimensional empty vapid and silly How are we to supposed to care about these people At one point Christy Scott Cashman get s lost in Central Park Really It s not that hard to navigate Central Park Just follow any path out Not only did I not care about ANY of the characters I downright hated them The only reason I even stayed with this train wreck of a film was Fisher Stevens Even his brilliant humor couldn t save this dying Fish Each scene is typical romantic comedy fare and nothing is left to surprise us The script was awful as was the acting If you catch this Fish throw it back
I just saw this film last night in the 2006 Tribeca Film Festival and it seriously makes me wonder if the folks at the festival actually screen the films before selecting them The film was simply awful I say that without hyperbole or ulterior motives it was awful Matthew Modine s days as a leading man are way over Gina Gershon sported an inexplicable and unnecessary English accent she should be ashamed of her participation in this film Gloria Reuben had a weird little cameo in it she should also be ashamed The script was terrible and the we were given absolutely no reason to care about the characters I highly doubt this will be picked up but then again people in Hollywood are known to make mistakes sometimes I really think Kettle of Fish is a serious contender for the worst movie I ve ever seen
Worst movie ever made Please see the Real movie reviews from the pros on this movie Check Rotten Tomatoes on the web for some good independent reviews on this film The comments made on this site are apparently from folks with some financial interest in this film I find the positive comments very misleading I find it amazing how the negative comments are so bad against this movie and the positive comments sound like an Academy Awards Speech Don t waste your hard earned money This Film is retarded I can t believe a film like this would ever be made Why would Hollywood waste their time on such junk This film is an attempt at nothing I ask myself what looser would actually sink their money producing such trash I went to blockbuster and the attendant even told us not to waste our time or money I didn t listen and I did waste my time and cash Please don t make the same mistake It really is the Worst movie ever made
I m a fan of Matthew Modine but this film which I stumbled upon on cable is absolutely witless I see that the screenwriter and director were one and the same so there was no one around to check her worst instincts There are no surprises no original lines and no original characters The goldfish was basically the most sympathetic character What a waste of all this acting talent Given how expensive it is to film in New York these days I have to wonder how this got made in the first place And if you re wondering why I watched it at all it came on after a film that I like on cable and I left it on while I worked at the computer It s not a very demanding picture
Well you d better if you plan on sitting through this amateurish bland and pokey flick about a middle aged widowed mom who has a little more in common with her young adult or old teen daughter than she would like Set in Tunis mom piddles around the flat gets antsy and decides albeit reluctantly she just can t help herself to don the costume and dance in a local cabaret Meanwhile her daughter is taking dancing lessons The common denominator is a Tunisian band drummer This film is so full of filler I watched the DVD at x2 and read the subtitles fast forwarding through much of the very ordinary dancing and loooong shots of walking they walk everywhere and more walking and just plain dawdling at x4 just to get though this boring uneventful low budget flick which some how garnered some pretty good critical plaudits Go figure C
If you haven t figured out what is going to happen in this film in the first five minutes then give it a couple more minutes Lilia is a widow She has been left on the shelf for too long and she wants to burst out She has a teenage daughter which only highlights that she is not getting any younger While checking up on her daughter she discovers a world she never dared the cabaret where she can belly dance in skimpy sequined outfits while men throw money at her The film is very misogamist It s portrayal of men is dismal Which is rather odd as Lilia stoops to jiggle around for them not for money but just for the hell of it When she succeeds in arousing them it makes her feel like a woman again She does not wish to connect with them but she is addicted to the attention The other dancers all are mostly aging women who look like men in drag and realize their time in the spotlight is short lived Not short enough I say She does find romance however brief with you guessed it No surprises here we didn t see coming Though the ending is good you realize that it could have ended no other way Maybe this film just isn t targeting my demographic 30 Male
Just saw a pre screening tonight What can I say It lived up to it s mediocre trailer run though that s saying nothing at all It did absolutely nothing that any movie before it hasn t done and it played out in such a cliché fashion that eventually I got to the point where I stopped laughing only because I was laughing with the audience and instead let the humorless movie play out br br So let s see we have the less than spectacular main character that is trying to get back with his ex girlfriend but he s not good enough for her check We have the three buddies that all have their own personality with one being the best friend who tries to get with the main girl character s best friend but is constantly rejected another friend being the super awkward one that can t live down seeing the positive in everything 24 7 and is thrown in for the one liners which in this case is just a bunch of movie references specifically from Disney and the third guy whose name you won t ever remember but is there to complete the square and throw in consoling messages to whomever will care to listen check We have the girl s ex boyfriend and her parents block the relationship at any possible means when things are looking up not to mention the awkward family members from the main character s side check We have the downer period an hour into the movie where everyone is depressed check We have the movie s funny moments come from incessant swearing people falling down or being hit scenes from the trailer and homosexual innuendos check And dare I call it a spoiler but we have an ending that unfolds exactly as one thought that it would unfold before even seeing the movie check br br Honestly this could have no wait should have been a PG 13 movie All that needed to be dropped were any F bombs Honestly it would have gotten much more publicity from the crowd that enjoys this kind of humor would have gotten less media exposure and thusly would have not been disliked as much from people like myself who should try and hold it up higher to the recent R rated comedies like Superbad and Knocked Up The humor in this movie is just so awkward that it doesn t fit in with what general people look for I bet even the actors were often times unsettled with some of the dialogue and action they had to deliver on camera Let s put it this way in the theater it will help you laugh because it s on the big screen and others are laughing When this movie hits Showtime and you re checking it out at 2 00 PM on an off day you may be inclined to change the channel The only thing that will keep you watching is Alice Eve s hotness who is not quite a 10 but still very good looking br br Aside from the main resolution this film kicked a lot of subplots to the side of the curb and seemed to forget to write more story that they tried to develop in the beginning of the movie where everything else pretty much flies out the window So there is a main resolution but what comes of it It s never really clear cut nor does it allow the ending to be feel good with the abruptness br br There was only one thing worth nothing in this movie and that was the good soundtrack Aside from the nice choice of 90 s alternative rock songs there was a nice upbeat score that would play in some parts of the movie more so the beginning of it that reminds me of something David Holmes would mix up compose I ll give them props for a great choice of sound br br One last thing this movie was probably filmed sometime late last summer because the inadvertent yet proud Pepsi sponsorship showed the yellow bottle caps that they had during that Rock Band promotion I just figured a lot of Rock Band gamers would catch onto that one if you saw it But I say hold onto your money If this was PG 13 and you were 15 years old on a Friday night with a group of friends I d say knock yourselves out Otherwise definitely pass It doesn t try and compete with the R rated movies of the past few years and ideally it definitely isn t as good
This movie probably had some potential for something my bewilderment is how these utterly prosaic unfunny themes keep making it to theaters it s as if ideas are being recycled just because generations are Truly the decerebrate oafs behind most films are like dogs they return to ingest their own vomit Well they re 19 bucks richer now because of me This was not at all imaginative there was no redeeming moment anything remotely funny was shown in the trailer and nothing amusing was in the trailer performances were strained especially Molly s totally unconvincing What was theoretically supposed to be some comic relief was the homoerotic friend with a penchant for Disney films none of his analogies hit home his little moral speeches were flat I was literally waiting for them to go on to say something meaningful only to find out he was done The so called hard 10 is the most insipid plastic creature there is apart from having a horse like face with a weird smile I honestly found her friend Patty referred to as the Hamburglar to be much better looking than her But then again gentlemen prefer brunettes Well anyway the whole premise is that society is superficial and if love is true it transcends all social facades the way they showed this with a dude shaving another s scrotum and the million times mutilated and beaten to death horse premature ejaculation routine with obvious allusions to American Pie and Happiness the latter in the disgusting scene denouement involving the family dog I feel as if the movie was like adjoining ridiculous jokes into an unformed wretched ball of raw sewage Goes to show marketing can push anything out there shine whatever fetid mass and call it gold people will come worked for me Done with tirade
I thought that this movies was a letdown I expected it to be so much better than it was I am so glad I didn t pay to see this movie and that I didn t sit in a movie theater for this one Where to begin on this movie the acting in this movie was average the humor was terrible and just the overall storyline of this movie wasn t special I thought that this movie was suppose to be great but it wasn t more than a cheesy waste of time I think that the acting in this movie was terrible no of the actors in this movie had chemistry it just wasn t there I think that if maybe we had a different actor play Kirk than Jay Baruchel it might have been better but the entire time I watched this movie he looked high and I didn t get the feeling that he wasn t acting in this movie Now Alice Eve did a great job as an actress but there was no chemistry between her and Jay All the actors in this movie were no names and had very little affect in this movie The humor in this movie was not funny at all there were a few one liners in this movie that were OK but nothing worth saying to your friends that they would understand I think that Jim Field Smith had a hard time with this because he couldn t decide if he wanted a romance or a comedy I honestly think he needs to stick with the Burger King commercials I think that this movie could have been better if the writers would have gone to a different director The storyline of this movie is just like every other hot girl just OK guy love story boring I think that it would have been better if it had more originality but what a letdown nothing I honesty would not recommend anyone go see this movie I think that you would have more entertainment at the dentist than at this movie So save yourself the agony and just don t see it
the characters at depth less rip offs you ve seen all the characters in other movies i promise the script tries to be edgy and obnoxious but fails miserably it throws in some hangover meets superbad comedy but the jokes are way out of left field completely forced and are disreguarded almost completely after they are cracked the hot chick is old and has no personality shes just some early thirties blonde chick with a few wise ass non underwear wearing jokes who is less than endearing the attraction between Molly the hot chick and Kirk the dorky love interest is barely communicated the attraction in no where to be found its a completely platonic relationship until they awkward and predictable seat belt mishap kiss occurs afer this they are in a full on relationship and its just incredibly lame the main focus of this movie is not the relationship but a failed attempt at making a raunchy super bad esquire movie with a semi appealing plot I could compare this to the hangover in its forced nature i wont get into that i could keep going but its just pointless just don t pay to see this movie
Big Bad Ralph is also on the not so squeazy truck commercials and can be found at numerous brothels around Melbourne any given night br br Terrible Film by the way wasn t shocking just bad uninteresting br br The main guy was in charge of the metal section on countdown and was the lead bouncer at a gay night club in Melbourne br br I dunno who the women where probably pros s that Ralph knew br br No story of interest its one of those fast forward jobs br br Please look up Big Bad Ralph at brothels around Melbourne br br hes famous in them br br i wish i could give 0 10 but ill give it 1 Only cos i cant give 0
First up this film according to the slick said it won best film at Worldfest Film festival in Houston Texas Hmmm must have been a quiet year br br Wouldn t call this the worst film ever but it certainly sucks is pretty much just as terrible as other Aussie B grader Body Melt but at least that film didn t look like it was shot on HI 8 video br br My guess is the film makers watched a lot of Troma films and really bad B grade gore films thinking that they too could crack into the business releasing this film br br Don t get me wrong I love really low grade films Just the fact that some of the characters put on fake American accents almost as if doing so would give them more chance to sell it in the states or something Really disappointing ending as well the showdown could have been way more exciting and some good fight scenes You can completely see that the film makers are trying to copy Bad Taste with the whole car explosion rocket launcher and endless amount of people being gunned down yet the finale lacks any over the top humour or style like bad taste br br If you like watching really bad gore films or are interested in no budget film making watch it otherwise stay away
I didnt think it was possible but i have found film worse than Body Melt This film is really really bad And what makes it worse is that its another Australian film br br Shot on what looks like VHS and with a terrible 80 s rock soundtrack it just keep getting worse and worse which is hard to believe seeing how bad the beginning is skinned male hanging up side down in a white tomato sauce sprayed room anyone br br And why do their accents keep changing From bad New York drawl to prissy english then pure Aussie And it happens to the whole cast br br This film also claims to have won some film festival on the cover i believe it was the Utah Film Festival This has to be a lie because no one in their right mind would nominate this for anything perhaps the Golden Rasberries but i thinks its too bad for that aswell br br Come on guys This film has to be number 1 on the bottom 100 It has to be ten times a bad as those films already on there br br Well done to the film makers of this trash for proving there is a reason not to see films 0 10
At first glance this movie has got everything a psycho wants a vampire story with a not under 18 restriction filled with hyper violence drugs gore sex including lesbian sex some fanatics zealots and even a gay necrophiliac cop But then this movie is a succession of bad story so thin bad acting with a ridiculous english accent making you believe you re watching a bad Monty Python bad music 80s hard rock the videotaping is awful the ending is a real shame Plus the scenes of sex are ridiculous the gore not very impressive And those vampires reflect in a mirror and don t even fear daylight You get to be very disappointed unless you see it as a Space Mutiny or Troll 2 I hope Bloodlust will one day reach the bottom 100 because that s its real place br br I d say it can still be fun to watch if you have friends and enough beer br br 3 10
I don t know if the problem I had with this movie is that I was not able to capture the way movies were done in the past but I believe that this one did not miss to make use of any of the the fashionable conventions available in the 40s to make a film If you don t have anything better to do my advise is not to watch this movie but to read a book or to go out for a walk
This is the most depressing film I have ever seen I first saw it as a child and even thinking about it now really upsets me I know it was set in a time when life was hard and I know these people were poor and the crops were vital Yes I get all that What I find hard to take is I can t remember one single light moment in the entire film Maybe it was true to life I don t know I m quite sure the acting was top notch and the direction and quality of filming etc etc was wonderful and I know that every film can t have a happy ending but as a family film it is dire in my opinion br br I wouldn t recommend it to anyone who wants to be entertained by a film I can t stress enough how this film affected me as a child I was talking about it recently and all the sad memories came flooding back I think it would have all but the heartless reaching for the Prozac
Gregory Peck s acting was excellent as one would expect and the cinematography quite stunning even when playing directly into some melodramatic moment But the rest of the film was overacted and hard to watch for me anyway I tried to like it but had to fast forward through the last thirty minutes or so I feel I wasted a couple of good hours Had it not been for Gregory Peck I wouldn t have lasted fifteen minutes 4 10
The only way this is a family drama is if parents explain everything wrong with its message br br SPOILER they feed a deer for a year and then kill it for eating their food after killing its mother and at first pontificating about taking responsibility for their actions They blame bears and deer for misbehaving by eating while they take no responsibility to use adequate locks and fences or even learn to shoot instead of twice maiming animals and letting them linger
Ally McBeal was a decent enough show but it was very overrated The characters become boring after a while and the jokes begin to fall short br br I think it chose an appropriate point in time to leave it was starting to outstay its welcome
What the hell is this Kooky drama Lawyers in Loony Tunes Land The world s thinnest most duck faced actress even more duck faced and anorexic than Michelle Pfeiffer overacts her bony butt off making cretinous grimaces that would shame Bugs Bunny in one of the most animated non animated TV series ever This is also the most annoying one hour format TV show ever hence the worst br br All the men act like pansies and I for one refuse to believe that even hip big city shysters are all as delta male like as this sorry short bunch Wuss Peter MacNicol manages to be even more irritating than Calista Flockofducks with his fake Hollywood shshshs speech impediment it s the sort of pseudo inability to pronounce the letter S by turning it into a moronic SH that the likes of Jon Shtewart and Christian Shlater also practice with zeal Watching MacNicol talk I always wonder how come his jaw doesn t dislocate Human facial anatomy was never meant to support the pronouncing of the SH sound more than three times per second He is a medical wonder br br This badly conceived and written legal drama comedy hodgepodge also features some very 90s PC It has POLITICAL CORRECTNESS written with huge neon letters Is there anything more unrealistic than a bunch of LAWYERS being full of ideals high principles and moral fiber Laughable but that s the way defense lawyers have been portrayed in Hollywood since its inception After all what is more noble than defending a murderer a rapist or a thief When a TV series as retarded as Ally McBeak starts preaching to America about how it should run the country then it must be time for Paris Hilton to become President Ally McQuack is both a product of recent and large scale Western dumbing down and a perpetrator of it br br Those supposed touches of eccentricity like the UNBELIEVABLY annoying musical numbers are unconvincing and embarrassingly unfunny This is no Monty Python Whatever new the talent free makers of this garbage were aiming for they failed with honours Ally McBeak is a highly commercialized TV venture aimed at indiscriminating yuppies bored housewives and bipolar lawyers It s yet another dull objection overruled sustained your Honour may I call the witness legalistic baloney that the American audiences seem to eat up with relish for some strange reason
Mmm doesn t a big stack of pancakes sound good Maple syrup and fruit preserves on top Take a bite Mmmmmmm Take another bite Another Another EAT EAT it you Keep shoveling it down your throat until your face turns green with nausea You have just had the Ally McBeal experience br br I stumbled on this show in the winter of 98 and was instantly hooked Like that stack of pancakes I gorged myself on it But the enjoyment soon wore off because the Ally McBeal character whom we see to be cute endearing at first sight soon becomes the most annoying insecure whining complainer you ve ever met Call me a feminist but I prefer my female leads to have a spine The gags gimmicks of the show also become hackneyed the music of Vonda Shepherd which is really shoved in your face becomes grating and the incessant character changes rewrites make the show into a damn soap opera br br My advice to you is to take this show in small doses and quit as soon as it becomes bothersome and it will I made it through 2 5 seasons before my enjoyment had totally soured It was good while it lasted but like a crazy neurotic ex girlfriend it just turned ugly after it had overstayed its welcome br br And next time you go to IHOP skip the pancakes Order something healthy like the fruit cup It ll sit with you much better

Really when it comes down to it this movie is just not funny Josh Kornbluth is the antithesis of funny and yet he thinks he s hilarious The plot about mailing the 17 letters was fine at first until Josh s look at me I m wacky approach began infesting each and every scene The Judas Priest joke may have been the least funny thing I have ever been privy to and that is saying quite a bit since it does have stiff competition from all the other jokes in the movie And as for the incredible overuse of the Pixies Debaser I have just one thing to say What did the Pixies ever do to deserve a fate like this What did anyone do to Josh Kornbluth to cause him to write direct produce star in such a terrible movie
My wife and I rented this movie because some people had drawn parallels between it and Office Space Blockbuster and IMDB even had it as an also recommended selection if you liked Office Space br br Now I ve seen Office Space probably 15 or 20 times I love it It s probably one of my 10 favorite movies Witty humorous and featuring characters that remind me of people I ve worked with over the years Haiku Tunnel is similar to office Space in that they are both films That s where the similarity ends We sat through probably the first 50 minutes of HT giving it the benefit of the doubt hoping nay praying that it would get better It didn t We couldn t take it any more and stopped the tape Thank GOD it was a free rental I d have been p ed if we d actually paid for it We should be reimbursed for having to sit through it Now since we didn t see the end perhaps it miraculously comes together and redeems itself I doubt it br br Haiku Tunnel is so bad it s hard to believe it ever got produced The movie is SO unfunny it s painful Just mail the friggin letters already The premise is asinine The jokes are awful We got as far as the printer doesn t work scene and had to stop We couldn t take it anymore This film is an EMBARRASMENT for Josh Kornbluth br br If you are a fan of Office Space don t waste your time with this turd 0 10
Office work especially in this era of computers multi functional copy machines e mail voice mail snail mail and temps is territory ripe with satirical possibilities a vein previously tapped in such films as Clockwatchers and Office Space and very successfully This latest addition to the temp humor pool however Haiku Tunnel directed by Josh Kornbluth and Jacob Kornbluth fails to live up to it s predecessors and leaves the laughs somewhere outside the door waiting for a chance to sneak in Unfortunately for the audience that chance never comes so what you get is a nice try but as the man once said no cigar br br As the narrator star of the film Josh Kornbluth playing Josh Kornbluth points out in the opening frames in a monologue delivered directly into the camera this story is pure fiction and takes place in the fictional city of San Franc l isco It s an innovative if not very imaginatively presented disclaimer and not all that funny It is however a harbinger of what is to follow all of which like the disclaimer just isn t all that funny br br Kornbluth plays Kornbluth an aspiring novelist who supports himself working as a temp It s a job that suits him and it gives him time to slip in some work on his novel from time to time But when he goes to work for a lawyer Bob Shelby Warren Keith he does too good a job on the first day and Shelby dispatches head secretary Marlina D Amore Helen Shumaker to Kornbluth to persuade him to go perm The thought of working full time for the same company though initially strikes fear in the heart of Kornbluth but he caves in and signs on for the position He s nervous about it but at least now the other secretaries acknowledge his presence which of course they would never do with a temp and if things get too rough he has seventeen important letters he s typed up that now just have to be mailed out to fall back on he s been holding them back because the mailing is the easy part and he needs that something easy to do in reserve in case it all gets to be too much for him These are important letters however and by the end of the week Kornbluth still has them in reserve on his desk And it doesn t take a genius to figure out that when Shelby finds out about it Kornbluth s days as the fair haired boy are going to be over And quick br br The Brothers Kornbluth who not only directed but along with John Bellucci also wrote the screenplay for this film should have taken a page out of the Ben Stiller Book of Comedy where it says If you play it straight they will laugh But they didn t and the audience won t Because in comedy even looking at it as objectively as possible when the main character as well as most of the supporting characters in this case Plays funny as in he knows he s being funny he never is And that s exactly what Kornbluth does here so rather than being funny he comes across as insincere and pretentious a grievous error in judgment on the part of the Kornbluths because by allowing it they sabotaged their own movie br br In trying to discern exactly why this movie doesn t work it comes down to two basic reasons The directing which if not necessarily bad is at least careless and secondly the performances beginning with that of Josh Kornbluth Quite simply Kornbluth just seems too impressed with himself to be effective here Unlike Stiller or even Steve Martin both of whom use self deprecating humor very effectively Kornbluth apparently has an ego that simply will not allow putting himself in that light he seems to have a need to let his audience know that he the real Kornbluth is in reality much more clever than Kornbluth the character And being unable to get past that does him in as well as the film Rather than give the millions of office workers who may see this film someone to whom they can relate or with whom they can identify Kornbluth affects a condescending manner that only serves to alienate the very people he is attempting to reach So what it all comes down to is a case of poor directing and unconvincing acting and when you take into consideration that the screenplay itself was weak to begin with with an inexplicably narrow focus given the potential of the rich subject matter it s easy to understand why this one just doesn t fly br br The one saving grace of the film is the performance by Warren Keith as Shelby whose subtle delivery is convincing and which in and of itself is fairly humorous The effectiveness of it is diminished however inasmuch as Keith has to share his scenes with Kornbluth which somewhat automatically cancels out his positive contributions to the project br br Shumaker and Sarah Overman Julie Faustino also manage to keep their heads above water with their respective performances which are commendable if not entirely memorable they at least make their scenes watchable and Overman even manages to elevate Kornbluth s performance if only momentarily But it s still not enough to save the day or the film br br The supporting cast includes Amy Resnick Mindy Brian Thorstenson Clifford June Lomena DaVonne Joe Bellan Jimmy the Mail Clerk with a cameo appearance by a disheveled looking Harry Shearer as the Orientation Leader a role that begs for an answer to the question What was he thinking when he agreed to this In any work environment there will forever be situations arising that one way or another will unavoidably become fodder for someone s comedic cannon and the films depicting said situations will always be with us the good ones see paragraph one may even become classics in their own right Haiku Tunnel however will doubtfully remain very long amongst them for it s destiny lies elsewhere in a realm known only as Obscurity I rate this one 1 10 br br br br
This movie is nothing like Office Space except in the premise Office Space was hilarious I would not recommend this movie to anyone as I laughed not once during the entire film Mr Cornbluth s self indulgent tirades quickly become more annoying than 15 Jason Alexanders in the same room If you decide to see this movie use a free rental or watch it at someone else s house so you can leave if necessary
I passed this one on the shelf a few times looking at the myriad of huge positive quotes with tiny names on the front and wondering if I was missing something The other night it was on one of the movie channels and I tuned in I missed nothing br br I must admit that I only watched the first 30 minutes Perhaps the movie becomes comedy gold after that Given the slow plodding pace and complete lack of laughter in the first 30 I seriously doubt it br br The lead character starts the movie in classic I don t know how to start my movie style with a long tiresome monologue about how he doesn t want to get sued It s not funny It s not even remotely funny Others have commented on the San Franclisco bit ok a small chuckle the first time he says it Then he grinds it into the ground smiling at the camera like it s the funniest thing ever written Get over yourself In fact I think the talking to the camera bit was the reason I instantly disliked the film Don t assume familiarity with your audience Familiarity is _earned_ much like respect br br From there you basically have a fat whiny guy talking in a very effeminate way about his dull life as a temp I didn t realize he s Jewish it s a discredit to Jewish comedians to call this Jewish humor It s just unfunny humor Just because you re Jewish doesn t mean you have a knack for the comedy A WASP Spalding Gray does a better job of self analytical humor than this guy so obviously it s not about ethnicity br br If one of the bits I had seen had worked I might have stuck around But some schlub going on about how much he loves the names of the women he works with then listing them for five long minutes doesn t make a great movie br br This is an obvious attempt to capitalize on the popularity of Office Space Don t let yourself become a victim of target marketing Just say no to Haiku Tunnel
After waking up at 3 30 in the morning and not being able to go to sleep I decided that I may as well be entertained while I suffered from sleep deprivation This movie was on HBO and I decided to watch it What a mistake br br Here is the plot potential spoilers if you even care a neurotic man with an addiction to candy Josh Kornbluth works as a temp for some ridiculous company Suddenly he is offered the chance to go perm which seems to be the favorite catch phrase of this movie But with a secure job and a secure income within his grasp Josh decides for whatever stupid reason that he doesn t want to do it He hopelessly bungles several minor tasks and his laziness and lack of ambition fill me with contempt His inability to send several very important letters within a given amount of time is supposed to be hilarious but is merely stupid Josh meets and deceives a lawyer woman and they wind up in bed together obviously a fantasy of Josh s in real life as such a thing would never happen A bunch of other stuff happens but it s too trite and inane to go into now br br Despite the fact that this movie is billed as a comedy I only laughed twice during it the first time was the opening shot of Josh Kornbluth my initial reaction was one of stifling fear and the second was when he was in bed with the attractive woman yeah right Josh Kornbluth is perhaps the most terrifying looking person I have ever seen in my life He is an unattractive overweight balding Jewish man who I am supposed to believe has sex with beautiful women I do not at all sympathize with Josh s character He is lazy and unmotivated and I just don t appreciate the failed attempts at humor Skip it even if your life depends upon it
The worlds largest inside joke The world s largest most exclusive inside joke br br Emulating the brash and everyman humor of office space this film drives the appeal of this film into the ground by making the humor such that it would only be properly appreciated by legal secretaries writing books The audience is asked to assume the unfamiliar role of a legal secretary and then empathize with the excruciatingly dumb protagonist br br The entire film is centered on the legal secretary finding free time listening to music and writing a novel while working These are his goals You can t imagine the slap in the face it is to the audience when around halfway through they find out he has had a job which fit all three of those criteria but then gives it UP The director and screenwriter Jacob Kornbluth and Josh Kornbluth completely remove the audience s motivation to empathize or even find entertaining a protagonist that has previously thrown away that which he is complaining about the lack thereof br br Apart from that major stumbling block the legal secretary insider humor fails because they must be explained explicitly to the audience each time they happen Without these asides the audience wouldn t have noticed anything particularly strange Humor is only effective if it doesn t need to be thoroughly explained to the audience what is funny
I ll dispense with the usual comparisons to a certain legendary filmmaker known for his neurotic New Yorker persona because quite frankly to draw comparisons with bumbling loser Josh Kornbluth is just an insult to any such director I will also avoid mentioning the spot on satire Office Space in the same breath as this celluloid catastrophe I can however compare it to waking up during your own surgery it s painful to watch and you wonder whether the surgeons really know what they re doing Haiku Tunnel is the kind of film you wish they d pulled the plug on in its early stages of production It was cruel to let it live and as a result audiences around the world are being made to suffer br br The film s premise if indeed it has one is not even worth discussing but for the sake of caution I will Josh Kornbluth a temp worker with severe commitment phobia is offered a permanent job His main duty is to mail out 17 high priority letters for his boss But ludicrously he is unable to perform this simple task My reaction Big deal That s not a story it s a passing thought at best one that should ve passed any self respecting filmmaker by br br The leading actor if you can call him that is a clumsy buffoon of a man with chubby features a receding untamed hairline and a series of facial expressions that range from cringe making to plain disturbing Where o where did the director find this schmuck What s that you say he is the director Oh my mistake Playing yourself in your own embarrassment of a screenplay is one thing but I suspect that Mr Kornbluth isn t that convincing as a human being let alone an actor Rest assured this is by no means an aimless character assassination but never before have I been so riled up by an actor s on screen presence My frustration was further confounded by his incessant to camera monologues in between scenes I mean as if the viewer needs an ounce of intelligence to comprehend this drivel Kornbluth insults us further by explaining the action first rule of filmmaking dramatize exposition show don t tell Who does this guy think he is He has no charisma no charm and judging by his Hawaiian shirts no sense of style His casting agent should be shot point blank br br The supporting actors do nothing to relieve the intense boredom I felt with but one exception Patricia Scanlon puts in a very funny appearance as Helen the ex secretary who has been driven insane by her old boss and makes harassing phone calls from her basement while holding a flashlight under her face This did make me chuckle to myself but the moment soon passed and I was back to checking my watch for the remainder of the film br br The film s title is also a misnomer Haiku Tunnel has nothing to do with the ancient form of Japanese poetry Don t be fooled into thinking this is an art house film because of its pretentious sounding title or the fact that it only played in a handful of cinemas and made no money at the box office there s a very good reason for that br br
Watching Josh Kornbluth act in this movie reminds me of my freshman TV production class where the not funny had the chance to prove just how unfunny they really were br br OBVIOUS is the word that comes to mind when I try to synopsize this wannabe comedy The jokes are sophomoric and telegraphed The delivery is painfully bad OUCH The writing is simply dorkish It is akin to a Bob Saget show br br Watching this movie is as painful as watching a one and a half hour long Saturday Night Live skit post Belushi br br I hated this movie and want my money back
The world may have ended Unfortunately this film survived as yet another testament to Canada s inability to make movies that go beyond the execrable Maybe it s because all our really good people Norman Jewison Martin Short et al go to Hollywood In fact it s too bad Short wasn t cast in this apallingly pretentious and banal film He might have given it some credibility The Canadian government should realize and this movie is a magnificent example that shovelling money into the trough does not result in good cinema If the people lapping up these public funds had had to compete they might have been forced to come up with something worthwhile As it is they have produced yet another snickering embarassment
To make any film about the supposed end of the world there should be some facts realism 1 We are never told why these people believe this 2 Location is New Years Eve In Toronto Canada SO PLEASE SOME ONE TELL ME WHY WAS THEN STILL SHINING AT MIDNIGHT WHY based on the costumes DID IT SEEM LIKE SEPTEMBER br br 3 The acting was in that neo au natural style that needed a director who knew how to do it br br 4 the individual story pieces were all dreary without any purpose I could go on But I do not want to make this as boring as the film br br rating 1 2 out of 4 2 on IMDB scale br br thank you I am as always br br JAY HARRIS aka SIRBOSSMAN
Very funny to watch Beretta s Island as kind of natural trash film It is like answer to Jess Franko s type of b movie Bodybuilders strikes back face to face to pushers The very very very stupid strike Action unbelievably bad directed firing shooting scenes look even better than hand to hand fighting Chasing scenes ridiculous Saving beauties scenes incredibly stupid Erotic scenes are very unerotic The main luck of film is pretty landscapes and festival scenes Don t miss Arnold Schwarzenegger s joke at start of film and list of Franco Columbu s kin at the end Special attraction naked bosom Almoust forgot Franco can sing
From the first time I saw the box cover of the movie and the stretched out photography I thought this guy this friend of the Scwarz must be like 6 foot or 6ft 2in br br Not 5 feet tall Not that it s his fault br br At any rating I turned on the movie one cool night in Tucson out on the second story deck with a good cigar and let it roll At that time my wife was having an affair and things were going down hill for me so I needed a good diversion But as bad as the movie was I totally enjoyed it with a bottle of Merlot too I might admit br br Truly I have watched this movie many times It always makes me feel good It s not that it tries too hard to be cool or that It s so close to hitting the mark for an action film It s frantic And then truly clueless Then frantic again It s the best of the best when it comes to a slow speed chase scene Wow I never felt safer in my life Warm and happy too I was thankful that they conserved on the gasoline during the chase due to less production in the summer months anywho br br The direction was uninspired the action and fight sequences needed to be choreographed or re choreographed and tightened up the sound was off the delivery didn t hit you it just kept on going the other way The locals of that village that they were in the town rather were Off cue they also did not seem to follow what was happening very well the would look and even stare into the camera lens Like a deer in the head lights kind of thing only some of them with a smile a smiling deer br br I feel bad because Columbu I just bet has a good heart and a caring spirit for people in America as well as for his own countrymen br br However Baretta s Island is very lethargic and unbelievable Even still I like it a lot My now x wife hates it but I love it br br The funny thing is I am pretty discriminating when it comes to movies I like or even love All in all I like Franco So there it is br br As a movie adding addendum to this if you like killing a few hours with truly fun to watch straight to video B movies or bad movies for your little library collection then if you can find it check out The Big Sweat 1991 with Robert Z Dar you know the big guy from TANGO CASH The Big Sweat a bomb of a cop story with no real plot discovery and acting that is so lame it might as well be on crutches and at the end of The Big Sweat I think they ran out of money because they had a picture of the cast and just set it on fire and let it burn during the credits Good fun br br But all in all not as good as Baretta s Island I gave it a 1 and an overall rating of awful for awful good B movie I m waiting for the sequel maybe like Baretta s revenge on Montazuma Franco takes a Mexican vacation and gets sick on the water then declares war on the water co or Baretta s powder war where as he would stake out a large drug lord in his country and chemically gene splice and create a hybrid super bug insect that would be bred and dropped into the cocaine fields and eat the coke and upon passing it through the bug it forms a chemical reaction that turns the coke to pure powdered sugar Then another sequel he would have to get the young people rescued from excessive sugar addiction and so on He could get a major tooth paste company to endorse and partially fund the project with careful product placement in the feature Right
It s the worst movie I ve ever seen The action is so unclear work of cameras is so poor actors are so affected and this lamentable 5 minutes of Arnie on the screen My advice from the bottom of my heart don t watch it unless you like such a low class torture
Sadly the print of the film we were going to watch burned in the fire at Universal Studios last week so we were stuck with video That could even be a metaphor for this second rate King Kong movie from Toho studios stalwart director Ishiro Honda Essentially it s a warm up for King Kong versus Godzilla It even uses the idea of a Mecha Kong like Mecha Godzilla Of course the movie climaxes with King Kong fighting Mecha Kong on top of the expo tower in Tokyo but if you didn t know that already then maybe you re in the age group that this movie was intended for br br The cast is headed by a guy named Rhodes Reason who we had never heard of glancing over his list I see mostly a lot of scattered American TV credits so it s interesting that they dragged him all the way to Japan so that they could have a nominal American hero The real hero of the movie is the more sensitive Japanese commander played by Akira Takarada who I recognized from Hiroshi Inagaki s iconic version of Chushingura 47 Ronin and also from the original Godzilla films by Honda I m sorry Rhodes Reason whoever you are but this guy has way more screen presence and you can bet that everyone wants him to end up with the cute little blonde played by Linda Miller We laughed at the way Reason would always find a way to interject himself between Miller and Takarada who it seemed like she kind of preferred Of course like all Kong leading ladies her primary relationship is with the King himself She discovers a nice trick if you talk to a giant ape really really slowly he ll understand what you re saying And if you re a blonde gal that means that he ll do whatever you tell him to do That fact is not lost on Dr Who Eisei Amamoto and Madame Piranha Mie Hama representing a nation which shall not be named who plan on using her as bait to get Kong to dig up mineral deposits that are trapped at the North Pole br br Yes this is truly the plot of the whole movie apparently only a giant ape is going to be capable of digging out these minerals which can be used to make super powerful weapons Dr Who builds Mecha Kong to get it but the circuitry gets in the way so they decide to go for the real Kong Kong himself seems momentarily infatuated with Mecha Kong a story element that might have made the film more interesting but wasn t followed up on br br By the end of the movie the cute blonde has shouted Kong or King Kong in her chirpy voice so many times that when the two heroes tell her to let him go at the end they re speaking for all of us Basically this movie squanders whatever majesty was possible in the Kong character by making him a heroic and friendly figure much too early just like the newest version of the story Kong is just a guy in a suit in this movie and they show quite a lot of him to the point where the goofy face becomes impossible to take seriously It s a nice looking movie I m sure it satisfies the demands or desires of fans of this type of thing which is really more of a wrestling film than a monster film in a lot of ways The monsters don t ever really scare in these films they just jump around and push each other around a lot It s not a worthless movie but it s extremely predictable and formulaic so for anyone under the age of 10 or so it probably will only be entertaining as comedy
May Contain Spoilers br br A dude in a dopey looking Kong suit the same one used in KING KONG VS GODZILLA in 1962 provides much of the laffs in this much mocked monster flick Kong is resurrected on Mondo Island and helps out the lunkhead hero and other good guys this time around The vampire like villain is named Dr Who funny he doesn t look like Peter Cushing Kong finally dukes it out with Who s pride and joy a giant robot ape that looks like a bad metal sculpture of Magilla Gorilla Like many of Honda s flicks this may have had some merit before American audiences diddled around with it and added new footage The Rankin Bass animation company had a hand in this mess They should have stuck to superior children s programs like The Little Drummer Boy
KING KONG VS GODZILLA 1963 which I recall having rated BOMB had been my introduction to cult director Honda s work this one isn t necessarily better it s just that I ve learned to be more tolerant towards such intrinsically lowbrow fare br br Here we actually get two Kongs for the price of one an ugly and dopey looking giant ape and a robot variation of it which looks even worse The simian creature lives on the island of Mondo where it s shown fighting a couple of other monsters and befriends a trio of humans Naturally it falls for the blonde and bland heroine in fact more intriguing is a femme fatale in cahoots with the film s villainous mad genius called Dr Who and sporting the anemic look and cape usually associated with a vampire br br He kidnaps King Kong and hypnotizes it in order to retrieve the Element X which is embedded in the icy wastes of the North Pole apparently the giant ape is more impervious to radiation than its mechanical counterpart and to ensure its full co operation Who even captures its three companions The female agent then has a change of heart helps the heroes one of whom typically is a nondescript American and is killed by Who Kong eventually escapes and makes it to Tokyo where it has a final showdown with the robot The doctor flees the ensuing mayhem in his sub which on a request by Kong s dreamgirl is summarily trashed by the giant ape
Oh my God what the hell happened here I m not going to say this again but what sort of backward movie is this The dubbing in this is way worst than the dubbing in King Kong vs Godzilla Linda Miller had to be the worst actress in it and the suits are really cheesy Its about some villain called Dr Who who gets henchmen to build a robot gorilla that has the same strength as King Kong but when this robot breaks down he builds another one and then tries to kidnap Kong When he does thats when Linda Miller gets annoying he makes Kong his slave but everything goes wrong and King Kong escapes Then Dr Who sends the robot after him br br Later when I was watching the movie I got a headache when Linda Miller and the other clowns started moaning As I sat through the misery of watching the DVD while it was playing I was hoping that the madness in the movie was going to end until the fight The ending has to be a really bad one because they could ve shown Kong back on his island fighting dinosaurs again br br Don t watch the movie under any circumstances or if you do beware of the disappointment you will receive
Before I start I _love_ Eddie Izzard I think he s one of the funniest stand ups around today Possibly that means I m going into this with too high expectations but I just didn t find Eddie funny in this outing br br I think the main problem is Eddie is trying too hard to be Eddie Everyone knows him as a completely irrelevant comic and we all love him for it But in Circle he appears to be going more for irrelevant than funny and completely lost me in places Many of the topics he covers he has covered before I even think I recognised a few recycled jokes in there br br If you buy the DVD you ll find a behind the scenes look at Eddie s tour interesting in places but not very funny and a French language version of one of his shows Die hards will enjoy seeing Eddie in a different language but subtitled comedy isn t very funny br br If you re a fan of Eddie you ve either got this already or you re going to buy it whatever I say If you re just passing through buy Glorious or Dressed to Kill you won t be disappointed With Circle you probably will
William Lustig s followup to Maniac proves conclusively that without Tom Savini s spectacular effects and Spinell s convincing performance Maniac would never have become the cult hit that it did Vigilante is badly directed with a simple minded script that spells everything out for you and is predictable at every turn and also mediocre performances by all the actors Judging from the sense of deja vu this film gave me Lustig had watched Death Wish several times too many before making this 1 2
A police officer Robert Forster in a crime ridden city has his wife attacked and young son killed after she dares to stand up to a thug at a petrol station After the murderers get off scot free thanks to a corrupt judge and he himself is jailed for 30 days for contempt of court he decides to take matters into his own hands by joining a group of vigilantes led by a grizzled looking Fred Williamson These Robin Hood types sort out any criminal that the law is unwilling to prosecute and with their help he attempts to track down those that wronged him br br This film is nothing but a big bag o clichés The only thing out of the ordinary is the on screen slaying of a two year old boy which was pretty sick Otherwise it s business as usual for this genre e g involves lots of car chases beatings and shootings mixed in with plenty of male posturing I could have done without the prison fight in the shower involving all those bare a ed inmates though Also did they run out of money before filming the last scenes I mention this because it ends very abruptly with little closure If anyone knows give me a bell actually don t bother br br To conclude File under Forgettable Nonsense Next
Robert Forster normally a very strong character actor is lost at sea here cast as a New York family man seeking revenge on the thugs who murdered his son and attacked his wife in a home invasion Scary subject matter exploited for cheapjack thrills in the Death Wish vein It isn t difficult to scoff at these smarmy proceedings the dialogue is full of howlers the crime statistics are irrevocably dated and the supporting characters are ridiculously over written particularly a despicable judge who allows an accused murderer to walk right out of the courtroom Low rent production is contemptible in its self righteousness especially as the violence in our cities has only increased from
How wonderful Yet another movie about America by someone who has visited here probably a half dozen times a day a piece and believes himself to be an expert on the country Sheesh I should take a trip to Germany for a week and then come back and make a movie about Germany as the land of Nazis or some such Wim IL boy you should get together with Lars von Trier and make the ULTIMATE movie about the Americans Of course we all know it takes a pretentious left leaning we are the world European to make a real movie about America br br Yeah right For a continent that started not one but TWO world wars Europe sure has a lot of opinions about America s wrong foreign policy br br P S Don t worry Wim IL boy there s plenty of UC Berkeley Americans that ll just love your movie Of course these are the same people who thinks George W Bush is worst than Hitler and that a painting of a can of soup is sheer genius
Land of Plenty is not a film It is a tombstone for the directorial career of German Director Wim Wenders br br Many felt it in The Million Dollar Hotel and now Land of Plenty makes it perfectly clear not only has Wenders lost it he s actually turned into a BAD director creating horribly weak and superficial stories and scenes br br One might argue that the time you lose it comes for every director but Wenders case is extreme It s as if he completely forget everything he knew about cinema and started all over again only to get sloppish results br br In a few words this film does not deserve your time
The hysterical thing about this movie is that according to the director it has difficulty finding a distributor in the U S because most of them that viewed it couldn t reconcile the seemingly conflicting messages of Christianity and American angst The thought of anyone seeing this as a religious film in anyway is laughable br br Because a minister at a mission prays with the homeless or wishes someone Godspeed this makes it a Christian movie One could interpret that it is actually mocking religion for in the Land of Plenty with all of its material excess the best an organized mission can do is hand out a bowl of soup and a bible verse Plenty of unfortunate or downtrodden maybe Plenty of useless homeless missions How about plenty of psycho Vietnam vets As a pill popping delusional survivor of agent pink are we to think America is a Land of Plenty of paranoid patriots Maybe we have plenty of psychiatric patients Certainly we don t have plenty of people concerned about Palestine politics based on the main characters phone conversation in the film Of course if you worked in a German homeless shelter the unfortunate there would be much more concerned about peace in a distant land than their own personal survival as the world knows how Europe is the Continent of Plenty when it comes to sophistication br br Indeed I agreed with the title in the end as the United States is the Land of Plenty and in this particular case it refers to the abundance of poor scripts amateur acting and dispassionately directed films Life is too short and one even an American doesn t have plenty of time to waste watching this piece
Wenders was great with Million Hotel I don t know how he came up with this film The idea of giving the situation after spt11 and the view of American Society is hopeful that makes it 2 out of ten But this is not a movie Is that the best someone can do with a great idea the west east clash There are important things going on in middle east and it is just issued on the screen of a MAC with the fingers of an Amerian girl who is actually at the level of stupidity because she is just ignorant about the facts The characters are not well shaped And the most important thing is the idea that is given with religion is somehow funny to me At the ending scene Lana says lets just be quiet and try to listen And the background music says I will pray The thing is not about religion actually But it ends up with this How you are gonna see the truth if you just close your eyes and pray The lights are already shining on the truth Its just that nobody wants to see it ps My home is not a place It is people The only thing that gets 10 out of 10 is that sentence But it is wasted behind this film making by the way as someone mentioned below Americas finest young man are not finest they are just the poor and the hopeless ones who sign up for the army in need of good paychecks which is not provided by the government
The End of Violence and certainly the Million Dollar hotel hinted at the idea the Wenders has lost his vision his ability to tell compelling stories through a map of the moving picture The Land of Plenty seals the coffin I m afraid by being a vastly unimaginative obviously sentimental and cliché d film The characters are entirely flat and stereotyped the writing plot and direction are amateurish at best For the first time in quite a while I was impatient for the film to end so I could get on with my life The war torn delirium of the uncle the patriotic abstract gazing at the sky at the conclusion it all just struck me as being so simple and pathetic hardly the work of a filmmaker who once made some compelling magic on screen What happened The days of experimentation perceptive writing and interesting filming possibilities are long behind him I m afraid Let s hope he finds his inspiration again At the Toronto film festival which is where I saw the film Wenders was there to introduce it Completely lacking in humility he offered us the following I hope no wait I KNOW you re going to enjoy the next two hours I m afraid he couldn t be more wrong
With a tendency to repeat himself Wenders has been a consistent disappointment ever since he hit it big with Paris Texas br br Land of plenty is no exception Taking into the fact that I anticipated an average mediocre film even before I went in Wenders ambitions seem to always get the better of him It s taken for grated now his films are heavy handed and bombastic br br I weren t sure if I was watching a comedy that mocks Middle America or some thriller The outcome of Diehl s character is wholly predicable Wender s insistence on layering many many scenes with some rock song is also intensely annoying He was covering up the holes in his script and direction by jazzing up the scenes br br I am certain that many people will find this film important and resonant but in all honestly this clumsy and didactic effort only speaks of poor direction br br Interesting that Wenders professed that while making Paris Texas he had great help from Sam Sheppard with the script Yes that was Wenders best and he should understand now he needs a good scriptwriter His films from the past 15 years were a total mess
Watching Der himmel über Berlin as a teen in the late 80 s was a profound experience for me so this was what the movies could be Along with Paris Texas and Until the End of the World it still holds a special place in my heart and mind a testament to the genius of Wim Wenders br br Unfortunately later years has seen a steady decline in the quality of his work with Million Dollar Hotel and Land of Plenty hitting a terrible low point Gone are the captivating pictures or music No search for or display of great insight All that is left are characters and thinly veiled political statements that boils down to nothing but clichés and quite frankly mock the intelligence of a mature audience br br Has the well run dry Whatever the reason it s time for Mr Wenders to either step it up or stop altogether
I get it the Diehl character is s posed to be a microcosm of America itself seeing Arab terrorists under every rock only to find out at the end that it s his own actions all along that got him into that siege state and truly if he practices good will to all men everything will be rainbows and lollipops Sorry Wim you have made amazing movies in the past that stay neutral of the politics and for good reason polemics are your weak point and they weaken this a well made amazingly filmed movie with absurd characters dialog and plotting Better luck on your next flick Another thing that yanked my crank was the belabored point of the homeless section of LA being there for reasons of hunger these people don t get enough to eat Truly these folks aren t eating regally but the real hunger these folks is a spiritual hunger an emotional hunger a mental hunger They need self respect self worth dignity which you can t give a man Yeah those folks are hungry and if they need it it is available Less the center for hunger in America I would say it s more the center for alcoholism drug abuse mental suffering and economic devastation Dealing with hunger although a noble endeavor is band aiding a more profoundly systematic societal and age old human problem of homelessness Bill Diehl was good though and Michelle Williams was cute as the young yet cliched old soul
This is an interesting left turn for Reel 13 Indies TWO HARBORS is a B W 75 minute film from Minnesota that features non actors and is about two people finding a connection through a search for alien life I applaud the boldness of the Reel 13 programmers of thinking out of the box when selecting this film I just wish they had picked a stronger film to be bold with As a matter of fact I wonder if the choice had more to do with the uniqueness of the film than with the actual quality of the film itself Not that TWO HARBORS is completely without merit but I ll get to that a little later br br As is common with independent films TWO HARBORS is limited in terms of location There are only two real locations a large junk dealership market and a very teeny trailer which is the home of the middle aged main character Vic played by Alex Cole Writer director James Vculek uses the market setting to provide exposition about Vic who is one of the dealers there He has various people walk up to Vic and start very long conversations that provides us with just two pieces of information Vic sells space toys he prefers to call them outer space action figures and he is a caustic asshole This is emblematic of one of the two key problems with TWO HARBORS all the chatting I ve said it before and I ll say it again we are dealing with a visual medium and filmmakers need to work harder to tell their stories visually There are exceptions of course but generally endless patter is not so engaging on film particularly if the dialogue is being used as exposition Pretty much all the conversations in the film are long and unnecessarily verbose A notable example would be a few scenes which feature Vic trying to play himself off as a Boy Scout leader in order to get a discount at a store He argues with the clerk back and forth and these scenes don t even advance the plot one iota This is the kind of thing that makes even a 75 minute film feel long br br The other problem with TWO HARBORS is the acting I may be a bit of a curmudgeon when it comes to performance in film but I really don t feel like there s a good excuse for not having good actors in your films There are plenty of good actors out there many of which willing to work on low budget projects even in Minnesota Many filmmakers eschew the importance of acting ability as being secondary to their visuals but that is naïve In narrative film making next to the story nothing is more important than the acting performances If you don t believe the people enacting your story your audience is lost br br Originally I thought Vculek was using non actors but as the film went on I decided that they were probably community theater type actors It wasn t that they were uncomfortable on camera It s that they were overly theatrical i e big Granted the best of the actors were the two leads Cole and Catherine E Johnson as Cassie a lonely young girl that gets caught up in Vic s extra terrestrial hunt They seemed to have the most training but they were still a little rough around the edges The eccentricities they displayed seemed to be surface only not coming from a real organic place within Ms Johnson in particular is an interesting case She definitely has a presence a Midwestern charm about her but that charisma belies the multitude of issues her character is supposed to have She struggles to portray the idiosyncrasies that stem from a supposed life of solitude and slave labor relying on stock gestures like eye rolls lip biting and stammering to suggest her discomfort with the outside world br br I mentioned in the first paragraph that TWO HARBORS is not completely without merit and here s what I mean Without giving too much away there is a fade to white an hour into the film After that the story takes a stunning turn which allows the last fifteen minutes to be evocative and downright powerful it s like a sucker punch to the gut but in a good way It s almost a huge relief to feel something after so long with these characters The last five minutes of the film don t have any dialogue at all and the result is the best part of the film subtle detailed Cole does his best work of the film and most importantly cinematic Then with the closing credits comes the most staggering revelation of all that it s based on a true story which got me to thinking With all the dialogue the minimal locations and the lack of cinematic qualities it occurred to me that with two kick ass actors and a tightening re write TWO HARBORS might make a really kick ass stage play maybe even a one act If there are any bold theater producers out there reading this I definitely recommend seeing if you can get a hold of the film and contact the filmmaker Reel 13 or whomever There might be something to this story after all br br For more information on this or any other Reel 13 film check out their website at www reel13 org
I think I found the most misogynistic film of all time Darklight br br The gist of the film Lilith was Adam s first wife and she was considered imperfect and banished from the garden of Eden because she considered herself Adam s equal and refused to submit to him See I took those words straight from the script Then the film keeps going on and though she is the heroine of the film the only time that she becomes acceptable is when she does what the men tell her to do She ends the film under the control of The Faith an all male group br br Other than that the script was predictable and the FX were awful Apart from the obvious hatred of females that is usually a lot more subtle in modern film there was nothing original about Darklight
What is interesting is that the acting was not bad just not enough It was rather lame special effects nor the lines were the single culprit for this failure Standing alone they weren t horribly bad but put together was a tragic move The show seemed long winded and slow with special effects apparently designed to speed the movie along but it failed totally br br Much of the blame for this disaster was put on special effects Don t believe it they were kinda cool Appleby was not the best choice for this endeavor Though she may have been all they had to chose from with a bit of fan recogniton An experienced actress would have brought something to the part like Appleby never did Scfi puts out some really good original movies it s just too bad that this failed so drastically
I sat glued to the screen riveted yawning yet keeping an attentive eye I waited for the next awful special effect or the next ridiculously clichéd plot item to show up full force so I could learn how not to make a movie br br It seems when they set out to make this movie the crew watched every single other action science fiction shoot em up good vs evil movie ever made and saw cool things and said Hey we can do that For example the only car parked within a mile on what seems like a one way road with a shoulder not meant for parking is the one car the protagonist an attractive brunette born of bile is thrown on to The car blows to pieces before she even lands on it The special effects were quite obviously my biggest beef with this movie But what really put it in my bad books was the implausibility and lack of reason for so many elements For example the antagonist a flying demon with the ability to inflict harm in bizarre ways happens upon a lone army truck transporting an important VIP Nameless security guys with guns get out of the truck you know they are already dead Then the guy protecting the VIP says Under no circumstances do you leave this truck do you understand me He gets out to find the beast that killed his 3 buddies he gets whacked in an almost comically cliché fashion Then for no apparent reason defying logic convention and common sense the dumb ass VIP GETS OUT OF THE TRUCK A lot of what happened along the course of the movie didn t make sense Transparent acting distanced me from the movie as well as bad camera work and things that just make you go Wow that s incredibly cheesy Shiri Appleby saved the movie from a 1 because she gave the movie the one element that always makes viewers enjoy the experience sex appeal
The story behind this movie is very interesting and in general the plot is not so bad but the details writing directing continuity pacing action sequences stunts and use of CG all cheapen and spoil the film br br First off action sequences They are all quite unexciting Most consist of someone standing up and getting shot making no attempt to run fight dodge or whatever even though they have all the time in the world The sequences just seem bland for something made in 2004 br br The CG features very nicely rendered and animated effects but they come off looking cheap because of how they are used br br Pacing everything happens too quickly For example Elle is trained to fight in a couple of hours and from the start can do back flips etc Why is she so acrobatic None of this is explained in the movie As Lilith she wouldn t have needed to be able to do back flips maybe she couldn t since she had wings br br Also we have sequences like a woman getting run over by a car and getting up and just wandering off into a deserted room with a sink and mirror and then stabbing herself in the throat all for no apparent reason and without any of the spectators really caring that she just got hit by a car and then felt the secondary effects of another exploding car Are you okay asks the driver yes I m fine she says bloodied and disheveled br br I watched it all though because the introduction promised me that it would be interesting but in the end the poor execution made me wish for anything else Blade Vampire Hunter D even that movie with vampires where Jackie Chan was comic relief because they managed to suspend my disbelief but this just made me want to shake the director awake and give the writer a good talking to
A good idea badly implemented While that could summarize 99 of the SciFi channel s movies it really applies here I love movies where a good back story is slowly revealed and I like action movies and I like all of the main actors so this could have been great However despite some good acting this movie fails due to Bill Platt s bad writing and directing br br Another review made the good point of needing to know where you re going so you can get there This movie doesn t It s put together in such a haphazard way that you know the words second draft are not in Bill Platt s vocabulary There is one scene that is entirely unnecessary and could be removed without anyone noticing This scene even begins and ends with them driving a car so you could cut from one car scene to the other and never have missed the pointless scene in the middle br br This movie also had a strange habit of under explaining some details while over explaining others some to the point where you can guess the entire plot up front It also had a habit of aborting a fight early probably just because they couldn t afford it There are also a few laughably bad scenes where the plot is revealed on a computer and the final battle involving conveniently placed toxic adhesive seriously what is that br br If you are a fan of Shiri Appleby watch this movie because she s OK She does manage to break out of her Roswell persona a few times and make for a good tough chick but not always John De Lancie plays the same character he plays in everything he s ever done since playing Q back in ST TNG so that s nothing new br br In all I gave this movie a 4 10 rating
Shiri Appleby is the cutest little embodiment of evil turned good girl demon kicking Buffy clone Elle But I m getting ahead of myself you see Lilith was the first woman made by god as a companion to Adam But she got all uppity evil feminist so god banished her from Eden A clandestine order known as The Fath captures her but doesn t kill her so now with amnesia which is not really explained that well Lilith now Elle is free to become the aforementioned Buffy clone who has to battle with a mad scientist who got an injection of Lilith s blood br br If the previous paragraph sounded hideously convoluted that s because it is The movie is also dull generic and for a film with a plot steeped in theology it doesn t seem to know a lick about it This bargain basement lousy CGIed movie was apparently a failed series pilot All I can say to the fact that it didn t get picked up is a resounding Amen br br My Grade D br br DVD Extras Commentary by Writer Director Bill Platt and Co writer Chris Regina and Stills gallery video effects samples before after it also has an also available selection that you would THINK would lead you to some trailers but nope on DVD covers for other films which is a stupid idea br br DVD ROM extras Final shooting script and Deleted scenes transcript both in PDF format
This obvious pilot for an unproduced TV series features young Canadian actress Shiri Appleby as an amnesiac with some pretty incredible powers that must be put to use when a man turned flying demon is let loose on the world The CGI is par for a TV job and Appleby is OK as an amnesiac but hard to swallow as a superheroine Familiar TV face Richard Burgi is along for the ride as Appleby s mentor but he can do nothing to elevate this dreck above the mediocre level We see way too much of the cartoonish flying demon right from the start a bad sign Also the scenes where Burgi is training Appleby for battle are actually laughable They are a bad copy of similar scenes in several other movies most notably REMO WILLIAMS
Yuck I thought it odd that their ancient book on curses was made using a common script font instead of hand written The acting is so apathetic at times and so over dramatic at other times Why would a demonico kill the two suspiciously quiet doctors who helped make him immortal Just for the heck of it And is it really necessary to show Lilith s motorcycle whenever she s out somewhere We get it You spent a little bit of money to rent some third rate crotch rocket It doesn t mean you have to show it all the time The Faith s lair looks like an old school Battlestar Galactica set with some last minute changes There is a scene where we are introduced to a few people on a talk show for about 30 seconds before they are killed without apparent reason and without importance Everyone is a throwaway character Forgettable characters and an even more forgettable plot make this one of the most ill conceived movies I ve seen the SciFi channel come out with Stay away unless you re into bad movies
Genghis Cohn is a very mildly entertaining British movie about a German police commissioner in the late 1950 s who is haunted by the ghost of a Jewish comedian that he killed 15 years earlier while serving under Hitler in the SS The ghost comes back and wants his killer to live as a Jew to atone for the murders he committed br br Otto the German policeman actually knows this ghost s name because the last thing he did before he died was said in Yiddish Kiss my ass The policeman didn t speak Yiddish so he asked around until he found the meaning The kiss my ass left such an impression that everybody involved with that killing learned and remembered the comedian s name Genghis Cohn br br There are a bunch of men who are murdered in the jurisdiction of the police commissioner and there are no helpful clues The men are murdered with a set of knives that are missing from the local butcher The butcher announces that his knives are missing while the commissioner is in the store to get a liver and onion sandwich so the commissioner is a suspect The first man is killed while making love to the butcher s wife so the butcher is a suspect But the butcher maintains that he would be very busy if he killed every man that slept with his wife All the men are killed immediately after the climax of lovemaking br br I think I might be a bit angrier than the ghost of Genghis Cohn if I was killed like he was He seems to be very good natured about it as if he was just in a mild car accident I can only guess that it is because it is a British movie and they are known for being a very polite people He uses some of his material from his stand up routing and I just didn t find it very funny br br I gave this movie a 4 because it was just kind of goofy I thought it should have been a little more serious than it was The movie turns out to be a murder mystery where did this come from and it seemed that Genghis should have been more helpful than he was The movie gave me a tiny look into Jewish culture but was only skin deep Do all Jews love liver and onion sandwiches Do they all say shtoop and meshuganah in their daily vocabulary Isn t there more important stuff that we should know about the culture br br I saw this movie at a Jewish community center in Berkeley CA and I was the only person in the room whose hair was not fully gray or white I have no gray or white hair There were 18 of us and after the movie they stayed for about 20 minutes to discuss the movie There were 2 main concerns expressed there 1 The movie was way too light hearted and future generations might not understand the gravity of what happened and 2 As the Holocaust survivors are dying off future generations will not know what really happened I thought that this second concern was ridiculous and I told them I thought they didn t need to worry because there is tons of literature out there and there will always be people who like to watch movies like myself The murder of 6 000 000 people by a very bad man will not ever be forgotten I write this last paragraph because they charged me with telling others about my experience that day
This seemed to be a good movie I thought it would be a good movie and throughout the movie I was hoping it would be a meaningful use of my time and yes I have to admit that the acting talent of Dimple Kapadia and Deepti Naval where truly commendable but despite the best effort this movie falls short of effectively conveying a meaningful message which it seems is it seemed was what Somnath Sen is trying to do The final point comes short and the ending seemed kind of unsatisfactory after all that happens a bit like real life in that respect but movies unlike real life ends in about 2hrs and the ending should leave the audience satisfied if indeed that was the director s intention This falls short in that respect and that is what disappoints me the most br br Another aspect that concerned me was the national stereo typing of the American characters they all seem to be carved out of the same block Seems to me that most American characters in Indian English movies are based upon how common Indians themselves perceive Americans to be like and it is clear that no effort has been made to bring any sense of depth or complexity to any American in the movie br br These two aspects put together they make for a disappointing story
this has got to be one of those films where the trailer is 50 times better than the movie itself I first saw the trailer in 1991 it looked great Since then i have always wanted to see it but could never find it until today yes 14 years later br br lets just say I was so disappointed its unreal OK i knew it wouldn t be an Oscar winner but still had hopes that it would be a fun no brain film in the bloodsport mold Unfortunately it was not it s Pooh br br whats with all the American rock and roll music and the acting was so bad it was quite frightening br br The fight scenes were rubbish and look fake br br this DVD only cost me 5 and I believe I was overcharged by 7 br br Now I m sad as I know that I will never get that hour and a half back
Oscar Wilde s comedy of manners perhaps the wittiest play ever written is all but wrecked at the hands of a second rate cast Sanders is as one would expect casually indolently brilliant in the role of Lord Darlington but the rest of the cast makes the entire procedure a waste of time Jean Crain attempts a stage accent in alternate sentences and the other members of the cast seem to believe this is a melodrama and not a comedy indeed the entire production has bookends that reduce it to tragedy doubtless the Hays office insisted Preminger s direction seems to lie mostly in making sure that there are plenty of servants about and even the music seems banal Stick with the visually perfect silent farce as directed by Lubitsch or even the 2004 screen version with Helen Hunt as Mrs Erlynne or try reading the play for the pleasure of the words But skip this version
I can sum this movie up using 20 words or less Way too predictable of a story line with potential to be funny but instead falls flat on its face See 19 words however I didn t completely pan this flick with just one star but instead decided to bump it up to two stars due to the fact that Julie Bowen is smoking hot and provided just enough eye candy to keep me from ripping the DVD right out from the machine and blowing it up with an M80 My advice take the 4 00 rental fee you would have paid to see this movie and just send it right to me as an advance thank you for saving you the time and frustration of having to sit through this train wreck or you may want to send me the 50 00 replacement fee you would have been charged from taking out your twelve gage to use this piece of garbage as skeet shooting practice
Some illegal so called asylum seeker comes to Stuttgart and finds that Germans are racist br br This is just another already forgotten steaming nugget in a long list of post WWII anti German propaganda films aimed to make Germans feel bad for not welcoming each and every degenerate in their country so he can chase German blonds and sell drugs to German teenagers br br If you re looking for good German films in General see Der Tunnel Der Untergang Europa Europa and Lola rennt br br But not this br br Also Das Experiment with the same male actor from Lola rennt
An illegal immigrant resists the social support system causing dire consequences for many Well filmed and acted even though the story is a bit forced yet the slow pacing really sets off the conclusion The feeling of being lost in the big city is effectively conveyed The little person lost in the big society is something to which we can all relate but I cannot endorse going out of your way to see this movie
RUN do not walk away from this movie Aimed at the very young kids this movie will bore you to tears If the Gamera trilogy of the 90 s raised the bar this film just lowered it It s slow paced and the monster fighting is good but seldom seen This movie had me dry heaving in the cat box Just a very poor offering after a phenomenal 90 s series br br SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT Here are the top 10 reasons Gamera fans of the 90 s series will HATE this film br br 10 This movie is a drama that follows a kid trying to cope with the death of his mother and fears losing baby Gamera to a fight after knowing his father saw the adult Gamera die br br 9 You see the adult Gamera for maybe a minute at the beginning of the film He gets his butt kicked by a few Gyaos and self destructs He looks old and lethargic Plus he looks nothing like any gamera you ve ever seen His suit looked cheap and rushed br br 8 The young Gamera you see through the rest of the film looks like a Pokemon Big eyed and cute it will remind you of the baby Godzilla from Godzilla vs MechaGodzilla 2 Gamera is now too cute br br 7 This movie has the pace of watching a NASCAR race during a 3 hour rain delay I watched this movie with 2 other Gamera fans and nobody was happy with how slowly this film moved along I ve seen an SUV full of fat people going up a mountain road move faster br br 6 Like Godzilla Final Wars this movie had very little kaiju time on screen Final Wars had much more actually and better fights although short br br 5 Kids take the title role The friend of all children theme and poor writing killed the original Gamera series in the 1970 s and history repeats itself in the 2000 s The most successful Gamera films abandoned the Sesame Street feel and went to a darker place Why go back to a failed formula This was to be a new trilogy and poor ticket sales killed any hope for this story to continue thank god br br 4 Gamera lost his iconic roar He now sounds like an Elephant with strep throat br br 3 This movie may produce a new Olympic event Imagine a relay race that involves sending very young children into harm s way You have to see the ending to understand this point Where were the parents Oh yea right there sending their kids into a kaiju battle zone br br 2 The special effects were good but sub par for a Gamera movie Legion and Iris had better effects The best effect was showing the apple sized baby Gamera fly Not too impressive br br 1 This movie is just not what adult kaiju fans come to expect The director was involved in Power Rangers and it shows It comes off like a cross between ET Always Sunset on Third Street and TMNT Kudos if you know all 3 references br br Rental at best or watch once if you buy it to complete the DVD series
This is a very odd film I wasn t really sure what is was about some N London lowlifes find a mute kid in the woods that they all believe is some kind of oracle and somehow makes them all in their own way change something about their lives that usually ends in disaster The film ended after about 90 minutes leaving me feeling quite unsatisfied almost annoyed at the pointlessness of it all I didn t care about any of the characters none of them get a chance to endear themselves to the viewer br br What was the message Am I being dim It was just too odd What happens to Runner Why does Emilio shoot the kid that made absolutely no sense pointless Can someone help me understand this mess of a film
i am rarely moved to make these kind of comments BUT after sitting through most of rankin s dreadful movie i feel like i have really earned the right to say what i feel about it i couldn t actually make it right to the end and became one of the half dozen or more walk outs about 1 3rd of the audience after the ragged plot woeful dialogue and insulting characterisation became just too much to bear this film is all pose and no art all style and no substance it is weighed down by dreadful acting a genuinely dire script indifferent cinematography and student level production values how it got funded started and finished is a mystery to me i bet you a million quid it never goes on general release the proper critics would tear it apart a really bad film shockingly bad a really really really poor effort AND that is without even mentioning the gratuitous new born kitten gets dropped into a deep fat fryer moment totally meaningless utterly lightweight poorly put together this movie is a dreadful embarrassment for uk cinema
Without question the worst film I ve seen for a long while I endured to the end because surely there must be something here but no The plot when not dealing in clichés rambles to the point of non existence dialogue that is supposed to be street is simply hackneyed characters never develop beyond sketches set pieces are clichéd Worse considering its co director the photography is only so so br br Comments elsewhere that elevate this alongside Get Carter Long Good Friday or Kaspar Hauser are way way off the mark Lives of the Saints lacks their innovation let alone their depth and shading In short their craft A ruthless editor could probably trim it down to a decent 30 minute short but as it stands it s a 6th form film project realised on a million pound scale rambling and bloated with its own pretensions That it received funding surely only because of Rankin s name while other small films struggle for cash is depressing for the British film industry
The Lives of the Saints starts off with an atmospheric vision of London as a bustling city of busy quaint streets and sunshine I was hoping it would maintain this atmosphere but it gets bogged down in a story that goes pretty much nowhere br br Othello works for big fat Mr Karva his crime boss step dad at least I think that is what he is supposed to be because it s never really defined but he does drop kittens into deep fat friers so trust me he s a prick doing scrappy little errands while his skanky girlfriend gives daddy hand jobs One of his colleagues is Runner a black dude who is always dashing from A to B Until the day he comes across almost mute homeless child who grants him his wish of being able to stop running Runner dumps the lost boy in Othello s flat where he promptly starts granting more wishes Keen to have some of his own desires fulfilled Karva has the boy kidnapped But he isn t sure of what would really bring him happiness Is it the innocence of being a child again or is it another hand job Either way I don t want to see the little boy grant him the second br br It just takes ages to get going and there are loads of repetitive scenes The ending tries to be shocking but since there s hardly any back story on investment in any of these characters it only serves as a release for the bored audience br br Writer Tony Grisoni a favourite of Terry Gilliam tries to blend in some kind of religious allegory which ends up being pretentious as all hell ironically If he gave us something more accessible or at least had better explanations for the characters suddenly acting all weird then it would have been a more enjoyable film As it is we are introduced to a bunch of annoying loudmouths who then miraculously seem to develop intelligence when confronted by the mysterious boy Who s origins are never revealed That s just plain irritating br br Aside from sporadic moments of atmosphere and a moody score this film has little to recommend
I had watched The Eye before I watched this one I really liked The eye it was one of the best movies of the recent Asian horror cinema So I picked this Bangkok haunted because it was the same director and it was kind of popular round here But man what a disappointment Bangkok haunted are three stories about love revenge ghosts etc that are no scary at all not even disturbing as The eye was no nothing I can t even fill the 10 lines required for the comment br br 100 boring br br My rate 2 10
Times are tough for Angel Town gangs rule with an iron fist and for reasons mostly unknown Mainly due to embarrassing writing the gangs want a street kid Martine to join the gangs so they beat him up everyday However due to the presence of an Olympic kick boxer Olivier World s lamest actor Gruner named Jacques hope is on the way Angel Town is seriously one of the most inept message movies ever made And I ve seen my share it seems to consist of the idea that all gang infested neighborhoods need are French kick boxers who can t act Worst of all there are so many awkward moments it s just truly hilarious Best of all comes from the exchange between Gruner and Aragon which basically sums up how ridiculous this thing is To Wit You like the fighting Olivier grabs his Asian best friend in a headlock I could kill him right When I want him dead he dies The reason why I don t want him dead is because i m afraid of him and I know that if I kill him his son and wife will kill me that s why he doesn t die br br Of course the fact that it s wrong to kill someone let alone your best friend is of course left out of the equation Odd br br However don t let me make this sound that I hated this movie far from it it s so terrible it s priceless The biggest laughs come at the end in the disastrous finale which sees Grunner going one on one with gang members who the film s biggest logic gap decline the use of pistols Also a handicapped Vietnam vet helps out by shooting his machine gun at the gangs while Gruner kick boxes the rest All of this set to the sound of horrible Mexican accents and surreal energy that make this one memorable for fans of cinematic trash such as this br br The other treat about this movie is that for some reason Olivier Gruner never attends college despite that s the main reason he s here in the states and not in France getting it on with his girlfriend In a graveyard in the film s awkward beginning Angel Town is without a doubt a failure on all conceivable levels but if you laugh at moronic martial arts movies with insane levels of action that make no sense on any level this is the perfect movie for you On the other hand make sure to down tequila like the laughable opening song details Ain t no mercy in Angel Town br br out of 4 Bad
Olivier Gruner stars as Jacques a foreign exchange college student who takes on and single handedly wipes out a Mexican street gang in this obnoxious and racist film which is so horrible that it s laughable Bad acting bad plot and bad fight choreography make Angel Town a Turkey
Oliver Gruner is totally unknown to me My friend showed me this film because he had seen Gruner in what he called a pretty good sci fi film Nemesis So as we watched this we found ourselves fastforwarding through the BS drama parts just to get to the unbelievable action sequences Gruner loves to kick and kick and kick And kick haha br br Gruner character is a graduate student who is forced to stay in a ghetto close to the one that he grew up in He finds himself watching after the boy who lives with him because he really wants to join in the Mexican gang that keeps tormenting his family Instead of joining up Gruner tells the boy to fight back against a gang too crazy Gruner plays a typical Van Damme character who kills everyone or maims them pretty bad and works to rid his block of these gangmembers br br The plot was very cheesy and easy to think of Gruner is probably not very well known because of his script choosing if this movie is anything to compare possible choices to This ghetto is pure hell and I enjoyed seeing the motley crew of characters go through it as if they have a chance against Gruner s character The music was typical action music thumping pianos and timpani swelling guitars which actually wasn t as bad as I make it sound The director really needed to keep the action going instead of taking a break every 5 minutes for a tense family moment br br Ultimately I gave it a 4 10 because it really tried to be an average action film for Oliver Gruner to star in but the overall feel of the film leaves you wanting more closure on what you just saw
My kid makes better videos than this I feel ripped off of the 4 00 spent renting this thing There is no date on the video case apparently designed by Wellspring and what s even worse there s no production date for the original film listed anywhere in the movie The only date given is 2002 leading an unsuspecting renter to believe he s getting a recent film br br This movie was so bad from a standpoint of being outdated and irrelevant for any time period but precisely when it was made that I m amazed that anyone would take the time and expense to market it as a video It might be of interest to students studying the counter culture of the 1960 s the anti war anti establishment tune in turn on and drop out culture but when you read the back of the video case there s no hint that that is what you re getting If you do make the mistake of renting it though it is probably best viewed while on drugs so that your mind will more closely match the wavelength of the minds of the directors Fassbinder and Fengler Regardless of your state of mind while watching it I can tell you that it doesn t get any better after the first scene so knowing that I m sure you ll be fast asleep long before the end
I sat through almost one episode of this series and just couldn t take anymore It felt as though I d watched dozens of episodes already and then it hit me There s nothing new here I ve heard that joke on Seinfeld I saw someone fall like that on friends an episode of Happy Days had almost the same storyline ect None of the actors are interesting here either Some were good on other shows not here and others are new to a profession they should have never entered Avoid this stinker
Billy Chung Siu Hung s the bloody swordplay film Assassin from 1993 film Love To Kill Hong Kong 1993 is among the strongest products of the Category III boom that inhabited the HK cinema in early nineties It consisted of films with strong sex nudity and violence more or less gratuitous and shock valued only Love To Kill definitely belongs to the more category with some unforgettable ideas and pieces of celluloid sickness br br The HK psycho Anthony Wong from the award winning The Untold Story by Herman Yau from the same year plays a business man and a husband who likes to torture humiliate and rape his young wife Elizabeth Lee Mei Fung who for some reason doesn t leave him and save herself and their little son from the disturbed tormentor A policeman Danny Lee the famous police character actor from films like Dr Lamb 1992 by Billy Tang and co directed by Lee and The Killer 1989 by John Woo to name just a few however sees the problem and starts to protect the wife and the son but Anthony naturally doesn t like this at all and leads it all into the typical ultra mean spirited and graphic finale during a rain storm br br The film is almost completely without any serious merits as it s just a piece of exploitation in order to cash in when these kind of films were so popular The imagery and happenings are something never found in the Western cinema at least in mainstream and it all becomes even more mind blowing when some most taboos for Westerners like violence and perversions witnessed by a child are broken in these films so often that reading the plotlines alone would make most viewers feel sick and that goes perfectly especially for this film too br br The film still has a rather interesting and creepy soundtrack in the tradition of the mentioned Dr Lamb which practically started the whole boom in 1992 Usually the music and soundtrack in HK films is interesting and adds to the imagery especially in these terror films Also the cinematography is worth mentioning as the film bathes especially in the finale in blue colors and camera lenses as does Assassin too and the raging storm is captured nicely on the camera Otherwise there s nothing that would rate the film any higher other than on the nastiness meter br br The actors and actresses are talented and professional and so don t make the film any worse with their acting Still the film has the usual HK humor in it which makes the sick goings on even sicker as some humor is thrown into the soup That includes some jokes about Danny Lee s erection and so on Something that could never be found in the Western serious films either And that thing usually destroys mane otherwise noteworthy HK films as the humor is just so obvious way and attempt to entertain the audience and masses br br The film has a very high outrageousness level as it has numerous scenes depicting the abuse of Wong s wife in various ways She gets raped and molested beaten and kicked by her husband We also get to see some flashbacks from Wong s own childhood which turns out to be equally violent as his own father killed too and turned his young son into what he is now These flashback scenes mostly at the end of the film include also some totally unexpected experiences as the imagery is speeded up for example the hits of an axe and that creates completely insane and mean spirited atmosphere to the scene Again something that only HK exploitation makers seem to be able to come up with The ending itself includes plenty of sudden and shocking gore as the madman wields his axe and meets also some nails for example on his furious way br br The film is also genuinely pretty suspicious in my opinion as the violence and terror is realistically painful and deals with things that should NEVER be taken as entertainment mostly I mean rape The version I saw I ve seen two versions includes a very long and completely nauseating rape scene that just tries to be as sadistic as possible I m not sure does the HK audience really like imagery like this but I think no one with some sense for morality in films entertainment would never accept or make something like it Women get brutalized and killed in the most sadistic and low ways so that the fates of the men seem almost tame when compared to the females br br The other version I saw the newly released DVD in HK without subtitles has this table brutality scene in a much longer form than the subtitled Taiwanese DVD which is otherwise identical to the HK version I ve also heard that the old HK Laserdisc is different from these two and since the end credits are filled with scenes and images not found in the actual film it is impossible to say how uncut versions these that have been released or shown theatrically are Obviously plenty of footage has been cut out possibly even before the theatrical release br br The film is written by Law Gam Fai and Lau Wing Kin the former having written also films like Dr Lamb The Untold Story and Gunmen Kirk Wong 1988 but out of his other films that I ve seen Love to Kill is the most gratuitous Dr Lamb and The Untold Story both are very brutal and violent but have also some attempt to some criticism towards the authorities and men in general as how it is easy to turn into a beast when chasing or fighting one The harrowing torture imagery of The Untold Story the victim being the criminal is very strong and definitely has its impact to change something that may be rotten in the society and among the police for example But there s none of this in Love to Kill it is just honest calculated and fastly made exploitation which is by the way produced by a veteran director Kirk Organized Crime Triad Bureau 1993 Crime Story 1993 Wong br br Love to Kill earns no more than 2 10 from me as I don t have too high appreciation on films like this HK Cinema is meant to be and can be more and films like Love to Kill are only commercial parasites living among the real pieces of the art
This movie is really wack There is really nothing nice I can say about it besides the moral truth expressed in the film s climax concerning people in the neighborhood participating in the fight against crime Besides all that the film had nothing no good shots no good acting and no good script I give this film a F and a 2 out 10
Superhero movies pretty much always suck and this is no exception Its only redeeming quality is the fact the movie COULD have been even worse I would put Batman Robin and Steel above this movie so yes it is that bad br br If your looking for a black superhero check out Blankman its not a serious superhero movie but at least its entertaining
The movie began well enough It had a fellow get hit by a glowing green meteorite getting superpowers telekinesis x ray vision invulnerability flight the ability to speak to dogs superspeed heat vision and the ability to make plants grow large and quickly and fighting crime From there on it s all downhill br br Meteor Man gets a costume from his mom fights with the resident gangs and has many aborted encounters with the gang leaders which serves to set you up for the disappointing overlong and stupefying ending br br It wouldn t be so remarkably bad if it weren t like watching a boxing match where the two fighters pretend to hit each other while the audience stands looking onward while the fighters just continue to dance br br Despite all of this nonsense the movie has good points It states clearly that if you try to take on a gang alone then they ll come back to your home and hurt you It states that gangs communities need to see their real enemies the big bosses that use them for their own ends to crush honest people into a ghetto existence It also states that people do not need superheroes if they are willing to work as a community do destroy the predators that harm them The only message it really lacks is that the voters should ensure their elected officials Rudolph Giuliani Marion Barry Ronald Reagan George W Bush George H W Bush aren t crooks too br br
Let me tell you something about this movie I have seen it twice The first time I was a kid and the movie was quite entertaining to me I really liked it I thought it was funny and interesting and the main character was kind of cool br br I saw it again a few days ago It was horrible Really I don t know why I thought it was funny before but now I didn t laugh at all There was nothing even slightly entertaining It was just dumb The story was weak The acting was nothing special There are great actors in this movie but still the acting is mediocre at best br br What is the worst is the fact that this movie is racist Really Don t get me wrong usually I don t complain about racism in movies However I have seen people complaining about the lack of black men in movies like The Shaolin Temple or about the fact that the only black man in The Street Fighter is one of the bad guys or Whatever you get the point There are people seeing racism everywhere I wonder how would they react to a movie like The Meteor Man Why I will tell you why There are no Asians in this movie There are no white people among the good guys In fact there is only one white guy in the entire movie and he is the leader of the bad guys All the good guys are African Americans Don t get me wrong I don t care is the good guy is black or white or yellow or pink or green What I do care about is the fact that we can barely see a white person in this movie This is the only movie like that that I have ever seen It is just not realistic If there is only one black man in a Japanese movie which is the case with The street Fighter there is no problem in Japan most of the people are Asians But if there is only one white man in an American movie there is some sort of problem in USA most of the people are white It is like filming a Japanese movie with entirely white cast and only one Asian as a bad guy Just not real br br That is it I am giving the movie the rate of 4 10 It would be 1 10 if I hadn t have fun with it as a kid
Well I d be lying if I said that this could easily rival Spiderman or the Batman movies Still it was more appealing to me for it s moral value I first bought the VHS when my son was about 2 years old and it immediately became his favorite My wife and I are avid supporters of Robert Townsend and have been since he used credit cards to finance his first movie Hollywood Shuffle True he needs to take advantage of the talents and knowledge of technical advisors to make the films more believable but his movies are still fun br br Meteor Man provides a hero with an Urban Contemporary feel I always felt that if there were superheroes they wouldn t provide the same scenarios as depicted in the comics Meteor Man is realistic hero with real problems Car broken into bad neighborhood local drug dealing gangs using children for distribution etc The scope of his mission stayed pretty much within the community br br What I found to be truly entertaining outside of James Earl Jones young forever performance was how the neighborhood responded to his newly discovered powers It wasn t long before they had a full agenda lined up for him without his input of course It was hilarious to hear them offer to lend him out to other communities where their extended families lived br br Yes the plot was weak the movie was predictable there was bad acting and continuity was rotten but it ranks 1 with my kids Robert Townsend works to bring movies home so to speak I doubt he ll ever truly be recognized as the talented actor producer director he truly is but there are and will always be those that love him for his efforts br br One point to ponder about the film which I find amusing Throughout the entire battle with Simon no one bothered to call the police Also what mother and father do you know that will watch their son fight from a window My mother would have been right there scrapping by my side toe to toe Dad would be loading his pistol lol br br Rent it and check it out It s worth seeing at least once and good for those of you that are fans of Sinbad Luther Vandross Bill Cosby Big Daddy Kane etc Great job with the cameos Robert
While it does crack the odd good joke the humour is generally quite dry with members of the panel frequently pulling faces or resorting to coarse language and waiting on the crowd to applaud lame enough jokes br br Unlike what an other comment says I don t think this is the best RTE have ever made its really dry and sarcastic Sarcasm is the lowest form of wit there are few truly funny intelligent gags that would make you genuinely laugh out loud People seem to be convinced by the comedians well known names rather than by judging the quality of the gags which aren t really that good Overall its mediocre with some good laughs to be had but often it can be fairly mediocre Its not as good as Jasper Carrot or Dave Allens stuff I find Benny Hill funnier
Absolutely one of the worst movies I ve seen in a long time It starts off badly and just deteriorates Katherine Heigl is woefully miscast in a Lolita role and Leo Grillo manfully struggles with what is essentially a cardboard cutout character The only cast member with any enthusiasm is Tom Sizemore who hams it up as a villain and goes completely overboard with his role The script is dire the acting horrible and it has plot holes big enough to drive a double decker bus through It is also the most sexist movie I have ever seen Katherine Heigl s character is completely unsympathetic She s seen as an evil wanton seductress who lures the poor innocent married man to cheat on his wife It is implied throughout the movie that she s underage and the message that accompanies that plot strand just beggars belief At the end she isn t even able to redeem herself by shooting the man who s obviously ha become demented with rage and guilt but the script allows him to kill himself thereby redeeming himself in the eyes of males everywhere Horrible Don t waste your time
The scenery is pretty and the dog is cute Other than that this film has absolutely nothing to recommend it Jack Warden is pleasantly genial as usual but the script is so awful that even he comes off badly The plot makes no sense the dialogue is dumb and there are numerous smaller faults But the dog is cute
I rented this film thinking it was the sobbingly sad 1959 version I saw as a kid It was not I was therefore very disappointed with what I felt was marginal acting poor character development and most of all failure to highlight the relationship between the boy and his dog In this version the Dog of Flanders is just a cute aside to the movie Get the 1959 version
People love the original story for its ending The Hollywood style ending made this 99 version of A Dog of Flanders just for kids movie I didn t cry this time because the story was too Hollywood Japanese TV series are much better
The Running Jumping Standing Still Film is not a film as such but it is a short series of clips with a comical slapstick theme This film got Richard Lester recognised and paved the way for him to direct the first Beatles film A Hard Day s Night br br Richard Lester directed and wrote the music for his first film in 1959 This film was entitled The Running Jumping Standing Still Film It was intended to be viewed only by those who had aided in its production Since the film was intended to be viewed by Lester and his partners alone a small amount of money and time was invested The sole purpose of this film is entertainment but the main reason for its existence is the fact that it served as an experiment to work the camera The film cost 70 to make and it was filmed in sepia toned film stock in a field on a couple of Sundays All of the shots that were filmed were included in the finished production the finished production is eleven minutes in length br br The Running Jumping Standing Still Film is a comedy about English Sundays and the small hobbies that people do to pass the time All of the events in this film take place in a field A few of these comical events include a woman scrubbing a lawn a man running around a tree stump with a needle to play a record a photographer developing film in a pond an artist aided in painting by the numbers on a model s face a man building a tent an athlete running over the tent and a duel between a man with a knife and a man with a gun Not only does the film poke fun at the hobbies that people do to pass the time away but it also pokes fun at English culture when compared to American culture Another one of several events in this film includes a group of men and a kite which has been constructed out of the flag of the United Kingdom One of the men jumps inside the kite while the other men attempt to fly it and the kite breaks According to Neil Sinyard author of The Films of Richard Lester this event symbolizes the United Kingdom as lesser in power and technology when compared to the United States during the space age According to this scene the British fly primitive kites while the Americans the world power after World War II fly highly advanced rockets and space shuttles
An interesting change from the first one there was more mystery to this movie then the first Even when it ends your asking yourself what happened who was the killer There are some good parts through the movie the first half starts off slow and then in the last half the pace picks up All up the movie is enjoyable The story is 22 years after the events that occured in the first film Norman Bates is out of an asylum and back to the Bates motel but when a woman turns up claiming to be his real mother things start going wrong Perkins plays an aged Norman well again and the scene at the end was excellent he swang that spade awfully hard
Horrendous pillaging of a classic br br It wasn t written convincingly at all why Mary should develop such sympathy for Bates He may be more stable until they start playing pranks with him but he still doesn t help himself at all with his actions inviting a comparative stranger to stay alone with him in his until recently disused motel telling the attractive young girl of his past mental issues lying about the knives etc This in addition to her previous knowledge should have kept Mary extremely wary of him but this somehow doesn t happen just so they can play the mistaken identity murder game later on Which in itself is also ridiculous So and so is the real killer plus her as well also him There were too many contrived twists in order to slap a story on screen when the narrative didn t need extending br br It was good to see Perkins reprising his famous role again but that s about the only small pleasure to be had It s definitely not a patch on Hitchcock and if you have no intention of even trying to get close then you shouldn t be bothering at all
This dumb comedy really does a good job of wasting comedic talent In particular Dan Aykroyd and Howard Hesseman are misused badly here I might have chuckled once or twice during this film but in general it s a boring movie with a little bit of stupidity thrown in for good measure The premise although routine still wasn t bad but once the plot was set the film went nowhere Don t waste your time with this misfire
This is without a doubt the worst movie I have ever seen It is not funny It is not interesting and should not have been made
This movie is so bad it can only be compared to the all time worst comedy Police Academy 7 No laughs throughout the movie Do something worthwhile anything really Just don t waste your time on this garbage
His first movie after longtime friend John Belushi s death Aykroyd shows much fatigue trying to pull off a character that would have been a snap for Belushi br br Instead Doctor Detroit gives us bookish professor Aykroyd masquerading as a weird violent pimp to ward off a rival known only as Mom That s bad enough but he also has classes to teach a school dinner to host four ladies of the evening to protect and a Pimp s Dinner or something like that to attend No wonder Aykroyd seems stupefied most of the time Why should the viewer be alone br br It was on this film that Aykroyd met future wife Donna Dixon At least some good came out of this chaotic mess br br One and a half stars You want good Aykroyd see The Blues Brothers You want bad see Doctor Detroit
You know those films that have you trapped in the cinema You re stuck there in the best seat in the house centre of the row in your own special sweet spot that you swapped three times before you got just the right seat and after about what feels like 13 hours you are still trapped there uncomfortable and itchy thinking When the F is this film ever going to END You know the feeling think of A I and The Village br br Well Visitor Q delivers a weird variant of that feeling I sat there for the first 30 minutes wondering when the thing was going to f ing start It is interminable So Arty it hurts This is the first Miike Takashi film I have watched Apparently he makes films by the dozen and if they are all pretentious w nk like this I suspect it will be the last br br I m not against Pretentious w nk David Lynch is up there amongst the top 10 directors for me but Visitor Q is cut rate cheap and nasty pretentious w nk br br As you may have worked out by now I hated it
This movie was terrible Throughout the whole movie I was puzzled and did not see any point to it I had to go to this site and read the review to finally understand what it was about This movie is not worth watching at all Not only is it sick and revolting but totally STUPID Please don t watch unless you are one of those that likes to watch bad movies If this movie questions Japanese society and their values and roles than this is a country that i would not like to visit or bother to know This is a totally sick movie I did not enjoy it because it made no sense My boyfriend and I sat there waiting to see if it was a horror because that is what it was listed under It was total disappointment
Visitor Q is a failed attempt at black comedy which focuses on what might be the world s most dysfunctional family including physical abuse from beatings to murder to incest to sodomy to necrophilia to a lactating mom who nurses her husband and adult daughter etc The film is so outrageous it garnered some critical praise and established a small cult following However with home video quality and a slapdash production Visitor Q just doesn t hold up even as a curiosity Genitals are blurred out and sanitary appliances clearly visible make up is awful and everything else is amateurish at best A waste of time C
This movie stinks I don t think I have ever seen a movie so strung up on shock value The plot was relatively interesting but the dialog was super flat and the acting was bland This could have been an a good movie I think it just relied on it s grotesque visuals I can usually handle graphic scenes and human taboos but it felt like Miike shot it for the sake of shooting it Just one poorly executed film There just isn t anything to be entertained by watching this film unless you are fascinated by exhausting yourself with explicit scenes of incest pedophilia necrophilia rape self milking parental and sibling abuse and fecal dispersement I think I just sold the film to many of you but I meant it when i said this stinks He has succeeded in other films but I think you d be better off watching someone pooping
There is NOTHING cool hip or clever about this film liking it just reveals an ignorance of true art cinema How can you so easily forget that the central fact of this entire film is that these mean ugly people are SERIAL KILLERS If they have to dismember total strangers in order to be a family again then we don t WANT them to be a family What part of that did you have trouble grasping Why applaud this filth br br THIS silly filth is what you do if you can t do art One s head life must be deeply empty to mistake this shallow viciousness as interesting This is a camera without a brain What really makes an artwork cool is profundity questioning the status quo from a perspective informed by a knowledge of history or in this case a knowledge of ANYTHING would be preferable Instead this is just randomly piling up the ugliest images available in a world in meltdown thanks to just the sort of empty meanness glorified as cool cause it s so far OUT man These same violent events actually HAPPEN every day They are NOT just in the film They refer to actual soul less people who would do those same things to YOU Do you WANT those things done to you A child could have thought this up it required zero imagination it is NOT surrealism This lazy crap has no content is saying nothing it s just the worst of the evening news it is saying nothing new nothing we don t already know It s the emperor s new clothes the director hoping there are enough uneducated children proud of their streak of inhumanity for this sloppy filth to fly I can see director Miike s demented fans now chain smoking teens and twenties drunks covered in tattoos with metal hanging from holes punched in their faces their knowledge base inversely proportional to their intelligence estimate of themselves br br There is NO PLOT to this it is just sheer exploitation of shock value violence There is no hidden meaning anywhere in this poorly made film It is fine to explore a film to see if you can find cinematic devices that are ingeniously artistic BUT you cannot uncover a hidden meaning if one is not THERE To DO that you need to view review a REAL piece of cinema There are PLENTY out there directed by Fellini Bergman Fassbinder Herzog Altman Bunuel Kurosawa Lynch Tarkovsky Peter Greenaway Tarantino Guillermo del Toro Richard Linklater Eisenstein Aronofsky Gus van Sant Soderbergh Shyamalan Ordet Why don t you view a REAL art film by the likes of these giants This wannabe director Miike will NEVER make a film equal to one of the geniuses I just listed because he just doesn t have the talent Anyone could slap together some chaotic crap like Visitor Q Teenagers could throw that together in one afternoon There s no message no meaning no plot nothing to it at all There are long lists of ART Films to learn from but THIS Visitor Q is NOT an art film in any respect It has no content to it It s just one banal horror piled onto another and the point to remember about those hideous crimes is that those things HAPPEN every single day somewhere in the world They are NOT okay because they are just in the film They refer to actual soul less people who would do those same things to YOU Do you WANT those things done to you To others Why Because this world is already ugly enough thanks to people who enjoy thinking about horrific events like this br br There are sooooo many art films out there to use your mind to deconstruct but you are wasting your talents with this piece of crap There IS no deeper meaning There is nothing to analyze why keep trying I ve spent nearly 40 years watching practically every film ever made and keeping up with all the new ones but I ve never seen anything as disgustingly pointless as this It s not imaginative or even shocking because these types of events happen daily all over the world To make this film or even to favorably review it has caused over 50 young airheads who don t know any better to think it s cool They may grow up thinking that convincing others some of whom may end up DOING these things convicted killers often reveal how they started out just this way by being desensitized to the horror of this gruesome inhumanity Trust me on this I know cool and cool this piece of crap AIN T Visitor Q has the FEEL of a genuine SNUFF film and I m still not sure it isn t actually br br Your actions have consequences son The world is awful enough already Some violence like this COULD happen to YOU or to the socially irresponsible director who cranked out this FAKE Art film Believe me you won t be thinking it s Cool when someone is sawing YOUR skull in half
Okay so I get it We re supposed to be horrified The idea has been planted A girl is doing her dad and taking photos of it Call me over the shock rock genre but I call for the explicit detailing of an act before I can fall for this But don t expect me to watch a soft porn and become horrified that she is doing her father I mean hasn t that convention become a bit abused in the adult film industry already infiltrated with rape and molestation porn Horror isn t what your mind can fool you into believing It is what actually exists in film This is where Miike fails in Visitor Q Extremism becomes mild when it becomes a choose your own adventure
This film is a twisted nonsense of a movie set in Japan about a dysfunctional family who end up with a strange violent guest who just sits back and watches the 4 members of the family at their worst Nothing is sacred in this movie with sex drugs and violence stretched to such a limit i m surprised it got past the censors br br Overall i think it will appeal only to those whom we shouldn t be encouraging rather than any supposed underlying message coming out for the rest of us to consider A film that panders to the worst element in society and is in anyway utter gash A disappointment from a man who made the sublime Dead or Alive and Audition movies
I actually retired from Asian horror films some time ago after becoming completely sick of seeing samey ghost story rubbish However I ve been getting more and more into exploitation flicks recently and so decided to give them another chance My first port of call was highly rated director Takashi Miike s highly rated Visitor Q I d already seen Audition and while I didn t like it much I do rate it as one of the better modern Asian horror films So I went into this with sensible expectations and unfortunately found only boredom I suppose this movie is actually really clever and it just went over my head but what it seemed like to me was simply a collection of violent and nasty scenes with little or no coherency between them Any comparisons to the work of Luis Bunuel and David Lynch is blasphemous as far as I m concerned all Miike has done here is make a film any intelligence surrounding it has been implemented by pretentious fans desperate to find some kind of meaning My headache set in about 10 minutes in after a father had sex with his daughter for some reason and it didn t subside until the movie finally ended at least twenty four hours later or so it would seem Don t get me wrong I m not against violence in movies and in fact actively seek out the most notorious films around but while this may be violent it s also pointless and boring and I didn t get one ounce of enjoyment out of it Takashi Miike may have a lot of fans but I m certainly not one of them and I certainly hope this is the last time I ll come into contact with one of his films
Anyone who could find redeeming value in this piece of crap ought to have their head examined We have the submissive heroin addicted part time hooker wife with lacerations all over her body lacerations received from repeated beatings by an abusive son Now she is squirting breast milk all over the kitchen floor the release so gained somehow akin to Helen Keller placing her hands in running water We have the husband who starts out by patronizing a prostitute who just happens to be his daughter she s upset with him because he came too quickly and ends by murdering his female colleague having sex with her corpse and then chopping her up We have the kid who is relentlessly bullied by his classmates and who comes home and beats his mom You see it s all circular Deep huh The only decent moment in this horrendous pile of tripe is when the dad murders his son s tormentors It s a good thing this turkey was shot on video because otherwise what a waste of expensive film it would be If that guy who thinks artists ought to be interested in this slop is really serious no wonder most people think artists are insane We saw this lousy movie then put on Zero Woman The Accused Oh my God it was a tossup as to which one was worse What is going on in Japan these days Sick sick sick
BIG SPOILERS I ve seen one other Takashi Miike film and that was the very disturbing and brutal Audition which was an examination of the Japanese ideals of femininity In Visitor Q which I think means Visitor Question he examines in a very disturbingly gross way the family unit Miike s surreal vision of a dysfunctional family almost tries to be Lynchian in terms of confusion and film making but ultimately lacks the style and intrigue We the audience are introduced to a bizarre array of scenarios from the opening scene with the father figure Kenichi Endo who was actually quite good paying for sex with his displaced daughter Fujiko Then as the father returns home he is struck on the head by the visitor Kazushi Watanabe wielding a fairly sizeable rock and for some reason they both end up back at the family home The mother Shungiku Uchida is beaten and bullied by her son Jun Muto who is also beaten and bullied by his school peers When the visitor enters the home he somewhat menacingly establishes himself as part of the unit Eventually the family begin to improve their relationship with assistance from the visitor through milking breasts murder and retaining a sense of family pride br br And there are other crazy scenes that somehow bring the family closer together It s has uncomfortable humour but is equally frustratingly silly and over the top in its weirdness There is a necrophiliac scene that is utterly disgusting but ends up being ridiculously funny as the scene progresses Partly because of the situation itself and partly because you can t believe the filmmakers and the actors are actually doing this The style of the film is poor to say the least and the plot is stupid and unbelievably weak The characters themselves are all over the place and while I understand this is not meant to be realistic there is hardly any interest in these confronting characters and situations as all of them border on the absurd The camera work is sloppy and doesn t have that cinematic feel that Lynch s work entails It s hard to take this film seriously on a surrealist level or on an interpretation of examining the family unit in Japan It just seems that Miike was out to shock and the film seems self aware that it s trying to be shocking and it becomes almost comical to be taken seriously All in all I would say that this film is a bizarrely dark comedy but it looks and feels amateurish and seems to unnecessarily want to shock Miike s previous film Audition was finely balanced between disgusting horror character development and technique which established more intrigue in the way the film was crafted to allow the viewer to become engrossed with the plot Visitor Q is a step down as it tries too hard to be outlandishly bizarre and intentionally confronting without really having much to say in the process br br out of
I like Billy Crystal and I thought it would be fun to watch this film since I know he admired Alan King and they would be funny together I thought I had seen all Billy s movies but couldn t remember this one and now I know why It s so full of clichés and phony emotion you can smell each scene coming and going Billy doesn t even get to be funny very often He s too busy trying to cry fake tears or show his angst at how badly his father let him down Alan King himself is fairly likable as is the subplot about being an extra in the movies But what a coincidence that Billy just happens to visit his father just as a major health crisis takes place etc etc Or that two busy doctors can just shut down their practices to moon around in LA And when the end comes boy does it come quickly Almost as though the writers realized they had painted themselves into a corner and the only way out was to do a death scene Mostly disappointing with a few glimmers of good humor
Billy Crystal co wrote co produced and stars in this extremely safe and comfy comedy drama about fathers and sons adult irresponsibility and growing old Billy plays a heart surgeon who has a heart attack ha ha which causes him to seek out his estranged father Alan King a movie extra who fancies himself a big star The script is sub Neil Simon nonsense with one liners galore a flat inexpressive direction by Henry Winkler stuck in sitcom mode and family conflict at the ready Crystal and King try their best but King is over eager and frequently over the top JoBeth Williams has another one of her thankless roles but manages to bring her innate down home class to the proverbial girlfriend character It s a comedy I guess but one that blinks back the tears shamefully from
As a history nut who is particularly interested in this particular historical event I was very disappointed with the movie Granted the costumes and staging was quite authentic but the Hollywood portrayal of this British Little Big Horn was truly boring br br The amount of film footage dedicated to marching or parading troops has to have been unprecedented in film history Eveytime I heard triumphant background music begin I knew I had to prepare myself for another laborious scene of meaningless filler Obviously the producers had invested heavily into staging and were determined to get their money s worth br br Despite the outstanding cast their dialogue was again boring and their characters were never developed Whenever Peter O toole or Burt Lancaster finished a scene I would cringe with disappointment Their given lines were so weak and meaningless that I could hardly believe these were the same two great actors who portrayed Lawrence of Arabia and the Bird Man of Alcatraz respectively br br There are worse epics but this one is not much better
Bob Clampett s Porky s Poor Fish is a so so cartoon populated by appalling puns and one or two nice moments Set in Porky s Fish Shoppe Porky s Poor Fish occupies an uncomfortable area between a standard black n white Porky cartoon and one of the books come to life Merrie Melodies that were popular at that time Typically of many of the early Porky cartoons Porky is far from the star appearing only in a rather stilted opening musical number and the climax of the film For the rest of the time the star is a scraggly cat who sees the fish shop as an opportunity for a free meal but gets more than he bargained for Unfortunately the audience gets far less than they bargained for As was sometimes the case in the books come to life series the spotlight is thrown on punning signs which could have worked just as well in a non animated medium Laughs are scarce and while the cartoon is just about saved by Clampett s energetic direction there is very little at all to recommend Porky s Poor Fish over any of the other below par early Porky cartoons
Considering the risk of showing same sex relationships before the late 1980 s Personal Best could have done better to play the same sex relationship between Hemingway Chris Cahill and Donnelly Tory Skinner as a more than experimental phase of Cahill s life br br It seems to me that the creators of this movie threw in the same sex relationship between two fairly attractive women in order to attract viewers Also consider the 90 seconds of exposing the crotches of several women jumping backwards over a high jump pole This random scene had VERY LITTLE relevance to the movie and it appeared as though this was done merely to keep the audience interested in this bland movie I suppose the producers were trying to counteract the boring plot and the even more boring setting of the movie the 1980 Oregon Track and Field Competition br br This review may seem harsh but it is the truth The exploitation of young Muriel Hemingway s body and the same sex relationship ruined any credit that I would have given to this film br br Pepper Thompson
This is just typical Bruce Willis action movie schtick Watch it with some popcorn and your buddies Rent it to save money br br None of it is realistic The battles aren t realistic The soldiers aren t realistic The victims aren t realistic And why was Tom Skerritt s character talking to Willis from the DECK OF THE CARRIER What s up with that He can t do that from inside the ship br br Of course Bruce W gets a machete wound There s a bunch of average explosions br br If this movie accurately represents the Navy SEALS then don t get stuck in Africa expecting them to come rescue you br br The noble attack on the village bothered me the most Front row seats to an ethnic cleansing as Bruce looks at the slaughter going on in town So what does he do He crawls into town on his belly Yep How many died while they were putzing around Oh well a body count was needed I guess br br And if that one African guy was so important why didn t he get on the chopper with the elderly and children Can he say Duh br br Finally the movie was very dark Not just in plot but so much happens at night it was difficult to make out what was going on br br Rent it
If you like to be entertained do not go see this movie If you like to see heroics of war do not go see this movie If you like to see good acting and an excellent screenplay do not go see this movie If you like typical hollywood war films that end just in time to give a politically charged appeal to the public about the greatness and glory of war GO SEE THIS MOVIE Otherwise don t waste your time I am always interested in war movies because I think that if they are done well they can TEACH us something about the paradoxical and worthless qualities of war This film shows a bunch of guys running around the countryside saying whorrible cliche lines doing the most predictable things and defending the oppressed with the same exact force and brutality that was being given to the oppressed This film is a disgrace to filmmaking and to the United States of America Can you imagine being a person from Europe or Africa or any other country and watching this being told that this is how Americans truly are No wonder everyone hates us Please please please don t waste your time on this piece of junk if you must wait and rent it 4 10
for the Lt to have chosen this one First the film wasn t horrible it was just Hollywood Worst case I need this to happen or we have no movie scenario if Willis mission was to save the doctor but she was adamant that her people make it out of the missionary he would have put her on that first chopper and marched those refugees to the border without her He would not have compromised his package for the refugees That s not how it works But as I pointed out this is Hollywood we must have drama This is why we make movies because reality isn t quite so complicated However I did think that Willis and the good doctor had workable chemistry That said there are also some well done battle scenes in the film It s not a waste of time Tears of the Sun is worth the dvd rental fee Check it out on a rainy day and you ll be satisfied
Although a film with Bruce Willis is always worth watching you better skip this one I watched this one on television so I didn t have to plunk down cash for it Lucky me br br The plot develops slowly very slowly Although the first 30 minutes or so are quite believable it gets more and more unbelievable towards the end It is highly questionable if a seasoned soldier like Lt Waters would disobey direct orders And even if he would if the rest of his platoon would They know he puts them in direct danger and they know they will certainly die if they follow him but what the heck he is our Lt so let s do what he says despite the direct orders remember br br Still there are some nice scenes in this movie They somewhat save a village where the total population is being massacred by the rebels Well they save a dozen villagers or so the rest was already killed The strange part of it that they did take the trucks which the rebels left behind They rather go on foot Maybe because the roads are unsafe but there was no explanation for it Anyway I think this was what earned the movie the one point I gave it br br What made this movie an insult to the brain and hence completely unbelievable is that a group of 7 soldiers can kill of so many rebels without being hurt or killed themselves Only near the end they loose a few comrades And that is only because they have to fight of an army of nearly 500 or more Can you believe that br br They fight of an army of so many kill hundreds of them and only loose a few of themselves And they have rounds and round of ammo Never run out of it Grenades and claymore mines an M60 machine gun and even an RPG Where do they get this stuff Carrying it around or what They even got a laptop which shows them the activity of enemy rebels And this laptop has a battery which goes on for days Really Who think up this crap br br I guess if you turn off your brain completely and accept that the rebels are a bunch of idiots you give this movie a high rating If not skip this one It saves you time
The first ten minutes of Just Looking really dictates the direction most of this movie takes Lenny Ryan Merriman is a 14 year old boy living in New York in the 50s He has a burning desire to see two people have sex Who are the best people he has in mind Well his own mom and stepfather of course How pleasant Unfortunately for Lenny he is caught before he sees anything and is sent away for the summer to stay with his uncle and his uncle s wife br br Lenny s next plan is to see his uncle and his wife have sex However the wife is quite pregnant and they aren t currently sleeping together Then Lenny makes a new friend Him and his buddy spend most of their free time hanging around a couple of girls They have a little club where all they do is sit around and talk about sex The problem is it s not done in an innocent charming 1950 s sort of way I am no prude by ANY means but I found it rather disturbing listening to these kids talk about masturbation blowjobs and anal sex That kind of rawness may work in a movie like Kids 1995 but in this film it just seems perverted br br Gretchen Mol is utterly wasted here as Hedy a former bra model who becomes the object of Lenny s carnal desires Jason Alexander needs to stay as far away from the director s chair as possible For Better Or Worse 1996 was awful and now this What a waste 1 10
This is probably one of the worst French movies I have seen so far among more than 100 french movies I have ever seen Terrible screenplay and very medioacre unprofessional acting causes the directing powerless with all that it doesn t matter how nice western french scene and fancy music can add to the story br br One of the key weakness of this movie is that these two characters do NOT attract people as an audience I don t care what happens to them br br It amazed me how this movie won jury prize in cannes man I love almost all the awarded movies in cannes but not this one A major disappointment for me
You do realize that you ve been watching the EXACT SAME SHOW for eight years right I could understand the initial curiosity of seeing strangers co exist on an Island but you d think that after watching unkempt stink ladened heroes run roughshod through the bush with an egg on a spoon for half a decade would be enough to get you to commit to something a little more original and interesting br br And I m not even speaking of the shows validity which for the record I find questionable It s just hard to suspend disbelief for Bushy Bill eating a rat when the entire crew of producers and camera people are housed in an air conditioned make shift bio dome sipping frosty mochcinno s with moxy br br What s the appeal here I don t care about these people or their meandering lives I just don t get it But if you DO find yourself being captivated by hairy unwashed people I suggest you turn off your TV and just take a trip to your local bus station where you can see people like this in their TRUE habitat They call them HOMELESS PEOPLE and free of charge you can sit back and marvel in their uncanny ability to retrieve various cigarette debris from a plethora of garbage canisters eventually striking pay dirt and fashioning a homemade Dr Frankenstein styled cancer stick all the while begging people for change for food when the stink of Aqua Velva on their breath is enough to suggest otherwise And the best part Much like Survivor every week one member of the tribe Leaves the Island when they are unceremoniously sent packing to the local Institution when the frightening unmedicated state of full blown schizophrenia kicks into gear Now THAT S ENTERTAINMENT
How has this piece of crap stayed on TV this long It s terrible It makes me want to shoot someone It s so fake that it is actually worse than a 1940s sci fi movie I d rather have a stroke than watch this nonsense I remember watching it when it first came out I thought hey this could be interesting then I found out how absolutely insanely ridiculously stupid it really was It was so bad that I actually took out my pocket knife and stuck my hand to the table br br Please people stop watching this and all other reality shows they re the trash that is jamming the networks and canceling quality programming that requires some thought to create
This show comes up with interesting locations as fast as the travel channel It is billed as reality but in actuality it is pure prime time soap opera It s tries to use exotic locales as a facade to bring people into a phony contest then proceeds to hook viewers on the contestants soap opera style br br It also borrows from an early CBS game show pioneer Beat The Clock by inventing situations for its contestants to try overcome Then it rewards the winner money If they can spice it up with a little interaction between the characters even better While the game format is in slow motion versus Beat The Clock the real accomplishment of this series is to escape reality br br This show has elements of several types of successful past programs Reality television hardly but if your hooked on the contestants locale or contest this is your cup of tea If your not this entire series is as I say drivel dripping with gravy It is another show hiding behind the reality label which is the trend it started in 2000 br br It is slick well produced so it might last a while yet After all so do re runs of Gilligan s Island Green Acres The Beverly Hillbillies The Brady Bunch This just doesn t employ professional actors The intelligence level is about the same

I d have to say that this was a little embarrassing for the King of the Cowboys made in 1948 the picture came out a decade after Roy Rogers earliest pictures in which he had a starring role Roy s character comes off as a bit clueless in this one along with his female co star Jane Frazee who alternates her allegiance between Roy and Robert Livingston portraying chief bad guy Bill Regan The whole story seems kind of muddled with missed opportunities for what could have been an entertaining hour or so Like the legend of the Hangman s Hotel for example which says the hanged man comes to life at midnight With Andy Devine in the cast as Cookie Bullfincher you would think the story would get a little mileage out of that set up Instead you have some convoluted proceedings that would have been better served if this had been a Bowery Boys flick It was a sad attempt at a haunted hotel gimmick that relied on poor old Genevieve who truth be told wound up getting more screen time than Trigger who s contract as Smartest Horse in the Movies didn t have anything to say about getting upstaged by a mule And then you have Foy Willing and his Riders of the Purple Sage replacing Bob Nolan and the Sons of the Pioneers for your musical interlude I don t know about you but it was already half way into the picture and I was still looking for Pat Brady oh well br br Yet there was still an interesting element to be found here if you were looking hard enough and that turned out to be Roy s athletic dismount of Trigger while still on the run from the bad guys OK it was probably a stunt double but I haven t seen that one before in a couple hundred Westerns br br Jane Frazee does the honors as the female lead in this picture as she would in four other films opposite Roy in the 1947 1948 time frame In Under California Stars she appeared as Andy Devine s cousin appropriately named Caroline Bullfincher You re never quite convinced what side she ll come in on in this story though since she starts out pretending to be someone she s not and winds up on the good guy side almost by accident br br Fans of the old Laurel and Hardy films might be as surprised as I was to see James Finlayson here as the Sheriff of Sintown I would have liked a little more comedy relief written into his role but he played it pretty straight after all I had to wonder when it was all over why he and old Vanderpool Charle Coleman wound up in the mine shaft with Cookie when there was no reason for that to be Just a way to close it out I guess with about as much thought as went into the rest of the picture I hate to be that harsh but if you ve seen enough Roy Rogers flicks you ve got to know that this was not one of his finer efforts br br Say Sintown I wonder if that s the same place that grew up to be Sin City

by count out and Dibiase with the leg drop for the pin 2 1 adv Hogan s team Hogan finally allows Warrior into the match who quickly disposes of former nemesis Hercules after a splash A very predictable ending to the point of nauseous 2 10 br br Overall too many matches and too little time obviously had a detrimental effect as the wrestlers were almost waiting on a conveyor belt to be pinned Most of the heels were decimated by Warrior and Hogan which is a poor way to handle a great roster of wrestlers
This one was marred by potentially great matches being cut very short br br The opening match was a waste of the Legion of Doom but I guess the only way they could have been eliminated by Demolition was a double DQ Otherwise Mr Perfect would have had to put in overtime Kerry von Erich the I C champ was wasted here And this was the third ppv in a row where Perfect jobbed Remember before that he never lost a match br br The second match was very good possibly the best of the night Ted DiBiase and the Undertaker were excellent while the Jim Neidhart had one of his WWF highlights pinning the Honky Tonk Man Koko B Ware continued his tradition of being the first to put over a new heel remember the Big Bossman and Yokozuna This was a foreshadowing of Bret Hart s singles career as he came back from two on one and almost survived the match He and DiBiase put on a wrestling clinic making us forget that the point of the match was DiBiase s boring feud with Dusty Rhodes br br Even though the Visionaries were the first team to have all of its members survive and only the second since 87 to have four survivors this match was not a squash This was the longest match of the night and Jake did a repeat of his 88 performance when he was left alone against four men and dominated I think he could have actually pulled off an upset These days the match would have ended the other way around br br One of the shortest SS matches ever was also one of its most surprising Possibly the most underrated wrestler ever Tito Santana was the inspirational wrestler of the night putting on war paint and pinning Boris Zukhov Tanaka and even the Warlord in the final survival match It was so strange to see him put over so overwhelmingly then go right back to his mediocre career Sgt Slaughter also did well getting rid of Volkoff and the Bushwhackers but that just wasn t a surprise Tito was br br I think the only point of the survival match was to have Hogan and the Warrior win together at the end br br This show was boring and the matches were too short The Undertaker s debut was cool but Tito Santana is the reason I will remember this one
Yes Marie Dresler drinks prune juice that she thinks is poison and she exits running br br Dresler is good Never my cup of tea but she is a solid performer who surely holds the screen br br I watched this for Polly Moran whom I ve seen elsewhere Here Moran is OK just OK as Dressler s shrewish friend foe Too bad she has sunk into nearly total oblivion br br The plot is good hearted Bad guys try to rob the townspeople Dressler triumphs and all ends well br br I do wonder about the central plot mechanism bonds This came out during the Depression so maybe everyone was familiar with bonds and what they can do if used well and if used wrongly I however not of that era am vaguely familiar with them They re like stocks only different right It seems odd to build a story about The Little Man around a somewhat sophisticated monetary entity
In 1925 childhood friends Marie Dressler as Maggie Warren and Polly Moran as Lizzie Praskins oversee the wedding of their children Anita Page as Helen and Norman Foster as John Before the celebration Ms Dressler turns the reigns of her small town bank over to her son Mr Foster Six years later the Great Depression brings many bank closures and financial insecurity Banker Foster is able to survive due to mother Dressler s wise planning But Ms Moran is worried about her fortune and loudly demands a complete withdrawal Other Warren Bank customers hear Moran s rant and start questioning their own solvency Soon the family is in financial crisis br br Dressler s huge critical and financial film hit Emma had been released early in the year and MGM had to have wanted to get a new Dressler film out as soon as possible Dressler s 1931 hits Reducing and Politics were still making a lot of money and Dressler had become 1932 s US 1 Box Office Star according to the industry standard list compiled by Quigley Publications Prosperity certainly celebrated Dressler s status but the production appears uncharacteristically sloppy and rushed The cast does well considering Some more care in direction and editing and some retakes would have helped apparently they needed it in theaters for the holidays br br Prosperity 11 12 32 Sam Wood Marie Dressler Polly Moran Anita Page Norman Foster
Marie Dressler carries this Depression era drama about a kindly bank owner which recently aired on TCM during their April Fools comedy month If you come with the expectation of big laughs courtesy the Dressler Polly Moran team you ll be disappointed as this is really a very downbeat film It s also very poorly made surprisingly so considering it came from MGM Leonard Smith s bare bones cinematography is strictly from the set up the camera and don t move it school frequently to the detriment of the cast who find themselves delivering lines off screen it s like a pan and scan print before such existed or having their heads cut off The film doesn t even have a credited director underlying the apparent fly by night nature of the production Overall it s an unsatisfying mess with Dressler frequently over emoting and only that bizarre final reel dash to the bathroom to set it apart
Ugh Another one of those fooled by the cover DVDs I expected some kind of action at least with bears cats such on the cover I got NOTHING Bad movie br br I forced myself to watch this all the way through thinking that eventually SOMETHING would happen no luck br br Now the reason I gave this a 2 is because of the scenery otherwise it sucked br br The kid was terrible talking to himself although I suppose they couldn t just run a movie with dumb music and no dialogue at all doing his lame karate stances to a tree stump threatening a raccoon munching on worms and what a dumbass kicking a porcupine And he wouldn t be pulling those quills out that easily either they stick like fishhooks At least he fought the bear weakly a couple of times br br What was up with the flashback thing It made a bad movie even worse I wanted to see a survival movie not some dramatic bs about a kid suffering thru divorce br br What else can I say Well maybe they should have had the bear eat the kid or something At least that would have been more exciting br br People don t waste your time on this one
Ever wanted to eat worms Here s a documentary to show you how Yeah The kid eats live worms And that s about the most interesting part of the movie br br This movie has been pretty well summed up by previous reviewers as rather boring I m totally in agreement here The movie just doesn t go anywhere unless you re fond of worm eating This is one movie it s almost impossible to write a spoiler for because nothing much happens br br Now on the technical side They should have given that kid a haircut Who s he trying to look like anyway Bozo the Clown It was almost comical I almost expected him to turn into the shaggy dog or something br br And on top of that the kid was way too chunky to ever look hungry Should have kept him off the junk food for a couple of weeks before filming br br All in all this movie nearly put me to sleep And my kids could only handle about 15 minutes before they left the scene for something more interesting br br I will admit that the scenery was very impressive And had there been a decent story to go with it it might have made a hit br br It did seem safe enough for kids to watch The bear scenes and the oddball eyeball were too weak to frighten most kids and the brief skinny dipping scene didn t show anything br br I gave this one a very generous 3
What horrible writing and acting No personality What you can t make a good movie with a single character Hmm it was done in Castaway with self dialog br br So this kid goes on a trip to see his father The kid Jason takes a plane and the pilot has a heart attack and dies mid flight So the kid crashes in a lake and survives Then he runs around surviving in the wilderness until he gets rescued br br During that time he fights a bear twice The first time he fights it off in the lake The second time he makes a spear out of a branch and spears the bear Two shots of fake blood spurting out of the bear s chest reminded me of Monty Python s The Holy Grail br br Also the kid decides to kick a porcupine with predictable results br br Gag
In my Lit class we ve just finished the book Hatchet and this movie is nothing like the book 1 Brian never ate worms in the book 2 He didn t know the pilot s name 3 His mom was cheating on his father in a station wagon not in the woods where anyone could see 4 The man the mother is cheating with doesn t have black hair he has blonde br br Now for the unrealistic parts of the movie 1 A thirteen year old can t punch his fist through a window in one punch br br And for the acting the kid who played Brian was a horrible actor br br However I do believe that the scenery was impressive though I highly doubt the director even read the book br br This movie is good if you have not read the book Hatchet by Gary Paulsen but if you have then begin a complaint letter to the director
I came away from this movie with the feeling that it could have been so much better Instead of what should be a gripping tense story of a boy s fight for survival in the wilderness it comes off as a National Geographic documentary meets Columbia sportswear ad br br The film begins with Brian Jared Rushton preparing for a journey by plane to see his father His mother fortuitously gives him the curious choice of a hatchet as a going away gift what s wrong with a Rubik s Cube little knowing how badly he will soon need it Once in the air the plane s pilot a blink and you ll miss him cameo by Ned Beatty suffers a fatal heart attack leaving Brian helpless as the plane crashes into a lake Extremely lucky to walk or rather swim away virtually unscathed Brian must find shelter food and hope for rescue br br Here is where the main problem with the movie begins By the very nature of Brian s solitude Jared has very few lines to speak and so the film ought to have compensated by ratcheting up the tension of each scene Instead he is shown walking around sitting around and so on with only a minimal sense of danger As a result too much reliance is placed on flashbacks to the parents troubled marriage as the source of tension These scenes merely get in the way and don t particularly add much to the story Even worse occasionally Jared his face covered with mud lets out a primal scream or two which conjures up unfortunate parallels to Predator Speaking of unfortunate we could have done with being spared the sight of his mullet but it presumably helped keep him warm at night br br Another disappointment is Pamela Sue Martin in a totally ineffectual performance as the mother Both she and the father have very little impact in the movie For instance we are never shown how they react to news of Brian s disappearance how they might be organizing rescue attempts and so on This is just one source of tension the film makers would have done well to explore instead of spending so much time on events that happened before Brian embarked on his journey
This clunker of a film sets a new standard for bad filmmaking Jared Rushton gives an adequate performance of a very poorly created character in an ill fated movie thereby creating a net effect of a very bad movie The film s main thrust is how a boy s temporary excursion into the Canadian wilderness after surviving a plane crash solo allows the disgruntled adolescent to deal with his anguish over discovering his mother s extramarital affair Unfortunately it turns into a bizarre collage of random survival events including two especially hokey scenes involving fighting a bear and strange hallucinations that make you wonder if this kid isn t just sitting in an alley somewhere on pot dreaming up this whole movie and what a nightmare it is Furthermore despite the heralds of some reviewers of the family viewability of the film there are several scenes not suitable for very young children or family viewing including a graphic scene of the dead pilot underwater with one of his eyes apparently exploded br br All in all a terrible movie that nobody should be subjected to much less innocent kids
I wish I could give this movie a zero Cheesy effects and acting The only reason to see this movie is so you can see how bad it is Lets start with the kid who plays Brian What a geek I couldn t believe the mullet Then there was the talking to himself I guess they couldn t just have the movie be silent but still Of course they had to have him skinny dipping too not something I wanted to see But Jared gave a great performance compared to the special effects department Everything from the bear to the crash was something I could do myself and better I seriously doubt that Gary Paulsen had anything to do with the production seeing as the movie was not even called Hatchet Finally I do not think the writer had ever read the book seeing as nothing was the same I think the book was great but this movie stunk like a smelly goat
Bad Stuff This movie is real crap Bad stunts for one thing they looked so fake I thought this was The Twilight Zone The flashbacks are pretty much useless One part of the movie he thinks taking his anger out on a window will make his life better I wanna know the casting director and if he was high because the acting even from the adults was horrid A kissing scene in this movie even sucked This movie killed the book The book was great I highly do not recommend this movie Not even for educational purposes br br Good Stuff I don t know what I can say really There is some suspense parts that get you going but they are quickly shot down by the bad stunt work and acting br br My Verdict Do not watch
I had never read Gary Paulsen s novel Hatchet for which A Cry in the Wild is the adaptation of so I can t make any comparisons to the book I will however say that as a film on its own adaptation or no adaptation it was an underdeveloped adventure that provides no major explanation of its few characters br br Think of A Cry in the Wild as a less luxurious teenage mountaineer was Quincy California the only place this was filmed version of Cast Away Jared Rushton is 13 year old Brian Roebson a kid headed on a small plane to visit his father until the craft crashes over some deserted mountain terrain leaving the kid stranded for quite a while and having to defend himself br br There are basically three parts to the film The obvious being the ten or fifteen minute introduction of the characters namely Brian and his mom br br The next third of the movie which really consumes nearly all of the film is that of Brian roughing it These scenes contain no particularly amazing action nothing spectacular other than lots of beautiful cinematography of a beautiful Yukon landscape Nothing to put you on edge no real encounters except a brisk confrontation with a cub and no major dilemmas to initiate some sort of enjoyment or connection with the character on the screen You might even feel briefly bored with the passage of time as we witness Brian dealing with his situation through first primitive means and then more improved ones using tools etc for his survival It is more like the ordinary time that passes if you were actually stuck in the situation and that is pretty much about it In other words they put no meat on the Paulsen s words when they translated them into a visual media br br And of course the third part of the movie is his rescue br br There is a subplot that continuously seeks to make itself known during this time however Some conflict between Brian and his parents that created a rocky awkward relationship between them However for the most part it is only explained in brief intermittent minimal dialog flashbacks that look more like a back story for a music video Any minute the singer from Jefferson Starship should chime in an start singing Sara Other than what the viewer can draw from the implications or guess for his own need to fill the gaps in the narrative we get a very underdeveloped back story which was probably necessary to enjoy at least part of this film and create a connection to the characters whether or not it really had anything to do with Brian s survival adventure in the third part of the movie These are the flaws in the narrative that through the viewer into a stupor as he struggles to find out what the heck those people there on the screen are doing and for me almost done to the point of screaming at the television to say something and tell me more br br It certainly was not for me a good adventure tale But for fans of Jared Rushton it was one of the last few movies he made So watch it purely for nostalgia if nothing else
After seeing only half of the film in school back in November today I saw that it was on Flix channel and decided to watch it to see the rest of it and to write a new review on it br br The book that the film is based on Hatchet is OK This is a terrible adaption of it though br br Awful and I mean awful acting bad dialogue and average cinematography make up this terrible adaption of Hatchet br br The film starts off Brian who is the cliché image of a late 80s teen sporting a mullet banging his head to cheap 80s rock music and his mother driving in a car for him to get on a plane to fly up to see his estranged Dad his parents are divorced now cue the dramatic pause Now Brian has said goodbye to Mom and dog and is flying up to see his father The pilot is a fat ugly rude man wasn t like that in the book who after 2 minutes in the air has a heart attack and dies In the book it goes into more detail with the pilot having more pains and it seemed to be that they were in the air much longer before the pilot had his heart attack br br The plane within another two minutes has gone empty on fuel leaving us the viewers to assume that he s been up there for hours even though the sun hasn t changed position and the scenery looks EXACTLY the same Now s he s crashed landed br br This is the point in the movie where everything is a lot different then it was in the book In the book it said his jacket was torn to shreds but in the movie it is perfectly fine with no tears or rips looks like he just bought it it never said he climbed a mountain saw a wolf and fell asleep up there on the mountain it never said he was attacked by a bear it said a moose but not a bear it never said he eats the several bugs that he does it never mentions the second tornado or that he learned to get those sparrows skin them and eat them or that little fish farm trap that he makes that is destroyed by one of the tornadoes nor does it mention him hurting his ribs from one of the tornadoes br br I don t even think you can call what was depicted in the film a tornado All it was was just a windstorm that knocked down several of his things br br My favorite part of this camp fest was Brian s lame flashbacks that are never mentioned in the book especially the cliché scene of Brian waking up walking over to the window and seeing his Dad with all of his things packed that can all perfectly fit into just the back of his truck leaving and screams DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAADDDDDDDDD yet of course his father didn t hear him even though he was just right outside and he punches his fist through the window wtf br br The ending is the only thing that is close to what happened in the book I said close In the book I think one of the key things that the rescue pilot said to Brian when he landed was you re the kid who they ve been looking for They stopped months ago yet they left that line out in the movie br br There s a pathetic epilogue with Brian somehow without counseling or therapy getting back to normal with his family I think we were supposed to assume that they were getting together for Thanksgiving because they had a turkey on the counter Then it shows his temporary home for what in the movie seemed like three days but in the book was for several months and his hatchet still in a tree where he left it also didn t happen in the book showing where he carved a message so perfectly done HOME where we really supposed to believe that he carved that that perfectly with just that hatchet br br No quote can sum this movie up better then when Enid from Ghost World said this is so bad it s gone past good and back to bad again Perfect description of this movie br br I wouldn t recommend it to somebody who hasn t read the book and are just looking to watch a movie nor would I to somebody who has read the book because they ll be disappointed and bored to death br br For those who have read the book leave what your imagination created as the movie This is awful and will bring down your thoughts on the book br br 1 10
Another big star cast another glamour s set another reputed director another flick filled with songs that s topping the chart buster but alas what s missing at the day end is a story that every moviegoer expects of from such a big budget motion picture So much hype is what that was lurking around the movie before it s red carpet premiere A hype which went to an extent where Anil Kapoor envisages that the movie would be one of the finest love stories ever made after Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge Well Anilji which movie were you speaking of Well the plot of the movie is about 6 different couples and 12 different people who have a total different stance towards life but despite their different approach towards life they all have one common problem that s LOVE Well indeed a luring theme But little did we expect that the movie would be such boredom that it will let down the last expectation the audience would have from such a multistarrer movie These are kinda movies which I totally abhor because after spending a hefty buck for a multiplex ticket I get locked in the theatre for 4 hours just waiting in agony for the climax br br The trouble begins right from the start The director gets so confused with the plot that somewhere even he gets baffled as to how to share the time slot to six different star casts Some of the couples like Anil Kapoor Juhi and Sohail Khan Whoever the female is opposite to him just doesn t make any sense for their existence in the movie Salman Who calls himself rahul in a weird manner for the entire movie Well something like Rahoooooool again as usual tries to be extra cool with his Videsi kinda Hindi accent Hey Sallu Bhai now that Aish is getting married at least go get some tip from Abhishek to improve your acting abilities A simple striptease wouldn t make the movie a box office hit every time And Anilji stop shaving your trade mark beard or you look totally like a eunuch And smooching a girl of your daughters age just looks as uncool as watching Jack Nicholson in a romantic movie And please Nikhilji avoid putting such superfluous scenes in a movie that is totally not needed for the shot br br The other bigger flaw in the movie was that there wasn t any perfect synchronization between the stories of different couples Every story itself looks as if it is taken from different flicks put together to form a sadistic plot of Salaam E Ishq Bollywood still has to learn a lot from movies like Snatch Memento where the director knows the perfect art of threading the different unrelated sequences to form a perfect blended storyline br br Somewhere while I was evaluating the pre release movie reviews someone predicted that the movie wouldn t do good because the title of this movie adds up to the number 28 and 28 is considered a bad number in Numerology But I totally take my stand by saying the movie will fail not coz of its Numerology defects but because of the myriads of flaw that persisted in the movie And when director like Nikhil Advani can make such major blunders in the entire storyline of the movie any wonder wouldn t have saved the movie from bombing at the Box Office br br My suggestion for all you guys is please avoid watching this movie at any cost It isn t worth a pie that you pay for the ticket There indeed are better movies on theater screens currently which are worth watching more than Salaam E Ishq
I was so excited and hyped up about watching this film when the promos first came out in November It looked awesome and the songs I was quite disappointed when I went to watch it This is a film which weaves 6 couples together It has a multi cast of 12 people A huge amount of stars have worked on this film I think the director Nikhil Advani has not managed the situation well and should not have had many people in this movie as this would of made it easier for him Compared to Nikhil s directorial Debut Kal Ho Naa Ho Salaam e Ishq falls quite behind I think Nikhil should have a smaller star cast I think the best factors of this film is the songs The songs are excellent and I think that all of the songs are awesome Shankar Ehsaan Loy done an excellent job and have done an excellent jobs over the years I think the ratings of this movie may go up because of the excellent songs One thing I was disappointed with is that the director should not have included nudity in this film which is done by Sohail Khan and Isha Koppikar I found this extremely rude watching this with family Although some may find this nude as comedy it is not something you would want to watch with parents I think the best acting was performed by Salman and Priyanka Overall I think its an alright movie
I have been waiting for this movie a long time Especially because Juhi Chawla is in this she s a great actress br br This movie contains six stories It s a new concept flew over from Hollywood So it s not a new item br br 1 Khamini priyanka chopra is a dancer She wants to get famous and makes up a boyfriend to let news reporters be interested in her But then Rahul Salman Khan appears and he claims to be her boyfriend br br Priyanka Chopra is still not a good actress When she yells I get annoyed Salman khan cannot play comic roles But in his serious parts he is marvelous br br 2 Vinay Anil Kapoor is married to Seema Juhi Chawla He gets in a midlife crisis and gets attracted to a much younger woman with forgetting what he really has in life his wife and kids br br Anil kapoor en Juhi are natural born actors actresses They are great But this story is to thin for them br br 3 Shiven Akshaye Khanna is going to get married to Gia Ayesha Takia but he gets cold feet and blows the wedding off br br 4 Ashutosh Joh Abraham is married to Tehzeeb Vidya Balan She gets an accident and suffers a memory loss Now she doesn t know that she loves her husband anymore br br 5 Raju Govinda is a cab driver He meets Stephani Shannon Esrechowitz who is a white woman who is in love with an Indian male but he is about to get married with an Indian woman Raju has to bring Staphani to that man but falls in love with her br br I never liked Govinda s movies He is very annoying not funny But in this movie I liked him very much like he has been growing up the last years br br 6 Oh yes There is Sohail Khan He plays Ram Dayal who is just married to Phoolwati Isha Koppikar He want to get some serious action with her but every time her family comes in between br br Sohail Khan is not a handsome actor but he is funny I like his movies br br Now here s the problem All these stories aren t interesting To make one story from six not interesting stories does not make the whole movie interesting Here and there the stories touch each other but is not significant for the characters br br My conclusion Priyanka cannot act Loose that woman in the bollywood industry Sohail Khan should make more movies this role for him was too small Salman Khan cannot act comic roles but real serious movies That s written on his life as an actor This movie sucks and is a waste of a cast of good actors and actresses like Anil Kapoor Juhi Chawla Akshaya Khanna and John Abraham br br It s just like you have the ability to make a movie with Amitabh Bachchan and you only let him sing a lullaby
this movie has lot of downsides and thats all i could see it is painfully long and awfully directed i could see whole audience getting impatient and waiting for it to end run time is way over 3 hrs which could have been edited to less then 2 hrs br br transition between stories is average most people confessed being on seating expecting something better to come out br br its funny only in pockets ambitious project and a below par execution govinda does a fair job anil kapoor disappointed me rest we as expected if u r expecting anything close to babel or love actually then its no where close
this is a terrible terrible film br br first of all TOOO long the longest movie i have ever seen br br the stories are all too Damn Over the Top br br as a matter of fact there are too many stories that the Story line is Ruined br br the comedy wasn t Comedy it wasn t funny at all br br the story is so repulsive and badly written that it doesnot matter if the characters live or die br br i had some expectations from this movie but my expectations were crashed completely in the first few minutes br br the only thing good about this movie is the MUSIC and obviously Vidya Balan she gives the best performance and stands out among all the senior actors she s just a new comer and yet she shines and makes the rest of the cast look so Pathetic Govinda and the Blonde who playes his love interest also help saving this Disastrous movie Govinda perfectly fits in the role of the Taxi driver and the Blonde also gives a very subtle and consistent performance br br another Talented actress Ayesha Takiya is completely wasted in this movie so is priyanka Akshay does his role well but it seemed too over the top Anil and Juhi are also totally wasted br br the only one not wasted is Salman Because he has No Talent what so ever to be wasted br br all in all this is a very Impossible movie with Mishmashed screenplay and TOOO Masladar that the storyline is shaped according to the stupid comedy scenes imagine how stupid this movie is br br 3 10 it is four hours long think and RETHINK before going to the cinemas better Avoid it
Six for the price of one So it is a bonanza time for Cinegoers Isn t it Here it is not one not two but all SIX love stories an ensemble cast of top stars of bollywood plus all stories in the genre of your favorite top directors Johar Bhansali Chopra et al You will get to see every damn type of love story that you enjoyed or rather tolerated for years now So no big deal for you Do you need anything more than this No sir thank you Why sir Enough is enough Please spare us They signed every top star that they manage to sign whether required or not so they end up making a circus of stars believe it or not Too crowded Every thing depicted here is exactly how it is prescribed in bollywood textbook of romances Plus you have to justify the length given to each story as each has stars Therefore it is too long three hours plus The gags are filmy Characters are filmy Problems Barriers situations resolution yes you guessed it right again filmy tried and tested Same hundreds of dancers dancing in colorful costumes in background Why they have no other work to do All couples are sugary sweet fairy tale type Picture perfect All are good looking Each story beginning in a perfect way and therefore should ends also in that impossible perfect manner Too haphazard You can t connect to a single story Here you have everything that you already seen a million times Bloody fake unreal escapist abnormal stories considered normal for more than hundred years since evolution of this Indian cinema What a mockery of sensibilities of today s audience Yes it could have worked as a parody if he just paid tribute to love stories of yesteryear but alas even that thing is not explored At least Director Nikhil Advani should have attempted one unconventional offbeat love story but then what will happen to the tradition of living up to the mark of commercial bollwood potboiler brigade Oh Somebody has to carry on no Imagine on one hand audience finds it difficult to sit through one such love story and here we have six times the pain I mean six damn stories I mean double the fun of chopra s Mohabbatein Year 2000 In this age and time get something real guys We are now desperate to see some not so colorful people and not so bright stories Oh What have you said just now come on that is entertainment My advice please don t waste your time henceforth reading such reviews Go instead have some more such entertainment Thank you
The only possible way to enjoy this flick is to bang your head against the wall allow some internal hemorrhaging of the brain let a bunch of your brain cells die and once you are officially mentally retarded perhaps then you MIGHT enjoy this film br br The only saving grace was the story between Raju and Stephanie Govinda was excellent in the role of the cab driver and so was the Brit girl Perhaps if they would have created the whole movie on their escapades in India and how they eventually fall in love would have made it a much more enjoyable film br br The only reason I gave it a 3 rating is because of Govida and his ability as an actor when it comes to comedy br br Juhi Chawla and Anil Kapoor were wasted needlessly Plus the scene at Heathrow of the re union was just too much to digest Being an international traveler in the post 9 11 world Anil Kapoor would have got himself shot much before he even reached the sky bridge to profess his true love But then again the point of the movie was to defy logic gravity physics and throw an egg on the face of the GENERAL audience br br Watch it at your own peril At least I know I have been scarred for life
My sincere advice to all don t watch the movie br br Don t even go near to the theater where this movie is being played even a glimpse of it is bad for health serious no jokes it s 3 30 am in the morning and i returned from this crappiest movie on this universe FOUR HOURS DAMN I am proud that i survived after all of it If this is called survival br br i am highly frustrated annoyed disappointed it was sheer waste of time money went in drain no plot Hope i wake up tomorrow sane and with no memories of this night RUBBISH MOVIE br br Happy Republic day to one and all
This is a sad film made for sad people I was sitting in theaters tearing my hair apart wanting to break the chairs in front of me as the movie spitted out one cringe inducing scenes after another And there were people roaring with laughter behind me which made me wonder what kind of films these people must be watching to actually enjoy this horse s t br br Nikkhil Advani has six stories with no plot and no interesting characters The screenplay is dull probably he was drunk when he was writing this film There is no strong hold on any of these stories Nothing new nothing to hold the audience and filled with dialogs which you would have heard a million times before One of the stories is about this couple not being able to have sex because of series of disasters taking place every time they want to do it I mean seriously is this story really required Its not funny not creative but only proves that Advani has no sense of comedy Another of the stories which was probably the only story I was interested in is based on a man s infidelity and that too ends in a lame age old sati savitri pati parmeshwar crap I have no idea what the Salmaan Priyanka plot was all about There was no issue in the plot for it to be a plot She can t take Karan Johar s film because she has to marry Salmaan Why can t she marry him and still take the film or does Advani and Priyanaka just want to prove the world that it is in fact true that female actors cant be successful if they are married or that they should not act in films once they are married With six actors in the film obviously Advani cant produce the film all by himself So he makes full use of sponsors like the Times group shamelessly promoting their Filmfare magazines And also some jewelery brand which the women in the film absolutely seem to adore I come to IMDb to give it the worst rating and i am shocked to see posts praising the film It just goes to show the sad state of bollywood and how star struck the fans are With fans like these movies like Salaam E Ishq will be continue to be made and worse probably be a hit
Six different couples Six different love stories Six different love angles Eighty numbers of audience in the movie theater Looking at the eighty different parts of the silver screen br br I am sitting in somewhere between them looking at the center of the screen to find out what s going on in the movie All stories have got no link with each other but somewhere down the line Nikhil Advani trying to show some relation between them I tried to find out a few lines I could write as review but at the end of 3 hours 15 minutes found nothing to write The movie is a poor copy of Hollywood blockbuster LOVE ACTUALLY br br My suggestion Don t watch the movie if you really want to watch a nice movie
Clocking in at an interminable three hours and twenty minutes Salaam e Ishq is a pretty but superficial comic soap opera from India that regales us with six interwoven tales of romantic love which is at least four tales too many in my estimation br br Filmed like a cross between an MTV music video and a Super Bowl beer commercial the movie is a sprawling mishmash of exotic settings dazzling colors sexy showgirls high stepping song and dance numbers dream and fantasy sequences winking character asides corny dialogue and way over the top comical performances all pretty much standard issue stuff when it comes to Bollywood happenings these days It s an exhausting chore just trying to keep all the characters straight as they dance prance and preen their way through the incomprehensible storyline br br There s plenty for the viewer to feast his eyes on here not least of all all the drop dead gorgeous women but he ll need the patience of Job to get him all the way through it
We all have seen some unending epics in our times but this one really tops them all The movie is so long and so slow that just to put things in perspective i felt a lot older when i left movie hall than I entered it At almost 4 hours length it could have rather been made into a tele serial br br What starts as a promising comedy slowly loses its pace Nikhil advani has woven the plot around 6 love stories and he cant make justice to any one of them There is no interconnection between them to start with and links shown in last 20 minutes just seem to be forced to connect the story br br Situation is made worse by Silly dialogues most of them repeated in Hindi cinema over years and stupid cinematography br br Priyanka doesn t realise that she actually needs to play her role rather than just looking glam on screen An utter waste of beauty without acting skills br br And then there is loud is humorous Govinda my face twists better than jim carrey Akshay Khanna who keep belching at the top of their lungs to irritate already tired viewers br br Only good part in movie is John Vidya s love story nice acting comedy by sohail Isha But they are so good at their roles that just these two couples could have justified the movie without jumbling it with other bunch of characters Their brilliance gets lost in the midst of other substandard plot lines br br My guess Director was making two separate movies may be more and some beginner assistant mixed up all the records beyond a point of sorting them out so director was left with no choice to show it all as a single movie br br Watch it only if you want to test your patience
OK the director remakes LOVE ACTUALLY The director Nikhil Advani after debuting with KHNH does his second half and wait br br He makes a 3 30 hours film which loses on patience time etc The viewer seems like a 3 hrs sleep watching this film br br OK they had 6 stories so it was necessary but why 6 stories br br We have the Anil Juhi story convincing but boring don t TV serials show such stories br br We have Govinda Shannon story which is funny and works well br br We have Akshaye Ayesha story again believable but gets boring soon and the focus is on comedy more and that too slapstick boring comedy br br We have Salman Priyanka story which is the worst not just acting terms it makes no sense at all br br We have Sohail Isha story to make you laugh and the trick works at times thanks to the boredom set by most of other stories br br We have John Vidya story a good story in all respects br br But then by the time all stories come in bits n pieces the viewer gets bored and sleepy The climax isn t appealing though especially The climax of Salman Priyanka story Nikhil Advani s handling is alright at places some stories are well handled but weak at places Music SEL is good but too many songs Cinematography is nice every story is given a different look texture and it works br br Actors Govinda rocks after a dismissal comeback with BB he actually makes you laugh and love him in this film despite his age and weight Anil Kapoor acts his part well though he looks out of shape and tired John excels in his part Akshaye Khanna overacts for a change br br Sohail Khan is too over the top and Isha has nothing to do Anjana Suknani is dismissal br br Priyanka and Salman deserve an award for this film you are shocked br br Salman Khan doesn t act only just talks like he is in his sleep and that fake accent oh god Priyanka overacts to such a standard you feel like throwing something on her she does get better towards the end Vidya Balan is good Juhi Chawla is okay Shannon is okay
It s amazing to see how Nikhil Advani manages to attract people to the theater till the very day of the release I mean look at the cast here the promotion is superb good enough songs and the trailers are fine This makes it a house full on the first day but it s only when people go and see the film they realize that there is no way their money is refundable House full the first day the movie is out the next week br br This film inspired by Love Actually is what they say didn t manage to handle the whole cast well They tried to put in big stars but ended up by not even managing to bring out even an average performance by any one The stories are hollow and cheesy so the audience can t connect with any single one of them It s a big disappointment to all those who like big stars or for that matter Nikhil Advani after his big success of Kal Ho Na Ho
The problems with Nikhil Advani s Salaam e Ishq are many A one line concept that looks good on paper which also worked in an earlier English film Love Actually goes terribly wrong thanks to inept and shallow writing A well intentioned idea gets crushed to smithereens under the weight of its own gargantuan ambition A director so completely besotted by his own much applauded first film goes overboard with the devices that worked in his earlier film Kal Ho Na Ho try counting the number of times the device of split screens is used in this flick The problem is what worked fabulously in Kal Ho Na Ho were the emotional excesses of the Karan Johar school of film making but here emotion doesn t quite grace us with its appearance on the screen no not even cursorily The writer director gives us six relationships with one common problem love but where is the intensity where is the depth where is the emotion A tribute to love sans emotion And one that goes on and on and on Nah it just cannot work br br In my opinion the basic requirement for a portmanteau film like this to work is that not only should each individual story be complete it should in some way or the other follow the graph of the traditional three act structure screen writing guru Syd Field s Paradigm That s the real reason why Salaam e Ishq didn t work for me None of the stories had any depth or a roller coaster ride of emotional ups and downs one expects in mainstream Hindi cinema Also the linkage between some of the stories seemed tenuous and very forced It s not clear what Salman Khan is doing at Ayesha Takia s wedding If he was required to be present at the wedding scene for a neat wrap up why not conjure a few more coincidences and bring the other two couples also to the wedding That would be neater br br But yes some of the stories did have a lot of promise For one the Anil Kapoor Juhee Chawla story tries to address a very real situation mid life crisis but its journey is so linear that you re left wondering if it was really an issue Similarly the problem of commitment in the Akshaye Khanna Ayesha Takia story is also true to life If only it was developed a little better I felt that the more promising stories in this mish mash were told from the male point of view which is fine but it brings down the emotional quotient of these stories because the female characters Juhee Chawla and Ayesh Takia in particular have all the depth of a half filled bath tub Wasn t this film supposed to be about 12 different lives Now the actors John Abraham still needs to learn acting while Vidya Balan is dependable and endearing as ever Anil Kapoor gets a role written just for him but sometimes overplay the boredom of his character Since she didn t get a meaty character to portray Juhee Chawla uses her charming smile and natural acting style to cover up for it Akshaye Khanna is fine despite going a trifle over the top in a few scenes Ayesha Takia has nothing much to do but she does remind us that she s the same girl who surprised us with her bravura performance in Dor Govinda tries to make up for that HUGE mistake called Bhagam Bhag and succeeds to a large extent br br That brings me the most irritating track of the film which unpardonably ends up hogging the maximum screen time Salman Khan and Priyanka Chopra The track is irritating mainly because of them But I must credit them for their consistency They re consistently BAD all through the film Priyanka could well be the next queen of hamming I don t buy the crap that her role that of an item girl required her to act over the top Somebody should tell her the difference between being flamboyant because the character demands it and downright hamming If you ve seen Rakhi Sawant who seems to be the inspiration behind this role in her interviews and Bigg Boss you ll know what I mean I strongly feel that if Nikhil Advani had taken Rakhi Sawant in this role rather than a bigger star like Priyanka the story would have worked better Salman Khan s phony accent is well Shannon Esra s Hindi is less accented than Salman s br br To be fair to the director he does manage to add some good directorial touches to the film I particularly liked the use of grey as the predominant color in the Anil Kapoor Juhee Chawla story as a metaphor for their boring existence and the bright colors that come into the story with the arrival of the other woman But will anyone choose to paint their house in varying depressing shades of grey That s acceptable cinematic license I would say But when the film runs almost for 4 hours it almost feels like the director is trying too hard to give the audience a glimpse of his touch in an endlessly meandering montage of uninspiring sequences br br Maybe Nikhil Advani wants us to sit in the theatre for as long as is humanly possible pata nahin kal ho na ho
I had a video of the thing And I think it was my fourth attempt that I managed to watch the whole film without drifting off to sleep It s slow moving and the idea of a mid Atlantic platform which may have been revolutionary at the time is now just a great big yawnaroony Apart from Conrad Veidt the rest of the cast are pretty forgettable and it is only in the action towards the end that things get really interesting When the water started to spill big time it even on one occasion woke me up br br But give the man his due No one could hold a cigarette like Conrad Veidt He doesn t wedge it between his index and middle fingers like the lesser mortals He holds it in his fingers while showing us the old pearly browns There are a few scenes in this film where the smoke drifts up to heaven against a dark background and looks very artistically done But it does not say much about this film if all that impresses you is the tobacco smoke

John Pressman Micheal I shoulda called Ditech Lerner works at a doctor s office as an orderly His mother Zelda Poltergeist Rubenstein hypnotizes him to off the people who see thinks wronged him But this turns out to be a movie within a movie but the lines soon blur as John goes a movie theater to kill Prompting a guy who s watching the movie to do the same Lerner is suitably over the top in this but Zelda repeats lines of dialog over and over again That gets annoying fast But not as annoying as the two girls who are watching the movie within a movie As a horror film this one fails it s too busy trying to be clever trying to impart a message and seems to forget a slasher film must evoke a sense of tension or at least a jump or two No what we have here is the worst kind of slasher An art house one br br My Grade D
The dialogue was pretty dreadful The plot not really all that inspired beyond the obvious twist it presents Not visually stunning Actually visually annoying at times Most definitely one of those films you find easier to finish if you keep one finger on the fast forward button If you could watch it for free have absolutely no other options open at the moment and you really dig seeing the little poltergeist lady well maybe I d recommend it to you but not anyone else I could think of at the moment
I should have figured that any movie with the Poltergeist lady in it isn t going to be good It actually starts out okay but during the first murder scene you find out that the movie you re watching is a movie inside of a movie There s people sitting in a movie theatre watching that movie One girl in the audience is so annoying that I would have turned around and strangled her A bit strange but far from good
A somewhat awkward spy mystery with a predictable plot about World War Two dangers The mystery is whether or not Jane Graystone Nancy Coleman has amnesia The best acting is done by Raymond Massey as Dr Ingersoll a good doctor turned evil He is head of a spy ring attempting to get information from amnesiac Jane coded information related to allied activities Will she tell Can she remember Moroni Olson as Mr Goodwin is convincing as an accomplice to Massey The role played by John Garfield as Dr Lewis is nothing short of disastrous He seems so badly miscast that the casting has to be ranked as one of the worst in film history It is unfortunate that so talented an actor is stuffed into a role which not befitting his talents The movie is worth one look despite being a half spy and half gangster film and despite containing a parade of stereotyped characters It s easy to forget this one amnesia is not necessary
Alfred Hitchcok is not my favorite director by any means but imagine what he could have done with this The plot holds much potential for suspense John Garfield is as almost always excellent and Raymond Massey is scarily cast against type Nancy Coleman is not a very impressive leading lady but the supporting cast is large and very capable br br Yes it starts to sag fairly early There are too many coincidences And an important subject is trivialized by its being made into little more in the end than a love story br br It s fun to watch for Garfield Massey and the character performers But it s not awfully good
If Bob Ludlum was to see this mini series he would have cried This was complete waste of time and money I have read the book and even though movies are not exactly what the book may be CBS wasted time and money on this and it is embarrassing to claim that this was Ludlum s work br br May be the creator should check out the Bourne Identity with Richard Chamberlain and see how good that TV series was br br Poor Mira Blair Anjelica and Colm why did they sign to stoop this low br br Horrible
I am a big fan of Ludlum s work and of the Covert one books and I had often thought how incredible they would be made into a film Imagine my excitement then on learning that such a movie actually existed The Hades Factor being the first in the series seemed an obvious place to start br br From the outset the film was disappointing Simple elements from the film such as Griffin s first meeting with Smith are needlessly different from the book and much less exhilarating Several characters are poorly cast too For starters Dorff is woeful as Smith Not a bad actor just an incredibly bad choice as he is far too soft and fails to exhibit many of the features that are definitive of John Smith br br Re naming re assignment and even omission of certain characters further degrades this film For example the removal of Victor Tremont and the entire back story of the virus including the involvement of VAXHAM makes the entire point to the film somewhat hazy Marty Zellerbach is a very large part of the book and in the seat he takes vary much a back seat not to mention that the film character shares nothing in common with the character in the book is another big mistake br br Rachel Russel is presumably supposed to be Randi Russel from the book Not only is she supposed to be the sister of Sophie Amsden should be called Sophia Russel but she is also supposed to work from the CIA NOT Covert one Which brings me to my final point and I think one of the most important COVERT ONE doesn t even exist at this point Not until the second book of the series is Covert One devised by the president as a preventative measure against further biological terrorism br br To be honest I could go on all day In short if you like the books and want to see a good adaptation I m afraid you ll be bitterly disappointed Even as an action movie it is thoroughly average mainly due to very lack luster editing and poor effects The bumbled story line and dull as ditch water script are the final nails in the very cheap coffin of this film
A small time hood tricks the local mob boss out of a lot of money Of course the mob boss wants his money back and doesn t care who he has to kill to get it The punk enlists his friend and an old mobster to help him save his life br br If this sounds ridiculous it is The whole idea that this Izod wearing dune buggy driving punk could hold off one of the most powerful mobs in Rome is just plain silly His friend may be good with a gun but he s up against a group of trained killers The old mobster is little more than comic relief and no real help when it comes to the face off with the mob There s also a sub plot about how the friend s father was killed years ago by the mob boss but there s little made of it and it doesn t help the movie any at all br br The mob boss Mister Scarface is played by Jack Palance I suppose he got the name because he has what looks like a shaving nick on his cheek Palance is as ineffective as the rest of the cast doing what he must to get a paycheck br br I ve seen some pretty good Italian crime cop flicks recently but Mister Scarface isn t one of them Check out Syndicate Sadists or Revolver instead
I read a couple of good reviews on this board for Mr Scarface but for anyone uninitiated in the genre of Italian gangster films like myself the picture will probably make very little sense Indeed after the initial setup involving the ten million lira scam the picture devolved into a fairly routine revenge flick with a minor twist in the identity of Rick s Al Cliver character The whole gang war plot got muddied up for me with the inclusion of Vinchenzo Napoli Vittorio Caprioli but as most other viewers commented he s about the only one who gave this picture any life with his often ineffective attempts at violence I found it somewhat unbelievable that Manzari s goons who chased Tony through the streets didn t actually stroke out before Tony even laid a hand on them For all of his buildup as the title character Jack Palance was wasted rather unceremoniously in an anticlimactic near finale making the U S working title Mr Scarface rather moot I ve seen enough spaghetti Westerns to know that they don t all work I guess in this case my first look at a spaghetti gangster flick didn t quite make it either
This was such a waste of time Danger If you watch it you will be tempted to tear your DVD out of the wall and heave it thru the window br br An amateur production terrible repetitive vacuous dialog paper thin plot line wooden performances Lucy Lawless was pathetically hackneyed br br Seriously flawed story completely unbelievable characters The two worst concepts in film and t v are 1 the evil twin 2 amnesia There are no twins br br The plot twist Outrageously simplistic and obvious like watching a train coming down the track in the middle of the day on the prairies It doesn t even resolve properly The evil is not punished for the original crime br br Please please please don t watch this even if its free and your only other choice is to go to a synagogue
That might be a bit harsh for me saying that but sadly so far in his directing career its true Just have a look at what he as done so far They barely make it past the 3 star mark br br Why did I watch this movie 2 reasons Lucy Lawless and Heroes star Greg Grunberg Lucy was outstanding in this movie her performance carries the whole movie I do hope she gets a blockbuster and breaks into the bigger league of actors she clearly has the skills Greg was not so impressive typical TV acting style br br The movie is oddly categorized as a horror The only horror is short flashbacks and they last a max of 2 5 seconds with a little blood in them I personally would call this more a drama thriller br br But no matter how interesting the story actually is bad directing editing and acting appart from Lucy destroys it You get no real connection to the actors something which is very important in a story like this one You just sit there watching feeling nothing Its like watching a bad TV soap actually I think the TV soap would be more interesting br br My advice Stay away from this movie or better yet just stay away from anything Michael Hurst is involved with
The story idea is excellent Unfortunately the execution lets it down br br The movie lacks pace for one thing It should be an exciting ride but it is slow and more than a little boring br br I think the problem s mainly in the screenplay and editing There aren t enough obstacles and reversals to ratchet up suspense and there are scenes which don t really move the story along very effectively br br The producers should have seen this in the screenplay and insisted upon a major rewrite Unfortunately when the producer is also the writer and the director this evidently ain t gonna happen br br Much of the acting seems kind of flat and that is down to the director all the actors have been quite competent in other projects br br It s a shame because with better writing editing and direction this could have been a really good thriller
Reed Diamond plays a man suffering from amnesia who s been in a mental asylum for over a decade after he was found wondering the back roads with blood on his hands The doctors want to test out an experimental new drug that ll return his lost memories if it works But when the drugs give him hallucinations of a demon he chooses to escape instead While outside he befriends a young boy whose stepfather Greg Grunberg mistreats his mother won t let her near the darkroom in his basement acts suspicious in general br br While the general mystery of the film is a tad easy to identify way before it s revealed I found Mr Diamond s acting to be enthralling enough to keep my attention throughout In the interest of full disclosure I ve been a huge fan of his since Homicide and his brief but extremely pivotal role in The Shield up through Journeyman Dollhouse Not a great film nor a good one but serviceable enough Although I did like it better than the previous films that I ve seen from Director writer Michael Hurst Room 6 Pumkinhead 4 Mansquito br br Eye Candy one fleeting pair of boobs in a hallucination br br My Grade C
Quite the most boring nonsense I have seen in a long time The plot was full of irrelevance and the acting was the worst I have seen in a long time br br To make it worse camera angles that made me feel sick were used the incidental music was terrible and drowned out the dialogue maybe not a bad thing then and the shots of San Francisco looked as if they had been stolen straight out of the city tourist board s promotional video br br Oh and the obligatory sex scene was not even half well done Better lighting next time please
This movie was on the Romance channel and I thought it might be a goofy 80 s movie that would be enjoyable on some level so my brother and I watched it Boy did it suck Boy gets crush on girl correction his dream girl apparently there is a difference and I m surprised he realized she was his dream girl he was smitten with her from over 30 feet away I guess that just goes to show the power of dream girls boy ends up masquerading as a female to be near dream girl creative in the sense that it s a far out plan but un creative in the sense that there are probably better solutions one might think up awkward situations ensue a match is made all of which takes seems to take place around late afternoon either the location was somehow responsible for this odd lighting or the actors had to wait until they got off of their day jobs to come to the set I suspect the latter Very clumsily done very pathetic It s almost never even amusing accidentally so there really is nothing to redeem it Unless you re interested in seeing Chad Lowe s early days before he finally got his piece of the pie with his role as the HIV positive gay guy on the series Life Goes On or Gail O Grady who was on NYPD Blue and probably got to stare at Dennis Franz s buttocks But those are unlikely motives I d say systematic derangement of the senses would be a more justified purpose I m surprised I watched it all I guess it s the kind of thing where halfway through you find yourself still watching due to some morbid self flagellistic inner issue and think you might as well finish it so you can tell your friends and family that you actually sat through such a horrible movie on the off chance that it ll garner you some sympathy for the questionable state of your mental health Can You Take the Challenge
I really wish that when making a comedy the people actually tried to make it funny This is a film that you can sit through but nothing is special about it After watching it you will say that it was alright It was not boring to watch but gave the audience no jokes to laugh at Entertainment should mean that you actually get something more than an o k story This movie wanted to be Tootsie but instead it failed br br I gave it a 1 out of 10
I saw this movie in the middle of the night when I was flipping through the channels and there was nothing else on to watch It s one of those films where you stop to see what it is just for a moment but realize after twenty minutes or so that you just can t turn it off no matter how bad it is One of those movies that is somewhere in between being so bad it s good and so bad it s well just plain BAD it s worth seeing just to experience the confusion of realizing that it s both Great middle of the night fare if only for the fabulous tennis drag Don t even bother asking yourself why nobody can tell that Chad Lowe is so obviously male because logic does not apply
I concur with everyone above who said anything that will convince you to not waste even a briefest of moments watching this amazingly amateurish movie Very poor acting offhand production values utterly pedestrian direction and a script so inept and inane it should never have been written let alone produced Even Hollywood professionals apparently go to work just for a paycheck although no one should have been paid for this bad work Careers should instead have ENDED over this inconsequential drivel br br OTH there is something fascinating about watching something so jaw droppingly bad And Chad Lowe is terrifically and consistently bad
Generally I ve found that if you don t hear about a movie prior to seeing it on DVD there s probably a good reason for it I hadn t heard about this movie at all until I was in a Blockbuster the other day and saw it on a shelf Since all the good movies had already been rented out the ones I wanted to see anyway I figured I d give this one a shot br br It s really not much different than other movies in the genre such as The Singles Ward or the R M If you re into those type movies you ll probably enjoy this br br However if you re not a mormon this movie probably won t appeal to you There s no way to avoid the overtly religious mormon message contained within and at times it comes across as sappy and cheesy Ultimately if you don t fall within the mormon demographic you re probably better off watching something else br br Admittedly there were some very funny moments in the film but I didn t think that it was enough to salvage the movie overall
Baptists at Our Barbecue is the best film ever made Now that I got your attention with that horribly inaccurate statement that should be a hanging offense if spoken let me begin my short overview of this tacky offensive pretentious and boring hunk of junk I guess you could consider a movie First of all the low budget of this stinker is totally obvious based on the very poor and inexperienced direction of Christian Vuissa and the tacky overly preachy whiny and stilted screenplay by F Mathew Smith I really despise the fact that it sends a very pro Mormon and sort of anti every other religion message Yes the story is about a small town half full with Mormons and half full with Baptists It shows all the main and role model characters being Mormon and being so nice and perfect yet they are being picked on by the evil conniving and very judgmental Baptists It shows how beautiful Mormons are and how cold hearted and ignorant Baptists are instead of showing a little solidarity like would be appropriate and realistic I m a part of neither religion I m actually an atheist but this offended me along with another countless amount of Baptists most likely It shows the Baptists as being very unopened and unwelcoming to the Mormons and the Mormons being very accepting when again in reality there is a mutual like dislike between them Sorry I didn t mean to go off on a rant br br Another aspect of Baptists at Our Barbecue I didn t much care for was the acting The performances are very amateurish and unnatural especially from the female lead Heather Beers Miss Beers stumbles her way through her part without any passion or feeling for her role and I wasn t too much impressed with Dan Merkley who s the main character in this lackluster of a motion picture but I have to say he s way more talented or shows more talent in this film then Heather Beers Whoever played the town sheriff was awful also Although there is maybe a tiny laugh deep within the film it is full of clichés For example the main character Tartan Merkley finds solace with a Native American who always gives him the best advice on things relating to a tribal way of life how cliché is that To make the situation even more of a pathetic cliché Tartan buys the poor lonely heathen a puppy dog Ugghhh br br If you want my advice stay as far away from Baptists at Our Barbecue as you can I saw it on the shelf and thought it would be a cute and interesting little indie about religion All I got was a well piece of crap Grade D br br my ratings guide A absolutley flawless A a masterpiece near perfect A excellent B great B very good B good C a mixed bag C average C disappointing D bad D very bad D absolutley horrendous F not one redeeming quality in this hunk of Hollywood feces
First of all this movie is not a comedy unless you really force yourself you can hardly laugh Secondly the movie is slow and boring The acting is not bad but not special There is a Lucky Luke comic about two families one with big noses and one with big ears fighting each other in a small town you will laugh much more if you read this instead of wasting your time with this movie Religions and dogmas are not the best source to make a good comedy and this movie does nothing more than confirm this rule There is a similar subject comedy The home teachers this had some good moments My final comment is do not waste your time and money to watch this uninspired and boring film
This movie was awful I had a very difficult time watching this all the way through I didn t get the point of the movie What was the point of this movie The soundtrack was bad acting was bad and the story uninspiring The two main characters in the movie were very boring and their dialog was uninteresting There was no chemistry among any of the cast members I don t know this for a fact but I suspect that most of the actors were first timers The movie could have easily been cut down to about an hour and half without losing the plot That indicates how many useless scenes there were in the movie I would have rather ha a root canal during the two hours of the movie I want those two hours back If you want to watch good funny movie that is family friendly and made by a bunch of mormons watch Napoleon Dynamite instead
Movie about a small town with equal numbers of Mormons and Baptists New family moves in cue the overwritten dialog mediocre acting green jello salad with shredded carrots and every other inside Mormon joke known to man Anyone outside the Mormon culture will have a hard time stomaching this movie Anyone inside the Mormon culture will be slightly amused with a chuckle here and there You ll be much better off watching Hess s other movies Napoleon Dynamite etc than trying to sit through this one The acting is mediocre Jared Hess has had his hands on much more quality films like Saints and Soldiers and Napoleon Dynamite I would recommend both movies over this groaner
The story of the film was as simple minded as its morality Go find a girl marry her live with her happily ever after Though the film had some fine moments and turns most of it stayed at the surface of what might have been shown in a film with the same storyline br br The Baptist Mormon struggle was only touched superficially and was mocked about probably intentionally A more interesting story would have been a mixed couple br br If you wanna see a film which doesn t need too much concentration which can be watched by the whole family and which teaches your children modest and conservative values besides the modern tolerance stuff you will be fine with this film Might be shown at a family home evening
I expected this to be a lot better I love Tim Burton s work so I was really excited to see these online short films Well they weren t at all what I had expected br br I don t really know what exactly it is I don t like I guess they re just sort of dull The sound bothers me and most of the characters although I loved Roy the Toxic Boy and Stainboy br br The Match Girl episode probably bugged me the most although it was pretty funny br br I also don t like the way some of the characters die Like how Match Girl basically set the gas station on fire or how the Girl Who Stares died in general Roy s death was amusing surprisingly Death by a car freshener Very original That made me laugh so hard br br There are some things that aren t appropriate for kids Just some language and gore That s about all I have to say 3 10
i wasn t sure whether to laugh or cry Porretta was good looking but resembled like a Mexican porn star not an English outlaw costumes what costumes a t shirt with strips of black leather on it it was Marion s clothes or lack of them that really got me do the fans of this stinker really believe women dressed like that in medieval england the Mongols and vikings were inaccurate and stupid but the episode with an ALIEN was worst of all Especially as his make up mainly consisted of oatmeal on his face an old trick The hedgehog monster was pretty funny as was climbing up the side of a castle on a ladder of arrows as if the US accents grated as did the initial drawling voice over RAW bin Hood and LIDDLE John the second robin and Marion were really quite minging in looks and what was left of the show went totally down the pan
This series is one of the worst shows I have ever seen Terrible acting terrible effects terrible writing you get my drift The stories are so far from the legend of Robin Hood it s amazing Looks like they just wanted to use the name Robin Hood to attract an audience It might as well have been called New Adventures of Mr Bland Acting br br Someone commented before me that if you had imagination you d love this show That is a horrible approach to a TV series A visual media like this should spark your imagination you shouldn t have to force your imagination into something to make it good That would be like the Simpsons episode where they try to brainwash Homer with a religious propaganda movie and he starts talking about who killed who or whatever If a movie is boring I just make up my own story br br In conclusion Absolute human waste
Does anything at all happen in this movie There are only the bizarre short scenes where I didn t know what the hell was going on so that doesn t count This movie is sooo boring it hurts and this is coming from a person who likes it when movies are about making movies Confused well I was after watching this crap What was Donald Sutherland on because he missed it with this one completely And what s with the pedofile scene at the beginning of the movie Can put anyone to sleep 4 10
As was to be expected A Mazursky film made in the 70s would be counter culture sympathetic towards the hippies and have a lot of hippies in it and naturally it is childishly anti authoritarian e g the scene on the Mexican border when Sutherland provokes a custom s officer by showing little respect and then accuses the latter of making him open his luggage only because he Sutherland has long hair The constant left wing dribble could have gotten on my nerves had I not been prepared for it beforehand Sutherland muses aloud to his family and friends about potential movie ideas for his next film and most of these ideas are either about blacks or Indians needless to say he would be welcomed with open arms in today s Hollywood One of his movie ideas is about a black uprising in Beverly Hills a race war so to speak in the middle of L A This is the kind of nonsense that Mazursky thinks about when writing scripts for his movies Fortunately some of Sutherland s hippie friends make fun of this black revolution premise and the resulting dialogue isn t bad a little later the Jewish guy makes a crack about Sutherland making a movie about masturbation and the black problem when the latter starts talking about masturbation Another funny moment is when Sutherland s older daughter performs some PC crap on stage with her white school mates and they all say We the black people of the Republic of South Africa br br There is always a certain amount of self indulgence when Hollywood makes a movie about Hollywood especially when it s Hollywood making a movie about Hollywood discussing Hollywood doing movies Now that s very very self indulgent indeed The scene with Fellini playing himself is more amusing than annoying though Mazursky throws in the standard flower children and anti Vietnam bullshit into the soup and also pokes fun at corporate Hollywood but he was is just as much a part of the phony Hollywood lyrics from that song in the surreal war segment as anyone else I am pretty sure that he too makes phony small talk in Beverly Hills parties and grins fakely while shaking the hands of people whom he either doesn t know or like but whose money he wants badly for his next left wing project As for his hair he has the worst hair I ve seen in a very long time on film or elsewhere it s sort of like the kind of long hair that a middle aged accountant would have if he grew it long The film remains relatively interesting in spite of its aimlessness but it bogs down somewhat into tedium in the last third If you d like to read my parody biography of Donald Sutherland and other Hollywood actors contact me by e mail
I know nothing of the Iliad so can not comment on it s accuracy to that story However as a stand alone film I found this very boring The battle scenes tried to be large and spectacular but they were just obvious CGI br br The acting is poor and no doubt Brad Pitt was cast just to attract the ladies But he does not make a good warrior too pretty i am afraid br br Good points are is the design This film does look good with the landscape and castle buildings walls impressive I do like a film that at least tries to get the characters accents true but this film just seems to ignore it completely we hear American Scottish English anything but what you might expect for a film about an ancient eastern civilisation br br All in all I do not recommend this film for a family sit down It is too long and the young will get bored br br For adults it is OK if you don t care about the lack realism
Well were to start This is by far one of the worst films I ve ever paid good money to see I won t comment on the story itself it s a wonderful classic but here it feels like a soap opera To start with the acting except for Eric Bana is soap opera quality I ve always been a fan of Brad Pitt but here every actor on The Bold and the Beautiful puts him to shame The camera action doesn t help either How it lingers on him when he s thinking it just takes me back to Brooke Forrester s days in the lab Peter O Toole has either had a really bad plastic surgery or he is desperately in need of one Either way he looks more like Linda Evans than Linda Evans And to end my comments Diane Kruger is a cute girl but she sure is no Helen of Troy Peterson should rather have chosen Saffron Burrows for the role since Elizabeth Taylor would be rather miscast by now
To confess having fantasies about Brad Pitt is a pretty tough admission for an heterosexual to make But what can I tell you Maybe is that famous extra something that everybody talks about and makes a star a star It crosses that barrier It pulls you into unknown sensual and emotional territory Brando had it in spades Montgomery Clift Gary Cooper James Dean of course and in more recent times Tom Cruise Jude Law Johnny Depp Ewan McGregor and Billy Crudup Women fell in love with Garbo Dietrich Katharine and Audrey Hepburn Grace Kelly Marilyn Monroe Julie Christie Charlotte Rampling Meryl Streep Vanessa Redgrave Julia Roberts and very very recently Natalie Portman But Brad Pitt has singlehandedly redefined the concept He is the only reason to go out get in the car find parking buy a ticket popcorn and get into a theatre to see Troy If you liked epics in the Jupiter s Darling style you may enjoy this But if you don t go all the same we want to keep Brad Pitt in business
I like Brad Pitt enormously He is an actor with brains and wit not to mention face pectorals and all the rest Since I saw him in Thelma and Louise a thought has been bothering me who does he remind me of Troy did it for me He is the new Brigitte Bardot The differences are obvious of course Male American etc but Brigitte Bardot comes to mind nonetheless He is so beautiful that he is at his most effective when he plays against it Kalifornia 12 Monkeys Fight Club Snatch His self deprecating humor makes him human almost accessible Fortunately Troy will soon be forgotten Only still photographs with Pitt semi naked in ravishing sprint positions will decorate the walls of legions of salivating fans Strange Das Boot is one of the great films of the second part of the 20th Century What is Wolfgang Petersen doing directing this Well I suppose it would be very hard to say no at the chance of working with the new Brigitte Bardot
Went to see the movie Troy this afternoon Here s what I learned br br Contrary to popular opinion and history in general Greek men were not gay EVER This was clearly established immediately at the start of the film and reinforced every five minutes or so thereafter So it is safe for American dudes to see this movie br br Helen of Troy always had impeccable hair and makeup She looked gorgeous in all of her brief cameo scenes which though numerous were probably all filmed on the same day one after the other with the director saying Alright now look beautiful good OK now look frightened good now look depressed good now look interested good now look beautiful again good br br Most Greek and Trojan men had British accents Those with American accents couldn t act br br Trojans looked just like Greeks but they tended to stay on the right side of the screen br br Brad Pitt does not blink on camera br br Helen of Troy s biggest line was They re coming for me br br Trojan music sounded remarkably like modern Bulgarian music br br Brad Pitt s thighs go all the way up br br Achilles had a young male friend with whom he was very close but it s OK They were cousins Never mind what history says br br Peter O Toole can tell an entire story with just an expression br br Trojan gods apparently all had Greek names but their statues either looked Egyptian or like Peter O Toole in drag br br Greek men never touched each other unless they were fighting much like American men br br All of the thousands of extras in the movie had exactly the same skin color Light Egyptian by Max Factor br br Troy had only three women br br There were lots of blond Greeks which is good news for Brad Pitt who would otherwise have really stuck out br br Despite their coastal desert locale Greeks had the uncanny ability to find unlimited amounts of timber to build fires funeral pyres Trojan horses and the like br br British actors look silly with Greek hairdos br br Brad Pitt changes expression only when the sun is shining directly in his eyes br br Greek soldiers fought constantly but their outfits always looked impeccable br br Greek soldiers wore underwear under their skirts br br Apparently Greek temples were always in ruins even back when they were all new
Hello there br br This is my first post in IMDb even though I use it as a reference for quite a while I would therefore like to salute you all The fact that I am a Greek is inevitably going to affect my judgement I hope not to your annoyance br br I spent 2 years of my life all we Greeks did actually analysing Omirus epos and not Homers as you see everywhere rhyme by rhyme If I recall well it was Iliada Iliad on 8th grade and Odysseia Odyssey on 9th grade Warner s Troy was a big disappointment to me and my fellow Greeks around the campus I study in the UK br br Iliad epos is one of the very best literature works ever made It was composed by a Greek poet Omirus a whole 400 years after the actual war Historians put Trojan war around 1200 BC and the actual reason of the war not being Helen s beauty but the strategically crucial position of Troy That said one may now understand that Omirus epos is not presenting the actual events as it s not accurate historically but this was never the purpose of this work br br Reading this huge poem one can find himself wondering for the very definitions of honour love anger hate heroism discipline loyalty and so on The best part and the most educational as well were these prolonged talks between the warriors before the battle None of these though were revealed in Troy br br Warner s Troy was really cheap to my eyes and to other intellectual people English Finnish and German colleagues of me as well It is a shame to spend millions of dollars in such a bad scenario By the way perfect storm was a bad and stupid blockbuster computers graphics did the whole work and yet it is Wolfgang Petersen s best work br br I conclude saying that you d better watch something else instead I would give Troy 2 out of 10 It is a really expensive B movie br br Cheers br br Alex
I had high hopes for Troy and I am so bitterly disappointed The film was directed so badly it made my stomach ache The pacing was so slow the dialogue laughable and the film well apart from a nice fight scene between Achilles Pitt and Hector Bana the rest was shallow br br And why oh why does Hollywood always insist on rewriting stories to fit consumer approval Agamemnon didn t die in Troy the war lasted 10 years and Achilles was killed by Paris OUTSIDE the walls of Troy with an arrow to the ankle It annoys me that such a classic story as this is turned into a soap br br And don t even start me on the lack of chemistry between Helen and Paris She was the woman the war was fought over and it didn t even look as if the two of them cared a great deal about the other No sparks no emotion no hope br br I have to say in the films defence Brad Pitt Eric Bana and Peter O Toole acted very well with a bad script but that isn t enough to save this awful movie br br Can anybody tell me where the 200 million budget went Maybe in all the trees they used for the funeral pyres where did they get all those trees br br I am so disappointed it hurts
I had the greatest enthusiasm going in to the advance screening for this movie After all this is one of the oldest and most complex tales known to mankind and it was one of the first epic tales I read as a kid even before Tolkien I must say that IT WAS A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT They completely made the plot into a joke and turned the thing into one long soap opera The elements that WERE faithful to the plot were sprinkled throughout in such a haphazard manner that the audience was laughing at many times at the silly script that just paid lip service to this battle of all battles It was a huge disappointment to see a complex character like Achilles who has a strange combination of nearly Matrix like powers utter ruthlessness and male lovers in the original poem turn to Fabio on the beach in the guise of Pitt who with a good script and more effort could have turned this into the most complex and original warrior figure Hollywood has ever produced The actors were actually decent trying to make the best of a ridiculous script It was actually a waste of so much talent Peter O Toole stole the show and Orlando Bloom and Sean Bean were pathetic Compare it to LOTR or Gladiator and it doesn t even hold a candle to them Plenty of hunks for the ladies to goggle over but not enough battle scenes for a movie that is about one long battle and siege I wouldn t recommend that anyone pay to see this story dragged through the dirt like one of the characters was at least they got that part right
I have walked out of about 6 movies my entire life This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen I don t know how I sat through an hour of it I must have been in a coma that night I saw it in the theatre when it came out 8 years ago I couldn t even remember the name but I knew that Penelope Ann Miller starred in it It must have really affected me to be wasting my time commenting on it today Yech Vomit Barf
The box for To Die For suckered me in a shirtless hunky guy and the promise of some laughs and sex There was plenty of Thomas Arklie Simon who s easy on the eyes but no laughs and little sexiness br br The couple Mark and Simon have allegedly been together several years but neither character is interesting enough to care about so it s hard to imagine that they care about each other The fault seems to lie in the script not the performances both actors do the best they can with what they re given br br The ending is sappy and unaffecting well not totally unaffecting I felt relief that it was over br br If you re looking for a movie about gay relationships and AIDS that s funny Parting Glances is far better
I had read a few positive reviews of this film and was truly surprised at how dreadful the whole thing was Positioned as some cross between an AIDS related story and some kind of Ghost Blithe Spirit tale this film can t always make it s mind up what it wants to be br br Simon and Mark are a gay couple who have an open relationship Simon is able to have anonymous though safe sex on the side when he wants Mark is HIV and he and Simon don t seem to have a sex life anymore When Mark dies Simon who has made a habit of shutting off his emotions after being rejected years ago by his father tries to erase his memory and just get on with being a bachelor Not that his behavior before Mark s death was much different But Mark returns in ghostly form and foils his various trysts while getting Simon to open up and admit his true feelings br br Unfortunately Simon is such a selfish SOB it s impossible to feel any empathy toward him for most of the film By the time he is supposed to be more sympathetic it s too late to care Mark on the other hand follows in Demi Moore s footsteps from Ghost by crying profusely throughout the movie br br There is a bizarre switch in tone after Mark returns Suddenly we get some lame attempts at humor a la the TV show Bewitched But that doesn t last long Once Simon s emotional health is at stake the whole thing becomes increasingly mawkish with amateurish attempts to jerk at your heartstrings The finale with a gold plated muscle boy angel guiding a tearful Mark to heaven while a chastened grief stricken Simon waves goodbye is just stupefying chiefly because it isn t intentionally funny
This film is riveting but in much the same way a car crash is riveting It s hard to look away Overall this film is nothing more than an incredibly irresponsible social experiment and a futile biased experiment at that The filmmakers are manipulative and seem to have no problems going for the lowest possible denominator The manner in which the money is presented to Ted is pure exploitation The intervening steps that the filmmakers force Ted to participate in meeting with so called experts were empty and devoid of any substantive attempt to connect with Ted Instead it s painfully obvious that they serve to cover the filmmaker s posteriors and to further exploit Ted s situation The worst part is that the filmmakers stop following Ted after 6 months and seemingly are cut off entirely from the subject they had followed so closely months before If they had cared they would have found better experts to help Ted If they truly wanted to see what Ted would do then they should have let him spend the money without any intervention This film is at best a high brow Jackass stunt and not a documentary It s sad to think how much 100 000 could have actually changed a homeless person s life had it been put in the right hands
What happens when you give a free man just enough money to trap him into the rat race and watch him squirm Homeless people answer to no one They have no mortgages rent payments or idiot bosses Homeless people don t have to worry about the IRS or performance reviews or credit card payments But give them just enough money to rent an apartment and buy a car and suddenly they have to worry about entering the rat race buying gas for transportation paying insurance on their car and working for someone else They get a chance to be a productive citizens This film was about as exploitive as a film can be It s a way for the rich and middle class sheeple to say see what happens when you try to help the poor and it vindicates capitalistic arrogance br br Why not a film that asks What happens when you take away everything a rich man has
as always this is an inaccurate picture of the homeless TV told a lot of lies about panhandlers in the early 1990s and made everyone look bad and claimed we all made over 100 a day when 20 40 a day was much closer to reality when someone drove by where i held up a sign offering to work and offered me work i actually went and took the work if i was physically able and if i would been offered the 100 000 id damned sure invested in in apt prepaid for at least 2 years and kept most in the bank and still left myself 10 20000 for NL 1 2 and 2 5 cash games at the casinos i usually always win and could win decent if i just had a bankroll instead i win about 1000 a month is all playing in always minimum buying in due to not wanting to risk losing it all i was only homeless cause i didn t wanna risk spending all my money and going broke sometimes i had over 1000 2000 in my sock while i slept outside anyone wanting to talk contact sevencard2003 on yahoo messenger i admit i was different than most homeless people though due to the fact i never drank smoke or took drugs im no longer homeless am now in govt housing for 177 a month and getting SSI and spend most of my time winning at online poker mom and sunflower diversified worked hard to get me SSI glad my days of hiding in under the stage in the convention center of the casino at night sleeping worrying about getting caught by security are finally over had this TV crew picked me theyd been over a lot sooner its a shame how they don t better select who they pick
What happens when you give a homeless man 100 000 As if by asking that question they are somehow morally absolved of what is eventually going to happen The creators of Reversal of Fortune try to get their voyeuristic giggles while disguising their antics as some kind of responsible social experiment br br They take Ted a homeless man in Pasadena and give him 100 000 to see if he will turn his life around Then with only the most cursory guidance and counseling they let him go on his merry way br br What are they trying to say Money can t buy you happiness The homeless are homeless because they deserve to be Or how about Lift a man up it s more fun to watch him fall from a greater altitude They took a man with nothing to lose gave him something to lose and then watched him dump it all down the drain That s supposed to be entertainment They dress this sow up with some gloomy music and dramatic camera shots but in the end it has all the moral high ground of car crash videos only this time they engineered the car crashes and asked What happens when you take down a stop sign
Don t spend your money or your time on this pitiful piece of film in the guise of cinematography When every third word is devoted to foul language and there is no real plot as well as having a cast of old actors who are still giving the same dated performances from the past and have not evolved in their careers leaves a lot to be said I was expecting something better from award winning actor Benicio del Toro The vision that others may have of Puertorricans will be irreversibly distorted by such trash as Maldeamores A foul word at a given moment in a film may be used to emphasize a given point of view and may even be funny or sad depending on its context see the movie Elsa and Fred for example but it should not permeate the plot The movie is a total embarrassment and there was absolutely nothing funny or even cute about this film
This film is a good example of how through media manipulation you can sell a film that is no more than a very unfunny TV sitcom In Puerto Rico the daily newspaper with the widest circulation has continuously written about the marvels of this film almost silencing all others Coincidentally the newspaper with the second largest circulation belongs to the same owners The weekly CLARIDAD is the only newspaper on the island that has analyzed the film s form and content and pointed out all its flaws clichés and bad writing br br Just because a film makes a portion of the audience laugh with easy and obvious jokes and because one can recognize actors and scenery does not make it an acceptable film
Charles Bronson continued his 80 s slump with what could possibly be his worst movie of the decade if not ever In it he plays a detective who goes to great lengths to track down a pimp who has abducted an Asian girl and is currently selling her to the highest bidder It s a shameful attempt at action and is quite possibly the most depressing movie ever made A lot of people consider the Death Wish sequels to be Bronson s worst movies The Death Wish sequels weren t great movies but were in most cases competently made and very watchable Kinjite however is an utterly dull thriller which is punctuated by mean spirited racism and child molestation It really is a rephrensible film and all of it is made worse by the fact that it tries to preach a Law and Justice mentality that is too overwrought to really say anything Indeed the movie begins with underage sex being interrupted with Bronson then anally raping the pedophile with a dildo The Chicago theater I watched this in just gasped at the awkwardness of this scene only to gasp at the awkwardness of the pimp raping the girl in this film It has no point other than to exploit and really the movie wasn t well written enough to rise above the exploitation level and deliver something that would work Bronson seems more into things but clearly this is far too repugnant to save I want to point out that I think Charles Bronson is the coolest actor ever but this effort is ultimately his worst The action sequences are poor also br br 1 2 out of 4 Awful
Repugnant Bronson thriller Unfortunately it s technically good and I gave it 4 10 but it s so utterly vile that it would be inconceivable to call it entertainment Far more disturbing than a typical slasher film
The 80 s were not very kind to one time major star Charles Bronson Starting with 1982 s Death Wish II and ending with this truly gruesome film from 89 Bronson s screenwriters seemed to be trying to top each other in progressive grossness D W II left little to the imagination in its depiction of the rape and suicide of Bronson s character s daughter a rape and murder of his housekeeper was also shown in disgusting detail 10 to Midnight was the sort of loathsome film that made you want to take a bath afterwards Nothing redeeming about it Other films like The Evil that Men Do and the remaining Death Wish films from this period straddled the line between high camp and high barf with their earnest depictions of brutality and revenge I m not sure if the producers usually Pancho Kohner got a kick out of showing a weary looking senior citizen aged Bronson destroying punks young enough to be his grandchildren or what but the shoddy craftsmanship and terrible scripts of these films usually destroyed what little energy they may have generated br br Kinjite the last of these films is fairly well made but truly takes the cake in cinematic wretchedness In this film Bronson sodomizes a perverse john forces a pimp to eat his Rolex watch allows a male prisoner to get raped by another prisoner makes incredibly xenophobic remarks among other things I ve thankfully forgotten Also depicted is the gang rape of a young Japanese girl fortunately this was off screen though well implied br br What were people thinking when they made this film What was Bronson thinking when he decided to ruin his career with these horrible films For anyone interested in his best movies check out most of the films he made in the 60 s and 70 s like The Mechanic Death Wish From Noon til 3 Once Upon a Time in the West Red Sun The Great Escape The Magnificent Seven Rider on the Rain etc etc
Offering a killer combo of terrible writing terrible acting and terrible direction it s a tossup whether Kinjite Forbidden Subjects is offensively bad or just hilariously bad It s almost as if someone ran a competition to make the sleaziest seediest Cannon film As if a glance at a cast list including characters like Lesbian Pedophile Perverted Gentleman Porno Actress weren t enough it s your only chance to see Charles Bronson s cop throw a lowlife on a bed and grab a dildo but don t worry it s okay as the offscreen screams make clear he s only torturing him for information After all even if he is a bit overprotective of his nice Catholic daughter he s a nice Catholic cop who regularly brings local Catholic priest William O Connell a packed lunch and who believes in poetic justice or at least ensuring that the bad guys end up in the slammer with the horniest inmates maximum security can provide to give them a taste of their own medicine But then that s what you get for telling him Look I think you re a little bit unstable Still when later offered a bribe he may snarl I d like to shove this up your ass but I don t want to get my hands dirty he s clearly learned where to draw the line instead he just makes him eat a 25 000 watch and sets fire to his Cadillac The anal obsession even follows through to the film s title despite the poster featuring a naked Japanese girl on a porn film set the film s only direct example of Kinjite forbidden subjects as Alex Hyde White s English teacher explains to a group of Japanese businessmen is er talking about your bowel movements in polite society br br Bronson isn t just too old for this as the opening fight makes only too clear he s too old for love interest Peggy Lipton and she looks old enough to have grown up kids A better actor than he ever got the credit for when given the right material here s he s given less a properly thought out character than a series of outrageous reactionary quirks When he s not widening the circles of suspects he s accidentally dropping them to their death off the sides of buildings He s definitely not a P C copper with a special loathing for the Japanese as if it wasn t bad enough that they re buying up American businesses what s worse they double park on a public thoroughfare No racial minority goes unassaulted be they black pimp or Pakistani hotel clerk no cop cliché unrecycled be it a boss who bangs his fist on the table or a dead meat partner Perry Lopez and his spectacularly bad hair dye that s so prominent it deserves screen billing all its own The twin plot strands Bronson s L A cop trying to take down Juan Hernandez s pimp who deals in underage girls and James Pax s porn obsessed Japanese businessman take forever to intertwine and then in the most unlikely of ways after copping a feel of Bronson s daughter on a bus Some Oriental guy touched my holy of holies in the film s idea of poetic justice Pax finds his own daughter kidnapped by Hernandez You half expect the writer to pop his head round the corner of the screen and say How d ya like them apples br br Somewhere underneath all the laziness is the germ of a good idea even if it is too muddily developed to ever be clear quite what that idea really is but the execution is pure Rising Sun the Archie Bunker Version shot like out takes from an R rated 80s music video with an outrageous and rather lazy dockside shoot em up and blow em up finale that sees a small army of machine gunning sidekicks suddenly appear to up the gratuitous body count The last of Bronson s mostly bad to in different collaborations with J Lee Thompson and sadly Thompson s last film as director it s a poor signoff for two undervalued players who increasingly never seemed to be that discerning about what pictures they said yes to
Charles Bronson stars as Lt Crowe a police detective who declares war on a pimp named Duke Juan Fernandez who kidnaps the daughter of a Japanese businessman who is the man who sexually harassed Crowe s daughter Amy Hathaway in this sleazy yet stylishly helmed revenge thriller Kinjite may not be for everyone with it s somewhat disturbing plot threads but it is well made and indeed entertaining
When great director actor combinations are talked about the team of J Lee Thompson and Charles Bronson is not usually mentioned Probably because the output of nine joint ventures between the two of them runs the gamut from the really good action entertainment to the mediocre Unfortunately Kinjite Forbidden Subjects falls in the latter br br That s sad because Kinjite could have been a whole lot better But for the life of me I don t understand why it was necessary to make the father of the missing Japanese girl a guy used to getting some cheap jollies because the romance in his marriage has run out That might have been good for another film altogether but it served no purpose here br br A straightforward cop drama with Charles Bronson as a vice cop who s seen a bit too much in his line of work and has a strong prejudice against orientals That part could also have used a little explaining as well But he s going to have to overcome it if he and patient partner Perry Lopez are going to locate a captured Japanese school girl br br Bronson s time in the vice squad have told him exactly where to look for the kidnapper A stylish murderous pimp played by Jaime Fernandez is the guy and he and Bronson have some history In fact in the film s best scene Bronson made him eat an expensive rolex watch and set his car on fire br br At one point Fernandez happens to spot Bronson and Lopez in an all night delicatessen and this being after his rolex snack he sprays the place with an Uzi killing everyone but Bronson and Lopez I really think that little incident would have had more than a couple vice cops from the LAPD after Fernandez But that s another terribly big hole in the plot br br Still there is a very rough justice in the end for Fernandez I wish the whole film had been better though This was the last film of the Bronson Thompson team and J Lee Thompson s last as a director He should have gone out with something better
The husband and wife team of Bennie Fields and Blossom Seeley were huge stars in vaudeville yet they made very few films As is the case for some other performers of their era George M Cohan Fanny Brice Gertrude Lawrence the most accessible piece of film footage for Fields and Seeley is the biopic ABOUT them in which they re portrayed by other actors Somebody Loves Me starring Betty Hutton and that inimitable song and dance man Ralph Meeker br br In their heyday Fields and Seeley were so hugely popular that another husband and wife vaudeville act Jesse Block and Eve Sully achieved nearly as much stardom performing an almost identical act effectively becoming the second team Fields and Seeley Offstage though there was a major difference in the couples living arrangements Fields and Seeley lived in hotel suites paying room service rates for every meal they ate and eventually running out of money Block and Sully lived modestly and invested their earnings wisely ending in comfortable retirement br br The first 30 seconds of this Vitaphone short are occupied by two spats wearing pianists Apparently these two men had some slight name value of their own in 1930 although I ve never heard of them Finally Fields and Seely rush in and start performing They both have plenty of pep and she s fairly attractive br br I was annoyed that both performers keep making movements as if they re about to break into a dance but they never quite do so until the third of the three songs they perform in this short When they finally start hoofing the results are not impressive br br I was delighted to have this opportunity to see these two major performers doing their vaude act Now that I ve seen it I understand why they never became stars in movie musicals My rating for this one just 4 out of 10 and I ll stick with Block and Sully
This is one of the most boring horror films I have ever seen as it s absolutely god awful John Carradine has very limited screen time All the characters are boring and the story is terrible plus I could see the two twists at the end coming miles away The great setting and the creepy house definitely would have helped if it wasn t so damn boring and there isn t one character to root for either plus I hope it makes it s way to the bottom 100 because it deserves to be there in my opinion When John Carradine finally shows up at the end it s a pretty good scene but it s already way too late and the only other screen time he had was in flashbacks plus the only really gory scene in the movie is when a character gets his face messed up by Bee s as it was rather gory I got this in a DVD Horror set called Back From The Grave and everyone really overacts in my opinion plus it s lucky this was included in a set I bought otherwise I would have chucked this out the window This is one of the most boring Horror films I have ever seen as It s absolutely god awful John Carradine has very limited screen time and I say avoid it like the plague you don t want to go through the torture The Direction is absolutely terrible Carl Monson does an absolutely terrible job here making every thing look cheap wasting his potential on making creepy atmosphere and just keeping the film at an incredibly dull pace The Acting is just as bad John Carradine is good in his scene but other then that he s hardly in the film other then flashback scenes Carradine Ruled Merry Anders overacts here terribly as Laura as she didn t convince me at all Ivy Bethune is OK and somewhat creepy but also overacted she did have a creepy smile at the end though Rest of the cast I didn t pay enough attention too as I had a lot of trouble getting through it but they were all really bad Overall please avoid this It s not worth the agony BOMB out of 5
Back when I was a kid and I lived with my sister she bought every horror movie she could find and this was one of them VCR S had just became a household item and we didn t have but about 150 movies and we watched the hell out of all of them br br I was at a yard sale the other day and I saw this VHS copy of BLOOD LEGACY and I buy any horror movie I don t have and I knew this movie looked familiar I thought for a second and realized it was one that my sister had bought She had sold it years ago in a yard sale I am guessing who knows br br I didn t recall anything at all about it and I watched it the night I bought it and it refreshed my memory because of a few scenes I am not sure how I felt about it as a kid but I am sure I enjoyed it because it was new to me and I d watch and enjoy anything back then br br I am a horror freak but there are certain requirements in order for me to consider it good and this one fell very short It was one of those talk talk talk and bore me to death types What death scenes you see are done using the shadow on the wall followed by blood splatter and thats if you re lucky you get that much br br The story is good and I have seen a few with similar plots so I think this one should be buried and forgotten Don t watch this people unless you re hard up
OK how s this for original this mean rich old geezer leaves his estate to his adult children all of them ungrateful losers and two creepy servants provided they spend the week in his spooky old house What happens that night will surprise only those who haven t seen a movie or television show before After a string of murders in which the victims look like they re bleeding restaurant ketchup we have a painfully obvious twist ending The cast is lead by some once respectable actors must have been desperate for their paychecks There are also a few second tier actors who were rising at the time but long forgotten now As a result the film generates all the drama and mystery of an episode of Matlock I will give credit where it s due the closing scene is clever and amusing if you re still awake
You know a movie will not go well when John Carradine narrates a k a reads the script plot synopsis over his character s funeral procession a mere 5 minutes into the movie The narration is his character s last will testament It stipulates that his estate be divided amongst his 4 children and servants The children shall split 136 million equally but if any should die then that share is split amongst the remainders If all the children should die then it is divided amongst the servants To be eligible they must live in the family estate for a week It sounds like the typical plot of a reality show br br There is little subtext as to the nature of the Deans They are a powerful and severely dysfunctional family but the real trouble starts with the drowning of that dog From the opening voice over by John Carradine you expect this movie will lead to a Machiavellian cat and mouse game with a twist ending br br That journey is painfully slow and pointless We trudge through minutes of watching people sitting around playing pool throwing darts the misuse of the through the fish bowl shot dramatic conversations between silk cravat wearing men constant bickering misplaced circus music bizarre flashbacks reminiscent of faux German expressionism the horror aesthetic of the 4th grade and heaps of dramatic overacting This all inevitably leads to the expected ungratifying ending You will be happy to still be alive but the pain might be too great to bear alone Share children share br br Celluloid Rehab
A family of terrible people must remain in a house for a week or else they will lose their inheritance which will go to the servants who will only get their inheritance if they agree to stay on and keep the house in order People die and so will you if you try to sit through this If you ve ever had any desire to see bad actors many with ill fitting dentures act or attempt to act in a bad horror movie this is your chance This is just awful Its so bad I thought Al Adamson one of the worst directors ever directed it but I was wrong br br Its so bad I don t want to say anything more about it not because it isn t polite but because once I start I may not be able to stop br br avoid
A grade Z horror filmmaker Carl Monson was one of the most prolific directors operating within the field of the low budget gory mayhem His movies are full of inept gore laughable acting boring sub plots and woeful dialogue A mysterious black clad figure is savagely murdering guests staying at the family mansion Unfortunately this film is almost bloodless You don t actually see the murders except with shadows and a few blood splatters The pace is lethargic and the plot is rather uninteresting The acting is merely competent but the lack of gore and mutilation left me disappointed A generous 4 out of 10 Just beware do not mistake Monson s film with Andy Milligan s equally weak Legacy of Blood
I happen to have bought one of those Legacy of Horror 50 movie pack collections and would you believe I m still looking through them to find a good HORROR movie in it Sometimes you find an enjoyable yet campy one like The Devil s Messenger or The Devil Bat or one of the great Alfred Hitchcock s films some aren t horror however and are only on there because Hitchcock directed some horrors and suspense but other times it seems that they put movies like The Island Monster and this on because they can t accept the fact they would easily be forgotten and should be for that matter br br So we open up to sort of a Westing game idea The rich yet cruel and abusive father played by Carradine the one standing feature of this has died and left his inheritance to his children and servants who he still hates Carradine gives a good enough performance as always but he s left mainly in a voice recording and flashback sequences leaving us to sit through the mediocre terrible performances The rest of the cast either overacts or underacts in scenes Given this was an independent film of the 70 s the lighting and effects are pretty limited It s hard to build a lot of tension when the viewer can t see what s happening that well in some scenes Some actors like the servants Igor and Elga give an effort at least and I m ashamed to admit kind of left me chuckling at the end mainly for the sheer stupidity but still with some very minor happiness that they pulled some version of a twist to an otherwise pretty obvious who done it but not enough to enhance the quality of the film You aren t meant to like the characters as they are either selfish and cruel or psychotic but it takes it to a whole new level and makes many unwatchable The death scenes are pretty bad and the suspense is not really there It proves that you would probably enjoy the 20 movie pack Chilling containing films like House on a Haunted Hill Little Shop of horror s with Jack Nicholson and Night of the Living Dead over it This is best avoided
Terrible just terrible Probably the worst film I have ever seen And I did see some pretty bad pictures throughout the years The sound sucks so does the quality of the picture the direction the acting etc etc The only good shoots meaning funny because they re so bad are the special effects Overall there are about 5 minutes worth of laughs The rest of the flick gives you brain damage
Blood Legacy starts with the arrival of lawyer Tom Drake Norman Bartold to the Dean estate formerly owned by the now deceased Christopher Dean John Carradine upon his arrival he is greeted by Mr Dean s four children Gregory Jeff Morrow his wife Laura Merry Anders Victoria Faith Domergue Johnny Richard Davalos plus Leslie Brooke Mills her fella Carl Isenberg John Smith Drake plays a tape recording of they re late Father s wishes after his death the estate worth 136 million dollars is to be split equally between his four children if any should die then the money would be split equally between the rest if all were to die the freaky servants Elga Ivy Bethune Igor Buck Kartalian the more mundanely named Frank John Russell would pocket the lot Well not satisfied with a quarter share of 136 million which is still almost 35 million back in 1971 which doesn t sound too bad to me someone decides they want it all for themselves it s not long before decapitated heads are turning up in the fridge br br Co written produced directed by Roy Monson Blood Legacy disappointed me on two accounts For starters this film s alternate much more common title is Legacy of Blood which is also the title of an obscure horror film directed by Andy Milliagn back in 78 which I ve always wanted to see both films are regularly mixed up as both have similar stories when I checked my on screen cable TV guide for Legacy of Blood I was excited because it said it was the Milligan film even listed him as director so when I actually sat down to watch it I heard John Carradine s voice I then knew it wasn t the Milligan film that I had wanted to see my heart sank Then of course there s the simple yet undeniably straight forward fact that Blood Legacy is a total utter piece of crap that is literally painful to watch at times The script by Monson Eric Norden is slow boring extremely predictable The character s are absolutely bizarre in an annoying way the freak of a servant who ask s his sister to cane him the strange set of Brother s Sisters who are just downright unlikeable so far removed from reality that any tension or mystery that the simplistic whodunit story could have achieved is sorely missing then there s the awful twist ending that you can guess within the first 10 minutes It s boring to watch it s poorly paced it s just a chore to even think about it Please someone save me as this is really bad stuff I could go on all day about how bad Blood Legacy is I really could br br Director Monson was either working with a none existent budget or judging by this he shouldn t have even been directing traffic The entire film looks ugly it s poorly photographed there is no atmosphere or scares The blood gore is tame there s an axe in a head a decapitated head a scene when someone is stung to death by wasp s the best murder when someone s face is eaten by piranha However there are question marks over this scene so there s the victim right There s the tank of piranha right Victims head is placed in piranha tank right Pirahna eat victims face right Water remains crystal clear despite said victim having his face eaten erm where s the blood br br Technically Blood Legacy is terrible it looks awful the sound was obviously shot live it s muffled hard to hear which considering the terrible dialogue is maybe a blessing in disguise The acting was not going to win anyone any awards that s for sure the least said about it the better br br Blood Legacy is an awful film there really isn t a single positive aspect to it or if there is I can t think of it Do yourself a favour don t bother with this one there are much better films out there
SPOILERS With a gathering of family members and servants of the late Christopher Dean John Carradine to hear his last will and testament they get somewhat of a surprise in that the Dean fortune some 140 million dollars The money is to be divided between them but only after they successfully spend a week at the Dean mansion There seemed to have been a mix up in the story when we later find out that it s really an overnight sleepover not a weeks vacation at the mansion for the guests to qualify for Dean s money since almost everyone ends up dead by sunrise br br The first victim of the Dean Curse have nothing at all to do with getting and money from the departed Christopher Dean estate the local sheriff Dan Garcia Rodolfo Acosta Acosta has his head chopped off refrigerated and then served on a platter to a shocked group of guests Later that evening cute little Chin Greg and Laura s Jeff Morrow Marry Anders little pet pooch is found dead outside floating in the pond br br The movie has all the people staying at the Dean Mansion being picked off one by one until it s revealed who the killer really is We then have what seems to be a double twist in the story where the original killer is suddenly killed together with two of the last remaining guest The real killer ends up not only getting all the loot 140 million dollars but then ends up not having to split it with his accomplice by doing him or her in by giving him a poisonous cookie that kills him on the spot br br Nonsensical who done it and haunted house movie with a cast of such immoral and unlikable characters that even a mother much less the audience would have trouble liking There s everything you can possibly think of in the move involving the selective guests that includes incest S M sadism and of course double dealing and back stabbing not even counting murder You just couldn t care less who of the guests survives to collect the Dean fortune at the end of the movie hoping against all hope then none of them do br br Even the big surprise at the end isn t really that much of a surprise since the killer s identity is divulged with the film maker having forgotten to keep his face in the shadows so you actual see who he is even before he reveals himself We then have a plot twist that eliminates the killer together with a number of remaining guest just to make the movie a little more confusing then it already is The final plot twist that you can see coming from as far as ten miles away was just to show how smart the very obvious killer was which fooled almost nobody watching the movie
Ridiculous horror film about a wealthy man John Carradine dying and leaving everything to his four children and his servants to be divided up equally One condition they must spend one week in his estate to get the money And if any of them die the others get more Guess what happens next br br I saw a brand new print of this film on cable The colors were bright and vivid and the house itself looks beautiful That s about all the good things I can say about it br br Let s list just some of the problems this film has the killer is screamingly obvious the servants are called Igor and Elga come on some of the sound recording was so bad I couldn t make out the dialogue no great loss I m sure the gore was sparse and very poorly done the other murders were simply boring stupid or impossible and this movie contains some truly abominable acting so bad you just stare at the screen in disbelief Even pro Jeff Morrow was terrible The only fairly good acting was from trouper Faith Domergue who deserved better than this and John Carradine who looks painfully old and frail here I do have to admit though the closing line in this movie is a gem br br Why this was renamed Legacy of Blood is beyond me there s another 1978 horror film with that name br br Whatever its name is it s a bad movie To be avoided at all costs
This Hamlet made for one of the boringest MST3000 episodes ever I am not a Shakespear fan but I do not believe he ever intended his works to be this slow paced and drab It is also one of the hardest movies to find because there are so many Hamlets listed Like I said though this one is quite boring It is in black and white the pacing is slow and there is minimal scenery The actors are all dubbed too so that doesn t help This is the one MST 3000 I can t watch in one sitting cause the way the guy playing Hamlet says his lines can put anyone to sleep

Ming The Merciless does a little Bardwork and a movie most foul
I literally fell asleep 3 times watching this movie Granted it s Shakespeare and that takes a certain mindset to be interested or not But this movie exceeds any barrier of long soliloquies and what not that may prevent many from just not caring about a Shakespeare based story br br The largest roadblock to this production is the complete flatness of the characters Often during character s interacting it s nearly difficult to distinguish who s lines are who s Granted I believe this movie is dubbed in English Certainly they could ve obtained voice actors which could ve added a bit more drama to these classic literary lines br br It would be difficult to rate this movie greater than 1 although perhaps that s based on prejudices of perhaps age and what would seem a very low budget Still it s absolutely painful and boring If you insist on Hamlet do yourself a favor and read the book again 1 10
Poor Will would be rolling over in his grave if he could this this horiible German TV adaptaion of his classic play It s obvious that very little money was spent on it A stage riser a catwalk and some randomly placed columns pass off as a set The movie was ineptly dubbed into English with the English voice actors occasionally mumbling their lines The whole production had an incredibly dark and dreary feel to it And just where was Fonterbras in this movie anyway MST3K gave this sorry production the treatment it justly deserved br br To be or not to be I wish this movie never was in the first place
I m a fan of both Shakespeare and MST3K so I waited anxiously to see this episode I ll comment on the movie first then the MST3K episode The recipe for this movie take talented actors rich and beautiful Shakespeare material and a 1 25 budget Mix well then drain of all life and movement until dull and lifeless Serve cold in a big plain stone cauldron Movie I give 3 out of 10 because the actors at least deserve a little bit of credit Okay now the MST3K episode I ll admit it the first time I saw it I fell asleep halfway through I understand that was the reaction of several other veiwers as well However when I watched it a second time I realized that there was a whole host of intelligent references and good lines I missed the first time around The trick with this episode is listen carefully It takes a couple of viewings to catch each line Give it a second chance and You ll see what I mean MST3K Episode 7 1 2 out of 10
note to George Litman and others the Mystery Science Theater 3000 riff is I don t think so breeder br br my favorite riff is Why were you looking at his like simply for the complete absurdity that and Right well did not over all I would say we must give credit to the MST3K crew for trying to ridicule this TV movie you really can t make much fun of the dialog Bill S was a good playwright on the other hand this production is so bad that even he would disown it a junior high school drama club could do better br br I would recommend that you buy a book and read Hamlet
Alas poor Hamlet I knew him dear reader and let me tell thee THIS VERSION SUCKS I don t know who of all people put up the money for this flotsam but I hope that they re proud of themselves They took THE classic play and turned it into the most boring melodrama imaginable This version is quite literally so bad that not even the presence of a great thespian like Maximilian Schell in the title role can save it This movie s only redeeming quality is that it made great fodder for MST3K Mike Servo and Crow had a lot of fun with this one br br But either way I m sure that Shakespeare had he been alive when they made this would not have wanted his name associated with it This Hamlet is not even so bad that s it good it s just plain bad Absolutely dreadful
Yay I think It s hard to say It s hard to have an emotion about a movie that has no emotion This movie is as sterile as a surgeon s scalpel For a setting it has a few stone pillars some stone seats a couple stone crosses and some stone actors They have no emotion The only thing that saves this movie is the fact that it is Hamlet and Hamlet is a terrificly written piece of literature The dubbing really wasn t all that bad though The voices stuck true to the dull gloomy dreary life sucking atmosphere the movie gave forth I have seen this version of Hamlet on the fabulous Mystery Science Theater 3000 three times and each of the three times I was on the brink of turning off the TV despite it being MST 3K br br Not an uplifting production of a drama that deserves so much better
Take br br 1 a famous play br br 2 a director with now ideas of his own who is using br br 3 a copy of the stage design of a popular theatre production of the play mentioned in 1 br br 4 an actor for the lead who has no feeling for the part he s playing And you ll get Hamlet Prinz von Dänemark br br I listened to the radio play of Hamlet with Maximilian Schell as Hamlet and I was so disappointed I hoped that the filmed version would be better that Schell would at least have a body language to underline what he s saying nothing Then the set the minimalistic design is not everyone s taste but usually I like it when there s just enough on the stage to make clear what s the setting and nothing more Alas that s on a stage in a theatre It won t work in a film based on a play that actually has believable settings That the idea for the set was copied from the theatre production in which Schell played the Hamlet already let s say if that was the only thing to complain about I ask myself how Schell could get the part of Hamlet anywhere in first place and how anybody could allow him to play Hamlet a second time If you ve got the choice to view any of the about sixty films based on Hamlet don t watch this one unless you re a masochist or really hardcore or like to poke fun on untalented actors
There s really not much need to begin this little review with a plot synopsis I mean it s Shakespeare s Hamlet for goodness sake probably one of the best known plays ever written I m not embarrassed to admit that I came to this version of Hamlet the way most people on IMDb have through Mystery Science Theater 3000 While the show may not be the best venue to use to judge a movie in this case I cannot imagine attempting to watch it without the comedic quips In a word this German made for TV version of Hamlet is dreary 152 minutes No way It s too dark and depressing to be anything I want to spend almost three hours on I ve said it any number of times but entertainment is the thing for me And this wrist slitter is far from entertaining I will however give it a couple of points for what I felt was some reasonably good acting A 3 10 sounds about right to me br br As much as I enjoy MST3K their comments don t help to make Hamlet any more palatable There are a few good riffs here and there but overall Hamlet is just the wrong movie for MST3K Shakespeare is far too talky to allow the comedy to have any sort of rhythm or flow As much as it pains me I ve got to give Hamlet a 1 5 on my MST3K rating scale
this verson doesn t mangle the Bard that badly It s still a horrible minimalist production Hamlet s Dutch uncle is inexplicably dubbed by a Spaniard whether it s Ricardo Montalban or not is subject to debate and Maximilian Schell overacts like never before Most of the dialogue makes it through unscathed and the fact that the MST3K version feels obliged to point out repeatedly that the speeches are long duh doesn t strike me as incredibly humorous Mostly it s just bad acting though
I ve seen all kinds of Hamlet s br br Kenneth Branagh s was most ambitious Mel Gibson s was quick and to the point Laurence Olivier s was the best hands down But now we come to Maximilian Schell s take on the Bard br br For one this is a dubbed version of a German TV production of William Shakespeare s venerable chestnut But if there s a slower more plodding more lethargic and worse staged version out there somewhere it must have been acted at grade school level br br Having seen it on MST3K helps with Mike and the robots taking jolly good jabs at the old boy puncturing the profundity of black and white TV Shakespeare and the wisdom of Germans acting out an English play and making it look like an Ingmar Bergman reject br br Of course the best parts are the MST riffs Best lines I m gonna unleash the Great Dane I don t think so breather Meet the Beatles Hey Dad will you help me with my science project and my personal favorite during a party Garrison Keillor s leaving Germany YAAAY br br But then there s Schell playing Shakespeare s greatest character much like a department store mannequin would only not as expressive No doubt he s a great actor but here he comes off about as well as Paul Newman in The Silver Chalice Ever see that one You GOTTA watch these two on a double bill br br In the end this is one instance where it s true that you re much better off to just read the book At least the book isn t dubbed by Ricardo Montalban br br One star only for this Hamlet ten stars naturally for the MST3K version br br Good night not so sweet prince
I read the reviews of this movie and they were generally pretty good so I thought I should see it I m a big Francophile and art film lover but I believe this is yet another case in which the critics make something arty or intellectual into something it is not I will be blunt it contains scenes of sexual perverseness that I never ever wanted to actually see Obviously the piano teacher has some major psychological issues but I really did not want to see them displayed so graphically The film is in essence disgusting I mean when I saw Requiem for a Dream I was repulsed by the last sort of scene with Jennifer Connelly but that was not anywhere near the sort of disgust and repulsion I felt during this film
I rented the video of The Piano Teacher knowing nothing about it other than what was written on the video box I did this with some trepidation because films that win awards at Cannes are usually very good or very bad Unfortunately this one falls in the latter category About one quarter of the way into it I found myself saying out loud This movie is boring About half way through I was saying to myself Where have I seen this before At the three quarters mark I had figured it out br br In spite of its literary origins this film is essentially a remake of Robert Altman s much earlier 1969 and better That Cold Day in the Park Although the details obviously differ and Altman s work was more plot driven and less of a character study the two films are thematically identical There is nothing new to be seen in this production Every aspect of it has been done before a character spiralling out of control with increasingly self destructive behavior Abel Ferrara s Bad Lieutenant 1992 a perverse and doomed love culminating in an operatic near death scene David Cronenberg s M Butterfly 1993 uncommonly brutal sex scenes David Lynch s Blue Velvet 1986 and so on Hence I am bemused by the fact that so many found the film to be shocking shattering etc This highly derivative film seems to have been made for the sole purpose of making viewers feel uncomfortable and clearly succeeded with some However I largely attribute such a reaction to a lack of film viewing experience See enough movies and you really will eventually have seen it all And while it is true that I saw the expurgated R rated version I doubt that the additional scenes would change my overall opinion of The Piano Teacher br br Technically the film is not without merit There is some very good camera work and the lighting is excellent Isabelle Huppert s creditable performance also helps save it from being a waste of time This is the first of Haneke s films that I ve seen and if I were to see more I expect I would have the same opinion of him that I have of Ferrara an interesting director but not nearly the genius others make him out to be Rating 4 10
Although I can see the potentially redeeming qualities in this film by way of it s intrigue I most certainly thought that the painfully long nature in the way the scene structure played out was too much to ask of most viewers Enormous holes in the screenplay such as the never explained your father died today comment by the mother made it even harder to try to make sense of these characters br br This won first place at Cannes in 2001 which is a shock considering Perhaps the French had been starved for film noir that year and were desperate for something as sadistic as this film I understood the long scenes as a device to keep the viewer as uncomfortable as possible but when matched with the inability to relate to the main character it went too far for me and kept me at arms distance from the story altogether br br This is a film for only the most dedicated fan of film noir and one who expects no gratification from having watched a film once it s over I LOVED movies such as Trainspotting or Requiem for a Dream which were far more disturbing but at least gave the viewer something in the way of editing and pacing To watch this teachers slow and painful silence scene after scene just became so redundant that I found it tedious and I really wanted to like this film at every turn
Well the artyfartyrati of Cannes may have liked this film but not me I am afraid If you like the type of film where shots linger for so long that you wonder whether the actor has fallen asleep or the cameraman gone for lunch then it may be for you A large part of it is like this with short sojourns into the realm of unpleasantness I did not find it shocking nor disturbing as some other reviewers have simply a little distasteful and pointless The only reason I did not give this one star is that the acting is commendable ans the film is fairly well shot The plot however has little to recommend A large part of the film just shows a grumpy woman teaching or listening to piano which might appeal to some people But lest you think this is harmless enough be prepared for some snatches of pornography and sexual violence just to wake you up with a bad taste in your mouth Not recommended
I do not fail to recognize Haneke s above average film making skills For example I appreciate his lingering on unremarkable natural day lighted settings as a powerful way to force a strong sense of realism However regarding the content of this film I am very sad to see that in the 21st century there is still an urge to pathologize domination submission relations or feelings and or BDSM practices The problem that the main character has with her mother is unbelievably topical as is the alienation and uncomprehension felt by Walter I don t mean the frustration of a lover which is not loved back in the same way which is understandable I mean that he looks upon her as if she were crazy or as if he was a monk come on I mean D s is not something new in the world and I think it is rather silly to treat the subject as if it were something freakish or pathological it isn t In general films dealing with this subject are really lagging behind the times br br So for me I feel that this film ends up being quite a programmatical film worried with very outdated psicoanalitical theories isn t it nearly embarrassing and that does not really relate with real life lives and experiences of those engaged in D s relationships personal experience forums irc chatrooms even recent scholar studies will show this
Isabelle Huppert is a wonderful actor The director of La Pianiste understands this providing the viewer with long takes of Huppert s face and these are a pleasure to see Huppert is not an animated actor she registers emotion with the smallest lift of an eyebrow or flicker of a smile br br Other than the enjoyment of watching an experienced actor excel in her profession there is nothing in this movie that makes me want to recommend it Well if you enjoy self mutilation sado masochism and bizarre behavior La Pianiste might work for you Other than these attributes I could not find any redeeming value in it br br Buried in all this strange material there is a kernel of truth People who compete at the very highest level musically athletically whatever begin as strange people and are shaped into stranger people by the competitive environment br br Not worth a trip to a movie theater to relearn this life lesson br br
This movie purports to be a character study of perversion Some reviewers have been gulled into assuming that because perversion is depicted the film is psychologically deep actually considering the salacious material it is surprisingly tedious and shallow with no motivational substance Why is the main character the way she is You won t find out from the script For a better treatment of the same theme and a more entertaining movie try Bunuel s Belle de Jour
Elfriede Jelinek not quite a household name yet is a winner of the Nobel prize for literature Her novel spawned a film that won second prize at Cannes and top prizes for the male and female leads Am I a dinosaur in matters of aesthetic appreciation or has art become so debased that anything goes br br Gobble gobble is the favoured orthographic representation in Britain of the bubbling noise made by a turkey In the film world a turkey is a monumental flop as measured by box office receipts or critical reception Gobble gobble and The Piano Teacher are perfect partners br br The embarrassing awfulness of this widely praised film cannot be overstated It begins very badly as if made to annoy the viewer Credits interrupt inconsequential scenes for more than 11 minutes We are introduced to Professor Erika Kohut apparently the alter ego of the accoladed authoress a stony professor of piano She lives with her husky and domineering mum Dad is an institutionalised madman who dies unseen during what passes for the action br br Reviewing The Piano Teacher is difficult beyond registering its unpleasantness What we see in the film and might read in the book for all I know is a tawdry exploitative nonsensical tale of an emotional pendulum that swings hither and thither without moving on br br Erika whose name is minimally used is initially shown as a person with intense musical sensitivity but otherwise totally repressed Not quite because there s a handbags at two paces scene with her gravelly voiced maman early on that ends with profuse apologies If a reviewer has to yawn extract a leitmotif why not use a pretentious word when a simpler one would do Elrika s violently alternating moods would be it br br A young hunk Walter studying to become a low voltage engineer whatever that is and playing ice hockey in his few leisure moments is also a talented pianist He encounters Elrika at an old fashioned recital in a luxury apartment in what may or may not be Paris In the glib fashion of so much art he immediately falls in love and starts to cherchez la femme br br Repressed Erika has a liking for hardcore pornography shown briefly but graphically for a few seconds while she sniffs a tissue taken from the waste basket in the private booth where she watches br br Walter performs a brilliant audition and is grudgingly accepted as a private student by Erika whose teaching style is characterised by remoteness hostility discouragement and humiliation br br He soon declares his love and before long pursues Erika into the Ladies where they engage in mild hanky panky and incomplete oral sex Erika retains control over her lovesick swain She promises to send him a letter of instruction for further pleasurable exchanges br br In the meantime chillingly jealous because of Walter s kindness to a nervous student who is literally having the shits before a rehearsal for some future concert Erika fills the student s coat pocket with broken glass causing severe lacerations to those delicate piano playing hands br br The next big scene by passing the genital self mutilation etc has Walter turning up at the apartment Erika shares with her mother Erika want to be humiliated bound slapped etc Sensible Walter is for the moment repulsed and marches off into the night br br At this point there s still nearly an hour to go The viewer can only fear the worst Erika tracks down Walter to the skating rink where he does his ice hockey practice They retire to a back room Lusty Wally is unable to resist the hands tugging at his trousers His baby gravy is soon expelled with other stomach contents Ho hum br br Repulsed but hooked perhaps desirous of revenge for the insult so recently barfed on the floor Walter returns to Erika s apartment Can you guess what happens now It s not very deep or difficult Yes he becomes a brute while Erika becomes a victim One moment he s locking maman in her room and slapping Erika the next he s kicking her in the face having sex with her and renewing his declarations of love br br Am I being unfair in this summary Watch the film if you want but I d advise you not to br br Anyone can see eternity in a grain of sand if they re in the right mood I could expatiate at the challenging depiction of human relationships conveyed by this film if I wanted But I prefer not to because this is a cheap and nasty film that appeals to base instincts and says nothing br br I m supposed to say that parentally repressed Erika longs for love ineffectively seeks it in pornography inappropriately rejects it when it literally appears pink and throbbing under her nose belatedly realises that she doesn t like being hurt blah blah blah br br The world has for reasons not explained stunted her She apparently makes a monster out of someone who appeared superficially loving but surely we all know that any man is potentially a violent rapist because that s his essential nature however much he tries to tell himself and the world otherwise br br At the end if you have the patience to be there there s a small twist Before going to the final scene where she s due to perform as a substitute for the underwear soiling student with the lacerated hands Erika packs a knife in her handbag For Walter br br Yes you re ahead of me She stabs herself in a none life threatening area and leaves Roll credits br br If this earned the second prize at Cannes just how bad were the rest of the entries
A movie has rarely left me as cold as this one There is not a bit of tension not a second of fear not a moment we jump even a little bit The girl is cute yeah That s it Was that worth a movie I knew it wasn t supposed to be a great movie but I was at least expecting one
I wasn t really hoping for much when I went to see this After Mst3king the heck out of JasonX with some friends though I was hoping for a similar experience here br br Unfortunately the movie took itself way too seriously Do I care about Jason s problems I m sorry no There are a legion Ft13th movies that cover that anyway At at then end of the day he s an undead serial killer I m just not going to get that sympathetic br br Freddy was by far the most interesting aspect of the movie with the hallucinations and what not but unfortunately they were few and far between and by the end of the movie it had degenerated into a bad episode of celebrity deathmatch only not funny br br
I rented this shortly after renting Ben Stein s Expelled and thought it would interesting to compare them Before I go further it seems only fair that I point out the following so a reader can see if I m prejudiced or not I m trying to be objective for the record br br I tend to enjoy Maher s HBO show now and then though I rarely think he s the source of the humor I don t really care for his stand up either But he makes some good points on the show now and again and I liked Politically Incorrect though he was still fairly politically correct which I deem a negative because the very term sounds Orwellian or at least fascist As for my religious views I ll say for simplicity s sake that I m a non denom Christian with some views that are objectivist and some that are agnostic mixed in br br That being said this a bad documentary for reasons that haven t been touched on yet by many reviewers though the ones mentioned are valid too The reason it s not convincing isn t just that he argues the main point without letting others talk and his point boils down to nothing logical either it s just come on really which isn t a point just a question Try David Hume if you want a decent argument The reason this isn t convincing lies in his lack of experts on the subject matter I saw this about 2 months ago and I only recall him talking to one person whose credentials as a professional were mentioned if he wasn t a clergyman There are probably hundreds of scientists or at least professors with Masters or Doctorates willing to do a bit of verbal sparring particularly in the fields of History Anthropology or a host of others br br If one compares this to Ben Stein s Expelled No Intelligence Allowed he ll find that Stein interviews about 30 credentialed professors professionals clergy etc He does this with a variety of sources with various backgrounds He also makes a point in his film regarding freedom of thought and education Maher could easily have pointed out wrongs committed by theocratic rules throughout centuries or persecutions from this Instead he idiotically refers to the 20th century s secular totalitarian regimes as evidence of why secularism needs more socio political power it s in the bonus features where he s standing in front of the Anne Frank house I think This is a true Orwellian head trip He blames Christianity in particular on many pointless deaths which has had its share though far smaller than most without even including a basic view of the evidence Perhaps this is because that argument is dwarfed by secular humanism s miserable record of the 20th Century ALONE br br Another glaring weakness is his unwillingness to talk to anyone that would be considered a moderate or average practitioner He picks out the weakest gazelles of the herd How difficult is that How does proving the existence of exceptions move toward disproving the general rule It does not Wow so people in cults think outside of the norm How enlightening to know this Great work Maher Again it would be fairly easy to interview someone like Laurence Vance and include his work on refuting the idea of patriotic duty that demands a person fight in any war his country is involved in br br Beyond all that he s just not that funny here Some of the clips that are overlaid in clever out of context irreverent ways might garner a laugh but mostly work to illustrate how a real contextual argument from Maher will NOT be forthcoming much less convincing He spends most of his time bashing Christians spouting inaccuracies and interviewing fringe groups that he doesn t allow to really answer his questions br br For the record there are good questions to honestly ask of religious folks and many they should ask of themselves He touches on almost none of these I get the feeling that I could ve responded much better to most of his questioning than the people he interviewed but the whole thing reeks of deck stacking in terms of what is included and what was edited out
I ve been a fan of all things Bill Maher for 15 years but this film was disappointing and at times disgusting Of course I am Catholic come from a well educated family and go to church of my own volition which probably puts me at ends with quite a few of Bill s opinions br br Bill s problem is that he presumes that religion is uniformly negative He s correct to document the sociological aspects of it i e one faith builds its holidays on top of another and that many wars have been started because of religion or more accurately by the sinister appeals of men to the ultimate and unquestionable authority of God but that said he never looks at its positive side Quite frankly I think that hell would freeze over before Bill would ever humble himself and travel to the slums of Calcutta where Mother Theresa spent her life working with the poorest of the poor She s dead now of course but he could easily visit the Jesuit priest in East LA who runs Homeboy Industries which works with young men typically with gang and prison backgrounds to teach them career skills get their tattoos removed and to become responsible members of society or he could visit USC s Institute for Advanced Catholic Studies which has brought together some of the world s finest theologians diplomats and investment bankers to study ways in which to ethically integrate the world s poorest countries into global capital markets and thereby improve the standard of living for the half of the world s people who live on less than 1 a day Of course he won t do that because that would require him to consider evidence that does not easily fit into his preconceived beliefs about religion and it s so much easier to continue to make snide superficial jokes br br That fits into the other large problem with Bill s movie which is that he never subjects himself to anyone either on his level or who is better than he is In this movie you have Maher the Cornell grad spend most of his time talking down to truck drivers at a nondenominational Christian truck stop service in a night club with a Dutch guy who smokes pot all the time with the minister of a storefront church in Miami who claims to be the reincarnation of Christ and with an actor playing Jesus at a Holy Land theme park br br What you won t see in Bill s film beyond some superficial speculation alongside a Ph D in Grand Central Station that religion chemically alters the brain like drugs do and that religion is the fallacy of tradition wrought on the masses is any sort of serious and questioning interviews with philosophy and theology professors from schools like Notre Dame BYU or Wheaton College who could easily rhetorically decapitate him in a debate on the matter You won t see any serious discussion of any of the writings of C S Lewis G K Chesterton or any papal encyclicals and of course you also won t find any discussion whatsoever of any of the non Abrahamic Judaism Christianity and Islam faiths whatsoever All you get at the end of the day is a textbook example of a condescending snobby elitist from the west side of LA who makes a movie for his own kind and who has absolutely no gut level understanding whatsoever of how the other half of America that elected George W Bush twice lives their lives or about the school of thought behind it br br I get a lot of what Bill s saying but for someone possessing his intellect and influence this film was nothing less than pathetic Anyone interested in the kind of intellectual ferment that indie documentaries typically bring could find more stimulation in an old rerun of the Teletubbies
Now don t get me wrong If you need an insightful summary of everything that been wrong with the history of human civilization as well as a flawless path to brighter future for mankind who better to turn to than a comedian and practitioner of pop culture If you need a healthy dose of all the solid sound reasons why religion has outlived it s usefulness then turn to Sagan or Dawkins not BILL MAHER for God s sake That s a good point in and of itself Maher dismisses our religious past as a neurological disorder conveniently ignoring how his entire society art and science is rooted in it br br In this film he relies heavily on his keenly honed skill set of irony and cynicism to make his point while attempting to appear erudite and wise Unfortunately his intellect isn t up to the task br br Maher makes us laugh but is clearly not the brightest bulb in the box As an example he responds to an interviewee s and I use the term loosely as they were clearly all ambushees assertion that the existence of Jesus is historical fact with a deadpan No it s not followed by a long stare meant to convey contempt at the subject s naivety a device nauseatingly overused in this film The problem is that the person was correct and Maher dead wrong in his assertion that Jesus is mentioned only in what he considers to be the historically suspect gospels I guess Mr Maher has never read the contemporary historian Josephus br br But the masses will flock to this pseudo documentary as they do the fictional works of other intellectual giants like Michael Moore and they will loudly bray and guffaw they certainly did at my showing br br It s doubly telling however that the loudest and most mule like braying occurred during the approximately 70 of the running time that the film devoted to it s anti Christian tirade while the audience was wholly mute during the token 10 devoted to criticizing the self described Religion of Peace Hmmm Either criticism of Islam is off limits to the hip and liberal target audience or they were just afraid to laugh Very telling either way
I saw it I agree with him 100 but I didn t care for his delivery He just came off as an asshole in a poorly edited contrived juvenile smear campaign Edit cuts galore etc The camera would be focused on him and you d see 2 or 3 edit cuts just over the course of a minute or two of dialog Add in the constant boom mikes in the camera shot which is a film no no br br This documentary hits a topic with so many angles so many interesting stories that the movie is just so easily done Picking on religious fanatics is like picking on the retarded kid It is so easy it is just wrong I mean how hard is it to make these people look like nut bags To make them contradict themselves you just let them recite more then a verse or two I do like when he jumped back in forth between people of the same religion and showed them completely contradicting themselves br br I just think he could have done something a little more creative The part with the neurologist talking about brain activity was never fleshed out It could have been interesting to show brain scans of people during religious fits compared to drugs or sex or He could have played more on the women all rejoicing over the Passion play that looked more like a snuff scene in a new Rob Zombie movie More could have gone into the history of John Smith the Mormon founder who had quite the colorful past Delve into science v s religion One is a very methodical very strict process for increasing the confidence in theories It builds on itself from a solid bottom up a new layer on top of a more proved layer An enormous burden of proof is required each step of the way The other starts at the top and comes down with unchallengeable claims It is so because well I said so br br Done right I d say turn it into an HBO original series hit a different religion every week br br It was an eye opener about one thing I must have been blind Good ole G W Bush no wonder he got elected He had the religious majority And well now that is the blind leading the blind br br Bill Moyer Well what can I expect from a guy who hands out at Sutra in Newport beach
This film is really ONLY Bill Maher s interpretation of religion There are several funny moments and some interesting points but don t go into this expecting an even handed discussion of religion This is what I consider to be the worst kind of documentary Everything is arranged ahead of time and in editing to provide you with the opinion of the director rather than letting you make your own decision br br EDITING It s very chopped up inter spliced with clips from pop culture and the media to reinforce the point The interviewee barely has a chance to finish a sentence before he is interrupted by the editing The only people given a fair chance to speak their mind are those who say what Bill Maher wants them to say Once someone deviates from the gospel according to Maher they get edited br br INTERVIEWEES They are meant to represent the absolute MOST extremist religions From the TV evangelical to the ultimate Jewish stereotype to a TRUCK STOP chapel Seriously A TRUCK STOP CHAPEL He s picked the worst money grabbers the heavy extremists and those who don t have the budget to say no to pick on And when he does get a good person to interview he edits the hell out of them br br STEREOTYPING All religions are portrayed as stereotypes Especially hard hit are the Muslims During the Muslim segment he barely gives anyone the chance to speak before interrupting them either himself or through editing in pieces with suicide bombers ALL Muslims are portrayed as gun toting extremists through the editing and none of the people interviewed is edited fairly br br ENDING The message at the end is INCREDIBLY heavy handed and while it is an interesting idea it s not presented with fairness to the countless people who are not religious extremists Bill Maher explains himself while clips of destruction play in the foreground This literally gives the message that religion is stupid and dangerous and that it will destroy the world He also states that everyone involved in religion is stupid br br With the faults to the film it has some good points and the humor while very unfair is actually funny But know going in it is a very one sided view Bill Maher s view of religion He s not discovering anything He s telling you what he thinks br br 4 10 Some good moments but heavy handed with an extremely irresponsible documentary style
Some funny bits but come Bill A film Quoting Zeitgeist Keep the TV Show and the interviews but a film I m probably overreacting but what a unnecessary provoking film I don t know I laughed disagreed agreed this film is very confusing and inconsistent br br Bill s a funny guy but also very cocky Bill s rhetoric is similar to Bill Hicks a brilliant comedian But like many comedians the borderline between comedy and preaching can be annoying I think that the major problem in this film is his lack of sensibility This might be just a personal taste but comedy that constantly demeans somebody cannot be taken as truth Bill is obviously emotionally reactive to religious fundamentalism I agree with Bill that religious fanaticism is not sensible but the response to it cannot be sensible It will create unnecessary turmoil We can do better than just react to fundamentalism His conclusion is that we don t know and he fervently tries to convince the spectator that nobody knows anything to the point that the agnostic community has been concerned with his lack of serious research in comparative religion His humility that he only knows that he doesn t is a contradiction as he tries to insist that all religious thought is non sense br br I had great trouble seeing bits of Zeitgeist the movie in Bill s film All the astrotheology influenced non sense that simplifies all religions as the same is simply disappointing Zeitgeist has provoked a lot of controversy and has messed up the validity of so much of the valuable Religion Studies scholarship It is very sad how wrong facts have been tossed around with no reliable scholarly sources Astro mystic sources that reduce everything to the stars say it all seem to be from the Middle Ages This film is a confusing statement from a confused agnostic Agnosticism is far more complex and philosophically academic than defending every single issue as we don t know br br This film is an obvious proof of how postmodernism has been able to oversimplify and generalize major issues in human history br br Watch the film it has hilarious interviews and bits but PLEASE do not behave like Bill You cannot expect anybody to have a mature conversation if you are making sardonic comments in every other line His arguing techniques are demeaning and insulting provoking emotional reactions rather than rational and logical argumentation There needs to be a more mature way of dealing with these issues
Bill Maher s Religulous is not an attack on organized religion It s an attack on Christianity and Islam Apart from ridiculing a bunch of Rabbis inventing warped machines to get around Sabbath regulations he really doesn t attack Judaism and seems enraged when a Rabbi actually challenges the existence of the State of Israel If Bill Maher followed his hypothesis to its logical conclusion he would realize that the very creation of Israel in the Palestinian Territories is based on the so called holy books of organized religion This is evidence of his complete and utter lack of objectivity or focus in the creation of this film br br I find it really hard to believe that the man is atheist or even all that intelligent Anyone can go up to a religious person and laugh at them and call them stupid for their beliefs but what do you have to offer them in return Nowhere does he actually tell them why he thinks they re stupid What makes him the rational person in the room In a way it reflects how he really isn t and in the process ends up looking just as stupid as those people br br If you want to watch a good movie documentary about the actual evils of religion and how religion can actually be detrimental to the human civilization watch Richard Dawkins Root of All Evil It is a brilliantly researched documentary clearly outlining what it hopes to achieve and how br br Bill Maher s Religulous is not funny poses no interesting questions nor does it provide any insight on so controversial a topic It seems to be the rantings and ravings of an old man disgruntled with his Catholic upbringing I almost feel sorry for him
This was a disappointing film The people seem to have no substance the lead protagonist Martin Cahil has zero redemptive values in fact everyone in it including Jon Voight epitomizes sleeze I would not recommend this film to anyone The violence is distasteful though artfully done The filming is to black at least the print i saw fit this category A disappointment
A craven cowardly film Director Boorman shows Cahill burglarizing rich houses but the male occupant is shown being unfaithful with the nanny thats all right then The forensic scientist investigating Cahill is blown up in his car but he is rat faced sourpuss and doesn t look like a nice man so thats all right too The Beits owner of Russborrough House made their money by exploiting darkies digging up diamonds so it s okay to rob priceless art from them and hide it in a bunker in the Wicklow mountains The Garda kill his ferrets and are implicated in his murder The moral equivalencing is sickening Boorman looks for a hit film but doesn t have the guts to stand against the criminality of the generals gang who terrorized the neighbourhood and unleashed another wave of scumbags upon Dublin He even liaised with the Generals son while making it Disgusting Shame on him for his cowardice
Like with any movie genre there are good gangster movies and there are bad gangster movies If you asked me to name a good gangster movie I d have dozens to choose from If you asked me to name a bad gangster movie probably the first one to pop up in my mind is one that still has me in a sort of depression of disappointment about a week since I saw the film for the first and I promise you the last time That film is The General unrelated to the 1926 silent film of the same name This is a very dry very slow gangster epic that raises questions not about the story it s more than easy to follow but about why the filmmakers chose to make this rather flimsy endeavor br br Like Goodfellas 1990 and American Gangster 2007 two superior mob movies The General is based on real people and true events The film revolves around an Irish criminal named Martin Cahill Brendan Gleeson who started his long chain of crimes stealing food as a teenager and then moving up to robbing museums and houses as an adult Meanwhile the police led by an inspector named Kenny Jon Voight try desperately and vigorously to prove just one of his crimes and convict or kill him br br Perhaps because it s a film in the same category as the marvelous Goodfellas 1990 and the first two Godfather films I was expecting too much from The General But that may be going too easy on it This would have been a bad film had I not seen the aforementioned masterpieces before being swamped by boredom in this oater and its far too stretched running time of screaming bad scenes Let s start knocking the film by just looking at the style in which it is presented For some reason director John Boorman and cinematographer Seamus Deasy selected to film this movie in black and white while its style and presentation are clearly the elements that belong to a full fledged color film Now I have nothing against b w pictures not even ones made in modern day times Schindler s List 1993 was more than ninety percent filmed in black and white and it s a masterpiece The General made just five years after Schindler s List is not The cinematography is also far too blown out with high lighting keys that seem very distracting and give the movie a very video game like quality that I found simply annoying The filmmakers were obviously going for a realist s documentary like style like Schindler s List did but they fail by making it seem too much like a documentary and at the same time too much like a classic style motion picture Performances in the film range from passable to poor Brendan Gleeson and Jon Voight gave decent enthusiasm for their roles but it seemed to me at times that even they were getting kind of run down by the awful screenplay from which they were quoting The sound design is also very primitive probably in an attempt to give it a 40s crime noir appeal but that also fails because again it s made too much like a contemporary picture and seems vastly out of place br br But the worst thing that occurs is that there s not one not one character in the film that I felt any emotions or opinions for In fact for every moment of every scene the only thought going through my head was okay so what Moments that in a better film might come across as shocking or appalling are just dull and time consuming here I did not sympathize or hate the Brendan Gleeson character because the way the Cahill character is written is simply flat and dull Gleeson just plays the common criminal and does not strike out with the impact the real Martin Cahill obviously did If a character is killed off as they always are in gangster films we feel nothing No remorse no relief no surprise nothing We just say so what And that s all I did during the entire running time of this very flimsy very poorly made crime film
Just had to write that one liner but it really is I love the gangster genre and this is the weakest entry I ve seen in recent years I have praises for everyone involved in most aspects except the most important one the script It is a weak story about a petty criminal No amount of fine acting or black and white film styling can make up for a total lack of substance I love Kevin Spacey and I hear he s gonna do another film about the general My advice is don t waste your time
John Boorman s 1998 The General was hailed as a major comeback though it s hard to see why on the evidence of the film itself One of three films made that year about famed Northern Irish criminal Martin Cahill alongside Ordinary Decent Criminal and Vicious Circles it has an abundance of incident and style the film was shot in colour but released in b w Scope in some territories but makes absolutely no impact and just goes on forever With a main character who threatens witnesses car bombs doctors causes a hundred people to lose their jobs tries to buy off the sexually abused daughter of one of his gang to keep out of jail and nails one of his own to a snooker table yet still remains a popular local legend an attractive enough personality for his wife to not only approve but actually suggest a ménage a trios with her sister it needs a charismatic central performance to sell the character and the film It doesn t get it Instead it s lumbered with what may well be Brendan Gleeson s worst and most disinterested performance he delivers his lines and stands in the right place but there s nothing to suggest either a local hero or the inner workings of a complex character On the plus side this helps not to overglamorize a character who is nothing more than an egotistical thug but it s at odds with a script that seems to be expecting us to love him and his antics br br There s a minor section that picks up interest when the IRA whips up a local hate campaign against the General and his men painting them as anti social drug dealers purely because Cahill won t share his loot from a robbery with them but its temporary resolution is so vaguely shot something to do with Cahill donning a balaclava and joining the protesters which we re expected to find lovably cheeky that it s just thrown away Things are more successful in the last third as the pressure mounts and his army falls apart but by then it s too late to really care Adrian Dunbar Maria Doyle Kennedy and the gorgeous Angeline Ball do good work in adoring supporting roles but Jon Voight s hammy Garda beat cop seems to be there more for American sales than moral balance overcompensating for Gleeson s comatose non involvement in what feels like a total misfire Come back Zardoz all is forgiven
What is most striking about this semi musical set in 1920s Berlin is the marvelous cinematography and editing It s top of the line from First National in these departments The story is mildly engaging and similar to the plots of Miller s other two films SUNNY SALLY where working girl is romanced by rich boy with family disapproval complications and final clinch All the four musical numbers are bunched at the beginning of the film and we go for a long stretch without any further musical buoyancy Miller sings parts of I THINK OF BABY and reprises BECAUSE OF YOU There are also DON T EVER BE BLUE and THOUGH YOU RE NOT THE FIRST ONE br br Miller here is very engaging and delightful quite reminiscent of Irene Dunne in manner and delivery Sad she does not dance as that is her forte SALLY remains her finest film with this trailing as second and the rather poor SUNNY a vastly inferior runner up Her life was tragically cut short by a sinus infection before the days when hospitals and antibiotics made such tragedies preventable It s worth visiting these films though to see Ziegfeld s top star of the twenties

I can t believe I wasted my time with this movie I couldn t even call it a movie It was so bad with nothing to recommend it br br I like low budget movies and weird flicks but this one had me bored to death Badly made and bad acting ruined it from being curious You have to wonder what these people were thinking when they spent money to produce this movie I wonder what I was thinking watching it to the end I recommend this movie to no one How did they release this Was there an audience who likes this kind of movie There must be because you can find this at almost any video store But why br br Deserves to be forgotten br br If you like bad movies then this is for you
Townies is the laziest movie I have ever seen and I saw the Blair Witch movies parts one and two It seems confused in what it wants to be It s not funny enough for comedy it s not tragic enough for drama it s not bloody enough for horror and it s not good enough for watching It has scenes of a man doing slapstick bloody karate so I think oh this movie will be in the vein of Toxic Avenger and Street Trash Then it leaps without warning into a drama about a missing girl a retarded mentally handicap woman and a trusting mother Then it slaps itself into the ONLY good part in the movie which seems to be set up like a sitcom without the laugh tracks The part I m speaking of is a lonely TOWNIE who is so lonely he finds comfort in a rotting corpse That was the ONLY part of the movie that gave me ANY feeling The rest was a waist of my life Then just to show how CRUEL Wayne is there is a kind of DOCUMENTARY at the end of the film of Wayne the Director making fun of Toby the star in public It made me sick Even though Killer Nerd and Bride of Killer Nerd two other movies by Wayne aren t the best they at least are thought out enough were you can stay entertained until the ending credits I even like Killer Nerd a bit it had some great lines I still use to this day br br If you like underground films if you like overground films and if you like to watch your feet just resting were they are you will not like TOWNIES br br 1 2 out of br br
The strange people living in a town go about their lives There s the licker a guy who licks everything a dumpster diver that finds a body which he takes home to live with him a crazy girl with a doll dressed like her a guy who wants to cleanse girls of their wicked ways offbeat in the extreme this shot in black and white movie is better with out the color The monochrome takes the edge off the two steps up from home movie feel Like a Troma movie this movie is fun in fits and starts but mostly its weird for weirds sake and soon becomes a crashing bore since one you see the set ups you can kind of guess where its going a lot of the time not always but enough for it not to be fun Though I didn t see the cleansing coming Worth a shot if you ve nothing else to watch and you re waiting for the next set of Golden Girls to come from Netflix
I ve been working my way through a collection of Lugosi films recently and having just been blown away a couple of days ago by the combination of Lugosi and Boris Karloff in The Black Cat I was really looking forward to seeing their collaboration in The Raven Alas it just didn t work for me and by the end of the film I was quite disappointed br br For the first three quarters of this movie or so I thought the story lacked any real suspense Lugosi was doing a pretty good job of holding things together as the somewhat mad Dr Vollins some sort of surgical genius who falls in love with a young woman Irene Ware he treats after a car accident but who can t have her partly because she s already engaged and partly because her father Samuel S Hinds disapproves To deal with that situation he enlists the aid of Edmond Bateman Boris Karloff a horribly ugly man who wants Vollins to make him look more acceptable Aside from Lugosi s performance though I found little to hold my interest Then suddenly in the last fifteen or twenty minutes the movie shifts around completely Suddenly it becomes quite suspenseful but I thought Lugosi s performance fell apart largely because the movie tried to shift him from mad to insane and there s a difference He plays the mad role very well controlled and in control but evil Insane is a more out of control evil and I didn t think Lugosi pulled that off well At one point he offers some maniacal laughter which just comes across as fake In the meantime Karloff was a huge disappointment He never grabbed me at all As an aside it must have grated on Lugosi that in movies in which they co star Karloff gets the top billing even though in The Raven it s clearly Lugosi who is the lead actor This surely gives a hint as to how Universal ranked their two great horror stars inexplicably I would add because I ve always thought of Lugosi as the better actor of the two br br In any event there s no real connection here to Edgar Allen Poe s story The Raven except that Vollins is a Poe fanatic who tries to recreate some of the torture techniques from Poe s stories Overall a disappointment 4 10
I m a Don Johnson fan but this is undoubtedly the WORST movie done by anybody that I ve ever seen The acting was bad as was the cinematography Don should stick to doing action because as The King he just didn t cut it
You may say to yourself Don Johnson as Elvis Can that work Is it possible Seems like an terrible choice to me but perhaps I should have an open mind Maybe I ll be surprised Maybe he can pull it off br br NOT br br Don Johnson is not a bad actor But he is an awful Elvis He s too short too weak voiced too sharply featured well you ve already imagined how bad he would be Add to that a hokey black wig and heavy handed eye liner and mascara and it s a big fat embarrassing mess br br The best I can say is that since Johnson s acting is decent and since his impersonation is so far off after a while you don t even think of him as Elvis anymore You see him as some other crazed pop star instead Then on that level the movie becomes watchable br br Stephanie Zimbalist is also not ideally cast as the tall beauty queen Linda Thompson But she is attractive in her own right and plays the part with the honesty elegance and intelligence we ve come to expect from all her roles There may be too much intelligence in her performance You have to be kind of a dope to stick with a dope abusing dope br br There s nothing new to this story we ve heard it many times before If you ve looking for new info or insight you won t find it It s told as a love story an unrequited one Linda for Elvis and Elvis for drugs
In 1972 after his wife left to go her own way Elvis Presley began dating Linda Thompson Miss Thompson a good humored long haired lovely statuesque beauty queen is charted to fill a void in Elvis life When Elvis divorce became final Linda was already in place as the legendary performer s live in girlfriend and travel companion until 1976 br br This is a gaudy look at their love affair and companionship Linda whole heartedly tending to her lover s needs and desires And even putting up with his swallowing medications by the handful and introducing her to her own love affair with valium At times this movie is harsh and dark of heart a very unattractive look at the King and his queen br br Don Johnson is absolutely awful as Elvis Over acting to the hilt is not attractive Stephanie Zimbalist lacks the classiness of Linda but does the job pretty well Supporting cast includes John Crawford Ruta Lee and Rick Lenz Watching this twice is more than enough for me but don t let this review stop you from checking it out For most Elvis fans that I have conferred with this is not a favored presentation
Previous commentator Steve Richmond stated that A Walk On The Moon is in his words not worth your 7 I ended up paying a bit more than that to import what is one of the worst quality DVDs I have yet seen of this film or any film in existence Even when you ignore the fact that the DVD is clearly sourced from an interlaced master and just plain nasty to watch in motion the film has no redeeming qualities save Anna s presence to make watching a top quality Blu Ray transfer worthwhile Not that this is any fault of the other actors Liev Schreiber Diane Lane Tovah Feldshuh and Viggo Mortensen all score high on the relative to Anna Paquin acting ability chart Far more so than Holly Hunter or Sam Neill did in spite of an equally lousy script anyway Director Tony Goldwyn s resume is nothing to crow about but Pamela Gray s resume includes Wes Craven s most dramatic excursions outside of the horror or slasher genre so one could be forgiven for thinking this is a case of bad direction br br As I have indicated already the sole reason I watched this film is Anna Paquin In her acting debut she literally acted veterans of the industry with a minimum of twelve years experience above hers under the table While she is not as far ahead of her castmates here her performance as a girl that starts the piece as a brat and grows into a woman whose world is crashing down around her proves her Oscar was no fluke For some time I have been stating to friends that she would be the best choice to portray the heroine of my second complete novel and a dialogue seventy three minutes into this film is yet another demonstration of why This woman could literally act the paint off walls Anna aside only Liev Schreiber comes close to eliciting any sympathy from an audience Sure his character spends the vast majority of the film neglecting a wife with an existential crisis but he plays the angered reaction of a man who feels cheated brilliantly I should know even if it is not from the same circumstances here br br Viggo Mortensen also deserves credit for his portrayal of a travelling salesman although perhaps not to the same extent In a manner of speaking he is the villain of the piece but he successfully gives the character a third dimension Yes his actions even after the whole thing explodes are underhanded but not many men would act any differently in his situation Nobody wants to be the other man in this kind of messed up situation so Viggo deserves a lot of credit for giving it a try here Unfortunately these are all participants in a story about a woman who feels trapped in a stagnant marriage where Tovah Feldshuh tells us that the Mills And Boon archetype of women being the only ones who feel life is passing by simply does not exist Either writer Pamela Gray or director Tony Goldwyn thought they could just put this line into the film without thinking of how the audience might receive it Anna even gets to speak the mind of the audience when she asks Diane who she is to be lecturing anyone about responsibility br br That said the film does have a couple of things besides Anna going for it Mason Daring s original music while not standing out in any way gives the film a certain feeling of being keyed into the time depicted that helps where the other elements do not Roger Ebert is right when he points out that while Liev is a great actor putting him alongside Viggo in the story of a woman forced to choose between her marriage and her fantasy is a big mistake He is also very correct in that when the film lingers over scenes of Lane and Mortensen skinny dipping or mounting one another under a waterfall it loses focus from being a story of a transgression and becomes soft porn The film seems terminally confused about the position of its story No matter how many times I rewatch Liev s scenes I cannot help but feel he has been shortchanged in the direction or editing One does not have to make their leads particularly handsome or beautiful but taking steps to make them the most interesting or developed characters in the piece would have gone a long way br br Ebert also hits the nail right on the head when he says that every time he saw Anna on the screen he thought her character was where the real story lay Stories about the wife feeling neglected and running into the arms of a man who seems interesting or even dangerous are a dime a dozen to such an extent now that even setting the story in parallel with an event as Earth shattering as the moon landing will not help In spite of feeling revulsion at the manner in which her character s story is presented Anna might as well be walking around with a neon sign above her head asking the audience if they would not prefer to see the whole thing through her eyes While I am all too aware that it is difficult to control exactly which character your audience will find the most interesting from your cast it is very much as if they did not bother to try with Lane and Schreiber Fans of these two would be well advised to look elsewhere Hopefully by now my ramblings about the respective performances will give some idea of where the whole thing went wrong br br I gave A Walk On The Moon a three out of ten Anna Paquin earns it a bonus point with one of her best performances and that is saying something
In what could have been an otherwise run of the mill mediocre film about infidelity in the sixties the subtle free love period the creators of this film pile on ridiculous scenario after ridiculous scenario and top it all off with a trite little cherry on top happily ever after ending At no time did I ever feel sympathy for Diane Lane or Anna Paquin in their troublesome middle class care free life nor did I feel for the emasculated Liev Shrieber The story line plods along slowly to its predictable pathetic conclusion and the only thing interesting and watchable about this film is the stunning Diane Lane topless Here s a hint it occurs about 30 minutes into the film Fast forward to that part and skip the rest
Tony Goldwyn is a good actor who evidently is trying his hand at directing A Walk on the Moon appears to have borrowed from other better made films The present story takes place in the late sixties at a summer resort for working class Jews not far from Woodstock The screen treatment by Pamela Gray doesn t have much going for it so it s a puzzle why Mr Goldwyn decided to tackle this film as his first attempt at direction br br The Kantrowitz family is spending some time at the resort We see them arrive at the small bungalow that is going to be their temporary home Marty the father comes only for the week end he works in what appears to be a family small appliance business repairing television sets mostly In a few days the first man will walk in space so the excitement is evident br br The Kantrowitz women are left behind Pearl Marty s wife and her mother in law Lilian spend idle days in the place until the blouse salesman arrives Pearl goes browsing and she finds much more than a shmatte she gets the salesman as well It appears that Pearl and Marty have no sexual life at all After two children Pearl who appears to be sexy and with a high libido is ready for some extra marital fun br br That is the basic premise for the film which becomes a soap opera when the young daughter Alison decides to play hooky and go to the Woodstock festival nearby where horror of horrors she witnesses her own mom making out with the blouse salesman What s a girl to do Well stay tuned for the grand finale when all the parties are happily reunited by the little son s bedside when he is stung by wasps and the salesman comes to apply some home remedy and daddy is called from the city after knowing about Pearl s betrayal with the younger stud br br Poor Diane Lane she went to make Unfaithful later on which is the upscale version of this dud Viggo Mortensen is the salesman who caters to his lonely female customers whispering little somethings in their ears Liev Schreiber as Marty the cuckolded husband doesn t have much to do Anna Paquin plays the rebellious Alison and Tovah Feldshuh is the unhappy Nana who would like to have stayed in the city watching her soap operas instead of witnessing first hand one that is playing in her own backyard br br Watch it at your risk or pop the DVD in the telly when you have a fun crowd at home and you really want to have a laugh or two dishing the film
Seeing as the world snooker championship final finished in a premature and disappointing manner with Ronnie O Sullivan defeating Greame Dott by 18 frames to 8 BBC 2 found a gap in their schedule and so decided to broadcast A WALK ON THE MOON a movie I had absolutely no knowledge off br br I missed a few seconds of the title credits so had no idea Viggo Mortensen starred in it and thought possibly it might be a cheap TVM certainly the opening with the mawkish Pearl and Marty taking their kids to a Summer camp has that sort of made for TV feel though the brightly lit Too brightly lit cinematography seemed to suggest this was a cinematic film and it wasn t until the appearence of Viggo Mortensen as hippy guy Walker that I realised this was a cinema release after all someone of Mortensen s stature wouldn t star in a TVM I mean that s like a legend like Robert DeNiro appearing in a straight to video film Wait a minute didn t Bob br br Some people on this site have mentioned that Pearl and Marty are an unconvincing on screen couple and I agree I can understand why Pearl would be attracted to exciting hippy guy but have no idea why Walker would be attracted to plain house wife Pearl The sixties was before my time but surely if you ve got the choice between hippy chicks and bored house wives it s not really a choice at all Mind you a lot of people took LSD in those days so I guess that explains it br br I feel the major problem of A WALK ON THE MOON comes down to the fact it s a romantic drama at heart Just like you d expect in a TVM with several cloying coming of age scenes so why include a fairly explicit sex scene It jars with the rest of the movie and is possibly off putting to the menopuasal women who were 20 something in 1969 I say possibly because the movie also seems to aim at a teeenage market with the coming of age scenes and those teenagers will probably be bored with the historical and social context of man walking on the moon and Woodstock In other words A WALK ON THE MOON tries to attract many types of audience but will probably appeal to none of them
Recently I had opportunity to view a working print in Kansas City Olathe KS of this title It is difficult for me being a lover of the art as I am to report the following but the truth sometimes hurts and quite frankly after sitting through this tripe I m using the slang definition here worthless statements or writing for an hour and a half I feel obligated to share WARN any interested parties Let s begin at the beginning a good place to start as always The first 15 minutes are not really that bad a couple of laughs and decent development but then it is downhill from there This is the story of a woman in her mid thirties that as the writer would like for you to believe is dissatisfied with her life and unfulfilled The first major difficulty occurs when if you don t know that fact going into the movie you won t know it when she suddenly risks it all for in my opinion a very unkempt and unlikely fling with a local salesman There is little development drastically insufficient development to justify her actions for the affair she has and when it occurs one feels as I did that she is just of low moral character The word slut comes to mind hopefully they ll let that pass the review and post the comment This in my opinion is the first fatal flaw of the film If you re married or have ever been in love irregardless of whether you are male or female its going to turn you off Quite frankly I feel that it would have made a much better blue movie that s the level in my opinion of which the screenplay is deserving The second fatal flaw is the casting Diane Lane just didn t work for me here and Viggo Mortensen is not the right man for the job believe me The only saving grace to the entire film is Anna Paquin the depth of her ability as a fine actress shines in places conveying a subtle yet very blunt I apologize for the dichotomy but it is accurate portrayal of an emerging teen Bravo well done I m not going to give the ending away but I was disappointed being billed as a slice of life romance is one thing but an ending like that Well if that teased you enough to see this picture don t say I didn t warn you but you better look fast if this celluloid is released I doubt it goes four weeks before bursting into flames I d say wait for the video but the free sex education tapes at most video rental outlets have more entertainment value Hmmm Dustin Hoffman produced this you think he d learn after Ishtar This film once carried the working title Blouse Man and should have been left on the rack If you ve never in your life wanted to walk out on a film give this one 35 40 minutes the only thing worth staying for is Anna Paquin if you can stomach the fact that you ll find your mind drifting to whether or not you took out the garbage before you left home which is probably where you should have stayed in the first place if you re off to the movies to see this one That s my two cents for what it is worth
Any movie that portrays the hard working responsible husband as the person who has to change because of bored cheating wife is an obvious result of 8 years of the Clinton era br br It s little wonder that this movie was written by a woman
Why do people who do not know what a particular time in the past was like feel the need to try to define that time for others Replace Woodstock with the Civil War and the Apollo moon landing with the Titanic sinking and you ve got as realistic a flick as this formulaic soap opera populated entirely by low life trash Is this what kids who were too young to be allowed to go to Woodstock and who failed grade school composition do I ll show those old meanies I ll put out my own movie and prove that you don t have to know nuttin about your topic to still make money Yeah we already know that The one thing watching this film did for me was to give me a little insight into underclass thinking The next time I see a slut in a bar who looks like Diane Lane I m running the other way It s child abuse to let parents that worthless raise kids It s audience abuse to simply stick Woodstock and the moonlanding into a flick as if that ipso facto means the film portrays 1969
Here again is yet another Diane Lane movie where she cheats on her husband Is this the only role she knows how to play This time it s set in 1969 and she cheats on her husband with the blouse man I am so not surprised because that is so very predictable Then her husband gets mad and throws the milk I wouldn t be surprised if she slept with the milkman as well I wouldn t be surprised if she slept with the ice cream man too because this is a very boring movie Then after some milk throwing she says sorry and sees the blouse man again Duh Then while she is making it with him her son gets stung by wasps My mom always told me not to throw rocks at a wasps nest This kids mom didn t have time to tell him that she was too busy with the blouse man
Sorry Fulci fans but I could not get through this one The soundtrack was about as annoying as they come the acting was puerile the story has been done and done and the direction was non existent br br Massacre honestly looked like a children s film project But I ve seen some of those and they actually look better than this did It appears to have been so underfunded they couldn t afford ANYTHING Not a DoP not a director no one who even remotely had a clue what acting was It was a very poor cinematic experience one of my worst br br This was about the worst suck fest I ve seen next to Terror Toons which is second only to Killer Klowns from Outer Space I ve nothing else to say about it br br It rates a 0 1 10 from br br the Fiend
In case half of this film s footage looks strangely familiar it means you watch way too much of this gory Italian cult crap For you see the notorious demigod Lucio Fulci did not only produce this movie he also took the liberty of re using the most sadistic killing sequences in his own and more easily traceable Cat in the Brain The opening scene already in which a prostitute is brutally decapitated with an axe features in Fulci s later film and so do another handful of killings and sleaze moments Andrea Bianchi s Masssacre fails miserably as a giallo since the search for the sadistic killer among a movie crew shooting a horror movie is all but compelling and suspenseful but it s still good entertainment if you re into cheap n shlocky horror trash The incoherent script introduces a whole bunch of repugnant characters who re all potential maniacs but none of the red herrings Biachi comes up with are plausible and you can point out the killer almost immediately Whatever remains to enjoy are the truly misogynous make up effects and the hilariously awful acting performances of the ensemble cast Whenever there isn t any bloodshed on screen like between the first and second murder Massacre is a slow and almost intolerable with its inane dialogs and thoroughly unexciting photography Thankfully in the second half there are women getting impaled on fences and males being stabbed repeatedly with rusty spikes The music is crap and the use of filming locations is very unimaginative My advise would be to skip this puppy and go straight for the aforementioned Cat in the Brain That one features ALL the great moments of Massacre and then some
Prior to this film I had only seen two films by director Andrea Bianchi the trashy zombie flick Le Notti del Terrore 1981 famous amongst horror fans for its unforgettable performance from man child Peter Bark and the enjoyably sleazy giallo Strip Nude For Your Killer Neither film was a particularly spectacular piece of cinema but both were entertaining in their own special way and the fact that they featured plenty of gore and nudity didn t hurt Massacre however is dull dull dull despite quite a bit of splatter and the odd spot of gratuitous bare flesh br br The story about a series of murders in a hotel where the cast and crew of a horror film are residing during their shoot is confusing and oh so boring when the blood isn t flowing and the skin isn t on show the film is a real struggle to sit through it took me four attempts to finish with endless scenes of unlikeable characters bickering among themselves and doing very little of note br br The only point of interest about the film is that its producer Lucio Fulci used several of its death scenes to pad out his mega gory movie Cat In The Brain AKA Nightmare Concert And if you ve already seen that film then there is very little reason to bother with Massacre
Massacre is a film directed by Andrea Bianchi Burial Ground and produced by legendary Italian horror director Lucio Fulci Now with this mix of great talent you would think this movie would have been a true gore fest This could not be further from that Massacre falls right on its face as being one of the most boring slasher films I have seen come out of Italian cinema I was actually struggling to stay awake during the film and I have never had that problem with Italian horror films br br Massacre starts out with a hooker being slaughtered on the side of the road with an ax This scene was used in Fulci s Nightmare Concert This isn t a bad scene and it raises your expectations of the movie as being an ax wielding slaughter Unfortuanitly the next hour of the movie is SO boring The movie goes on to a set of a horror film being filmed and there is a lot of character development during all these scenes but the characters in the movie are so dull and badly acted your interest starts to leak away The last 30 minutes of the movie aren t so bad but still could have been much better The gore in the movie was pathetic and since Fulci used most of the gore scenes in Nightmare Concert there was nothing new here The end of the movie did leave a nice twist but there was still to much unanswered and the continuity falls right through the floor br br This wasn t a very good film but for a true Italian horror freak like myself this movie is a must have since it is very rare 4 10 stars
Kevin Spacey is very talented but unfortunately directing is not his forte I had high expectations about the film before I rented it and maybe that is why I disliked it so much I admire Spacey s attempt at making a film that takes place mostly in one small setting but it s not the attempt that counts I found the film dull boring and stretched out The acting was nothing spectacular Gary Sinise has done much better especially since he is conscious in most of his other films Skeet Ulrich was disappointing but this was one of his first films I did get a kick out of how young and chubby this Scream star looked The only thing that impressed me about this film was the one shot of the car wreck from above The center line of the road was perfectly centered and the camera moved on along the line and past the wreck However that shot was very Usual Suspects ish and my guess is Spacey got the idea from that earlier film of his which is very good mind you If you want to see a fabulous film that takes place in one small setting watch Hitchcock s Lifeboat Maybe Spacey should have watched it before filming this
A trio of low life criminals led by Matt Dillon botches a late night burglary They flee but quickly cross paths with the police who just happen to be in hot pursuit of a terrorist Of course the police mistake the burglar gang for the terrorist the real terrorist gets away and the burglars are forced to take refuge in a small dive of a bar taking hostages unaware why the police are so intent on catching them And guess who else has picked the bar as a sanctuary for the night br br Unbelievable Absolutely And it goes down hill from there Spacey did acquire a good bit of acting talent Matt Dillon Faye Dunaway Gary Sinise Viggo Mortensen and M Emmett Walsh but they re all wasted Mostly because after all the characters get stuck in the bar all they do for the remainder of the film is argue Endlessly and aimlessly Long before the conclusion of the film you ve stopped giving a damn about what happens to them
by Dane Youssef br br A gang of crooks The perfect plan It all goes wrong They re in trouble The police are outside They re cornered What are they gonna do now br br Sound familiar br br The movie seems like it s trying to be a combination of the acting workshop the indie film and the theater br br It s the kind of things that actors love it s kind of like a workshop or a play because it mostly consists of tight focusing on the actors acting acting angry tense scared conversing scheming planning giving the performers a lot of free range to really ham it all up br br A trio of crooks one leader one goon one brother come up with a big heist scheme and a monkey wrench is thrown into the works To top things off there s a bit of a fender bender and one of the crooks in flung through the back of the windshield br br The cops are on their tail and they stumble into a bar named poetically and leadenly Dino s Last Chance br br Spacey as a director tries to keep the focus on the actors performances and delivery of dialouge He pans over to a bright passion red cigarette ad of a smoking and smoldering Bogart And he keeps all the violence off screen really br br I think that was a mistake Focusing on the intensity and gruesome violent scenes would have given the movie some edge br br The problem with the movie is that it moves too slow and suffers from miscasting in almost every role Matt Dillon Drugstore Cowboy and Wild Things seems too young and too idealistic to be the leader of this gang br br Gary Sinese seems to brooding and deep in thought to be a spineless tag along with these guys and Joe Mantaga is effective as the traditional routine foul swearing mad dog police lieutenant who s all thumbs but he isn t given anything to really do here br br William Fischter is the only actor who is believable in his role as a brainless grunt who just wants to spill blood br br And the crooks are in a tense situation where they either go to jail or they try to think of some way out of this br br Spacey lacks the ability to create a lot of tension and keep it going The characters are mostly chatting away trying to think of a plan and they re to calm and too articulate There s even a scene where the crooks are playing pool with a whole swarm of armed cops right outside ready to strike At one point one of the crooks even call the police who are right outside the bar Oh brother Oh bother br br These cops are going to either blow them away or going to lock them up Shouldn t the holed up crooks be a little scared a little uneasy Meanwhile all the real action is happening inside br br Someone whips out a gun a baseball bat which leads to an ugly confrontation off screen and there s one more casualty that happens that s well kinda sad But br br Faye Dunaway also should have spent more time with a dialect coach improving on her New Orleans accent Skeet Ullrich is fine in a smaller part br br A cop listening in reaches for a pack of matches at the absolute worst time is a nice look And so is a scene where someone goes right through the rear windshield br br The dialouge is obviously trying to go for a David Mamet approach and it s as profane but never as realistic or as insightful br br The movie feels like too much of what it really is a really low budget movie with an actor behind the camera for the first time directing other actors from a script that s not bad but needs a few more re writes Spacey shows he s not a terrible director but he lacks a sort of feel for shaping a movie and it feels like he s just filming actors act br br These actors are all talented and could work with the material but they all feel out of place As I said before the movie really suffers from miscasting br br I don t mean that the wrong actors were cast I think they found just the right cast but placed them in all the wrong roles I think switching some of the roles would ve helped immensely br br Having veteran mob actor Joe Mantagna play the leader of the pack Gary Sinese as the angry police lieutenant outside on his bullhorn giving orders and barking at his troops keeping Fischter in his bloodthirsty goon part and Matt Dillion as the sacrificial lamb That would have been a big improvement br br When some actors direct it works They can even win Oscars for it But a lot of the time when actors direct they have a tendency to just focus on the performances Just shoot the actors acting br br Sometimes it works but they need a good showcase for it An excuse for it br br Hostage situations are all pretty much the same in real life just like coming of age stories so it s only natural that movies about them will go from point A to point B as well br br There are a few really great entries into this genre Spacey himself appeared in a similar movie about hostage situations The Negotiator br br This certainly won t become a cult classic let alone one of AFI s 100 Still it does have a few nice moments and personal touches but in the end it s instantly forgettable and the kind of movie that would play best on regular TV It s just not worth going out of your way to see br br I give a 3 out of 10 br br Spacey s other directorial credit Beyond The Sea was reportedly a better effort Hmmm maybe it s true You need to fail before you succeed br br by Dane Youssef
On the face of it this should be a great film a great cast a plot with many possibilities and one of Hollywood s finest behind the camera for the first time br br However its clear why it was another 8 years before spacey decided to try directing a movie again This movie fails on so many levels In a film where there is not much action and most of the scenes are shot in a couple of locations it is imperative that suspense and continuity are provided by the director Not so here the great cast is horribly under used none more so than the great late John Spencer the plot is so run of the mill and nothing you haven t seen in a hundred other TV movies There is so little character development you end up not caring for any of the protagonists At least we know spacey has a lot of mates and clout in Hollywood studios to get away with a poor flick like this
Although it has been 2 years I still remember the complete waste that comprises the entire plot of the movie Unfortunately I came across this movie after my friends and I selected it while browsing through the new releases at Blockbuster We decided to pick the movie because it was the only one we all had not seen and it sounded like it may be enjoyable Although it has been quite some time since I viewed the movie I still remember the lack of plot seriously there is no true plot and complete waste of time that was spent watching the movie If you are in the video store and this film catches your eye walk on and find a better movie If you did end up seeing this movie I understand your pain
I saw this movie on t v this afternoon and I can t see how anyone can sit through this piece of trash It s not funny at all and it takes your I Q down a few notches I know this movie is for kids but that doesn t mean the writers should take their intelligence for granted I bet that writers were sitting around a large wooden table and figured that a The word poop equals big laugh b A four foot tall kid can dunk on a ten foot tall basketball net c Kids should always fight kidnappers armed with guns because the kidnappers will fall for anything and d 3 months of karate training is all you need to beat up so called ninjas with swords One good thing I can say about this movie is it contains the weakest suburban gang in the world that couldn t scare anybody Maybe the guys at MST3K could use this movie for a good laugh Don t bother with this lame ass excuse for a movie
Oh my god This movie insults the intelligence of everybody I mean really who thinks three kids can fight 30 to 40 ninjas and win Not to mention the brainless humor thrown in This film is baaaaaaaaaaaaaad The movie is an omen the only thing it s good for is a time killer or unintentional laughs
Serious HOME ALONE KARATE KID knock off with enough bad character stereotypes to have the writer sued and then shot You could see blatant stunt man usage in almost every scene Oh and the acting sucks too Although I must say that the line Sorry dude I have to take a major dump big time made me laugh my ass off
I remember when this came out a lot of kids were nuts about it I guess I was a bit too old to get all excited and I was a fan of real martial arts films and always found this a bit cheesy br br In the early 90 s we were swamped with programs such as this making kids feel like they could fight and be a power ranger or an equal to these kids on 3 Ninjas I think eventually parents and film makers alike got sick of it because all we had in reality was abunch of kids going around punching and hitting everyone br br Many kids movies have some big point they re trying to make and its nice for your kids to watch and get the message this one doesn t have any message at all it just exploits a million difference things in less than 90 minutes br br The movie has no great visual qualities but would one expect it to The acting is pretty bad Victor Wong is a cool actor but it was embarrassing to see him here The short fat gimped eyed old fart as a powerful ninja that was just hilarious The kids over acted way too much and the youngest ninja Tum Tum was maybe the worst kid actor I have ever seen br br The movie has a plot that anyone knows before they even read the review 3 ninjas yea you know they re gonna fight a bunch of bad guys and win obviously Need I say more Sorry if I spoiled it for anyone br br With all that said KIDS WILL LOVE IT This movie is aimed at kids and only children could enjoy it If you don t mind your kid seeing movies about kids fighting this is a good movie to let them see If you don t mind allowing your children to see complete garbage that has nothing to do with real martial arts real acting or reality period then you have found a movie for your kids I say kids because I think even the girls will like it I recall all the girls having a crush on Rocky br br 2 out of 10 stars because I think you can make a movie for kids and still make it enjoyable for adults this movie failed big time at that It is beyond cheesy and nothing original or unique and I would not allow a child of mine to watch it Kung Fu the TV series is on DVD and there s tons of great Shaw Brothers films out there Why not show your children things that will really entertain them and not make them dumb along the way perhaps even teach them some moves and not just how to kick a man between the legs as grandpa did on 3 Ninjas no no no never kick a man between the legs never thats so unninja like
Mimicking its long title the movie finds ways to come close to the 90 mark The beautiful sets are here with all that made the Hamer production values a trademark yet Paris drowned in the fog is a sign of indolent neglect The story is obvious and can be summed up in a dozen words so there comes nothing unexpected and nothing worth more than 5 of your attention to be expected br br The directing is heavy as a direct transfer from the stage play actors are mostly stiff as wax figures ok this is a Hamer feature only it s sometimes better featured in the whole package My conclusion this movie is trash not worth the time I spend that evening Eternal life is a boring matter and I should have hoped the guys in charge of programming at the Cinemathèque would have known better

First a little summary This reporter named Torch is basically trying to get out the story of a zombie outbreak and finds the military government censoring him Nice message government censorship and all that but the way they DID the movie was well let me explain br br This movie is beyond description The idea that somebody holds it in higher regard than anything by George Romero is justification enough for the reviewer to be committed to a mental institution The script is atrocious on its own like it was written by a sixth grader As for special effects I understand that independent films have low budgets and some gore effects looked acceptable but if you want a scene with fire here s a tip buy some nonflammable material have an extinguisher ready and get a fire going Don t digitally add it in and make it look like an explosion from a Nintendo 64 game The acting well let s put it this way In my summer theater program a cold reading of the script is compared to this The Godfather I won t even go into the inconsistencies Find them yourself br br What disturbed me the most though was when everything was finished after shooting and editing somebody might have said Okay this looks good Let s release it It sends a chill down my spine to even think about it to think somebody felt that this was good enough for DVD release This isn t DVD quality This isn t Sci Fi channel quality Hell this isn t even film school quality If you were to submit this in for a project at a film school you would get an F No not even an F more like an F I wouldn t be surprised if he would try to get you expelled br br I felt used after I saw this thing Blockbuster and the makers of this movie have my money right now and I d prefer not to think of what they re doing with it I have been the pawn of some elaborate nefarious scheme at legalized theft and it doesn t feel good to think that I walked right into it looking at the back cover with pleasant memories of 28 Days Later only to find a film Ed Wood would watch and say afterwards I didn t much care for this This film is the single most terrible movie I have seen I have not seen anything by Ed Wood but I have confidence this is worse If you are looking for serious cinema so much as being within ten feet of it will probably give you a bad headache If not I still recommend that you personally write the director and ask how he sleeps at night However if you are the kind of person who get a laugh out of really bad stuff then I recommend you check this out You won t be disappointed
Although nothing can compare to Vampires Vs Zombies in any realm of film making i will attempt to judge this movie br br Firstly the special effects were breath taking When there was an explosion on the television screen i thought my entire house was going to explode and when automatic machine guns were fired i thought the shells were landing on the floor right next to me Simply stunning my friends br br But the scene when the Jack Black sound a like is giving the worst monologue i have ever heard i nearly killed myself but don t worry since he was getting blazed in the movie he can pass his awful acting off on I must be high Seriously he must have watched himself mindlessly babbling about non congruent thoughts that make absolutely no sense and just added that he must be high to justify his awful acting Well if you can say that to excuse terrible acting then if you talked to the writers directors executive producers sponsors you will probably get the same response seriously br br With a production team called Shock o rama i was shocked i didn t place a sawed off shotgun in my mouth and ended my life after this shockingly terrible excuse for a movie was played br br If you want to see this movie then you should be murdered br br Yours Truly br br The General
As you may have gathered from the title I wholeheartedly believe this movie to be the worst zombie movie of all time The acting camera work writing special effects and anything else remotely related to this movie sucked People have argued that while this movie is terribly acted and terribly produced but it comes through with a witty intelligent script Wow The plot has more holes than I or anyone else could possibly count For starters why would the government tell everyone to go back to work when it s not safe I know the government s supposed to be evil but they don t gain anything by killing the entire population of the country There wouldn t be anyone to govern Another thing that I was wondering about even if the government told everyone to go to work why would people go if the streets were swarming with zombies Were the zombies going to hide in the bushes and ambush the unsuspecting people in order to aid the government in their plot to kill everyone on the planet And how about the ending That stupid Torch guy sacrifices his life in order to get a few close up shots of the zombies He probably forgot that every camera made in the last 35 years has a zoom feature And another thing why does he say Hindenburg before he dies The Hindenburg was a rare event seen by a very few people The zombie menace will been seen by everyone in the country possibly the world He doesn t think anyone else will get a few snapshots They also managed to ruin the only semi interesting scene in the film when the soldier is watching the exotic dancer Why did the zombie hide behind a curtain for five minutes before attacking the girl Especially when the zombie could have come through the DOOR It s probably just something an unintelligent zombie movie fan such as myself wouldn t understand Every day I pray that God with increase my brain capacity long enough for me to figure out all the subtle nuances in Feeding the Masses br br Anywho I think it s interesting that this is the first movie that gave me the desire to physically hurt the people involved in the production Hey Trent Haaga I m calling you out
This apocalyptic zombie film tries to be vicious and shocking but FEEDING THE MASSES comes off lame as some of the stiff legged zombies stalking the streets In Rhode Island a zombie epidemic known as the Lazarus Virus is being played down by the government manipulated newspapers and television stations A couple of brave but dumb souls at Channel 5 TV News feels its audience is being given false hope and no idea of the real danger at hand An eager reporter Racheal Morris and her cameraman William Garberina with the aid of a military escort Patrick Cohen risk life and limb to present a live broadcast to show the doom at hand Do yourself a favor and don t watch This thing is obviously very low budget and comes across with the feel of a high school play gone bad Acting is atrocious and the flesh hungry zombies are almost comical Also appearing are Michael Propster William DeCoff and Brenda Hogan FEEDING THE MASSES should be left to starve
This is perhaps the worst attempt at a Zombie film I have ever had the misfortune to see Terrible terrible terrible Any review found on this site is obviously the work of either the filmmaker the filmmakers family or a friend of the filmmaker How does this film suck Let us count the ways br br The plot Incoherent Dialogue Atrocious I will not slam the effects gore as I understand that this is low budget But was there even one zombie that was not obese C mon And for a film set in Rhode Island why did that truck sport a Massachusetts plate Continuity find some br br The Girl dancing while the soldier Stands at attention Please don t put your ex girlfriend or buddy s sister in your movie naked This was an ugly movie filled with ugly people and has no business even mentioning Romero on the cover Next time you decide to make a movie don t
Honestly who in God s name gave this movie an 8 1 rating I guess the people who actually made or starred in the movie were the ones who voted Otherwise this movie sucks This movie is nothing more than an amateur or possibly student film I m a movie fanatic and have seen terrible movies but there was literally nothing redeeming here The story and acting was the worst I ve ever seen The props including the use of toy airsoft guns with terrible special effects where just as bad as everything else I m all for bad language in movies but the F Bomb was dropped about every third word and I think we might have a winner for the most use of the F Bomb in any movie EVER The movie also appears to have been filmed using cheap video cameras and not actual film I d expect this to get awards for an amateur movie shown only on public access stations around the country but it doesn t belong on a DVD br br Do not buy this movie Do not rent this movie All I can say was that this was a terrible waste of a free movie rental coupon This is valuable time that you will NEVER get back Unfortunately for me that time is lost but it s not too late for you If you decide to rent this movie consider this my warning
Set in Providence Rhode Island Feeding the Masses tries to be a satiric look at the role of the media in government At best it could be applied to how the US try to control media during the Iraq War but it ends up feeling hollow There s never any really tension in the story and the acting never very good Worst the direction of the movie is atrocious focus more on odd camera angles that fail to convey anything beyond Isn t this an odd way to hold the camera Special effects are pretty bad at one point video of an explosion is green screened over the city and it s laughable at best br br The film does have a couple bright spots namely the advertisements for post zombie services including a reclamation service and a party bus But it s far too little to make the film worthwhile br br For a better zombie film try Hide and Creep It has the same weak production value but there s much more wit humor and talent behind it
Feeding the Masses is just one of many recent mediocre zombie movies to be after your hard earned dollars Suggestion Keep your hard earned dollars and let s just say that good old TheatreX took one for the team on this one Guess what the plots about Zombies taking over This time though for the sake of originality this film takes place in Rhode Island and to be honest I m not sure I ve ever seen a zombie flick based in Rhode Island A TV station controlled by the government is supposedly keeping up normal broadcasts so that any remaining citizens won t think that there s any problem in the world that is those that never look or go outside anyway I will say though that a few of the commercials broadcast by this station were probably the most amusing part of this film There is actually somewhat of a story to this but I m not bothering with that because after a while you ll either not care or have fallen asleep At any rate this has plenty of terrible acting to throw on top off all the seen it all before stuff that gets trotted out before the camera Trust me you can find plenty of other things to do with your time than watch this 3 out of 10
this is quite possibly the worst acting i have ever seen in a movie ever and what is up with the casting the leading lady in this movie has some kind of nose dis figuration and is almost impossible to look at for any period of time without becoming fixated on her nose you could go to your local grocery store on a Sunday afternoon and easily find 50 more qualified better looking possible leading ladies i made the unfortunate mistake of renting this movie because it had a cool DVD case This movie looks like it is just some class project for a group of multimedia students at a local technical college i would rather have spent the hour or so that this movie was on watching public access television at least the special effects are better and the people on there are more attractive than anyone you will see in this film
Some news reporters and their military escorts try to tell the truth about a epidemic of zombies despite the government controlling the media The makings of the film don t understand that the George Romero zombie films only worked because he kept his politics subtly in the background of most of his films Land of the Dead withstanding This satire is about as subtle as a brick to the face or a bullet to the head is more apropos for this scenario What s subversive or subtle about seeing a military guy masturbating to death and destruction Anything nuanced about the various commercials that are inter cut with the film Nope Furthermore the acting is uniformly horrible the characters thoroughly unlikable and the plot inane Add this all up and you have the worst most incompetent zombie film since C H U D 2 reared it s hideous head br br My Grade D
Feeding The Masses was just another movie trying to make a little money off of the zombie craze that is going around mostly due to the popularity of movies such as Land Of The Dead and the Resident Evil series br br It starts at a television station which is guarded by the military and are reporting that The Lazarus Virus zombies are close to containment and the city will soon be free to do their business again The problem is this is totally false Zombies are running rampantly and only a small minority of people are aware Among them are Torch William Garberina the camera man Sherry Rachael Morris the lead anchor woman who for some reason is listed as playing Shelly on this website and Roger Patrick Cohen their military escort Torch and Sherry are against lying to the people but the station is being run by secret service or some other government agency and they are heavily censored br br This movie gives itself a pat on the back on the box cover saying We hold FEEDING THE MASSES on a higher level than any o the three of the Dead films by George A Rombero The source of that quote has lost ALL credibility with me br br Let me just say that this movie is BAD I don t mean bad like I was expecting more I obviously was though but I mean bad in that I could not find any redeeming qualities in the film whatsoever The acting in all parts are either over done or too wooden Did anybody remember their lines or are they reading off of cue cards I can t even think of what the best part of the movie was or the best actor actress There really was not one If I had to give a nod to someone I would say Roger the military escort was probably the most interesting character but that is really not saying much br br I would have to recommend to pass on this movie despite the box cover looking pretty good It s what originally drew me to the movie 3 10
You know how everyone jokes about the acting in porno movies Well if you ve always found the plot line of a porn to captivate your interest then this movie is for you It truly was like a porn without the sex Or if that analogy is not to your liking imagine you and your drunk roommate found a movie camera abandoned on a park bench This is the movie that you would make Horrible acting bad camera work Music done on a casio keyboard This movie has it all and more For those who are masochists in the crowd this is a premiere piece for your collection br br All I can figure is that the only people to submit reviews for this dripping pile of movie were people who starred in it br br Their movie career is over before it started
If this movie was written directed and produced with the intention of creating a bad movie cult classic it might i say might have been a hit Have you ever sat and watched a movie that was so absolutely awful that it becomes fascinating in terms of its faults Well this is it Every one of the acting cast should be nominated for worst acting performance awards It would be hard to find another film with this kind of production budget that contains so little of any value whatsoever The whole thing from the opening scenes defies logic Dialogue is completely unbelievable and illogical Ditto for the behaviour and general storyline of the film itself What is really mind boggling is that some buffoons in a boardroom actually made decisions to spend money on this piece of trash Wow

I couldn t believe this terrible movie was actually made at all With the worst actors you could find the worst script written Mark Frost Sollace Mitchell and by far the worst waste of time in viewing I won t belabor the story as it s really not worth it But I will elaborate on some of the performances and definitely the story As to the story it is very hard to believe that this bitty crazy schemer could actually do what she did That in reality the wife couldn t defend herself against a little bitty of a thing That the husband could actually find the nut case attractive at all That the defense attorney could break every court rule there was and keep on doing it after the judge ordered the blankety blank to shut up And the final result of the film is an insult to justice movie codes and the male species The theme of this mess is let women do as they wish kill whom they want defend the killer and get away with it while the guy rots in jail the innocent victim Hard to believe that Sollace Mitchell the director and a man would even want to make this dribble br br As to the acting Jordan Ladd the killer is awful A loony toons who does needlepoint during her murder trial is this allowed in court She bored me to the hilt One more look of her batting her eyes and indicating how innocent she was and I d throw up She s not even attractive enough for any guy to leave his wife The husband played on one level by Vincent Spano just seems to look and act stupid most of the time He was so predictable in his performance falling into the traps set for him by all the women surrounding him The worst by far was Holland Taylor as the Defense Attourney She over acted throughout the film and made a mockery of justice If she would cross examine me anytime I d have told her to go take a hike Everybody else in this sleazy film did their job as directed to do so br br I wish I could give this film a zero rating However we are forced to start with 1 Too bad Let s not have anymore painful watching films like this Lifetime can do better then this I know it br br This is a postscript Made the mistake of turning this insipid movie on by mistake As soon as I saw the bimbo Jordan Ladd I knew I d seen it before and didn t like it or her I not only turned the darn thing off but had to add my anger at people like Sollace Mitchell who wrote the screenplay but also directed this horrible flick Doesen t anyone see that her his message is that sickness pays Being ill and going around killing people is okay with this director writer Totally making the male species idiots Well this male tells you to go stuff it somewhere painful We re not all that stupid and will speak out to your so called movie which in this person s mind deserves to be trashed br br And again this loser is shown Why Can t you read the comments on this stupid and despicable movie Are we constantly subjected to see the bimbo Jordan Ladd again and again Get her off TV films and out of sight She s just terrible in every sense of the word Phew
may seem far fetched but there really was a real life story of a man who had an affair with a woman who found out where he and his new wife were staying and she killed the wife making it look like a murder rape br br in her delusion she had told everyone that the man had asked her to marry him so she quit her job in Wisconsin and moved to Minnesota br br last I heard she was in a mental institution Security Prison br br she was still wearing the engagement ring that she has purchased for herself and had told everyone that he had bought it for her br br The events took place in a small town in Wisconsin and the murder happened in Minnesota br br There even was a feature story in People magazine Spring of 1988 I want to say on Page 39 I remember this as I was in college at the time and a colleague of mine had met the individual in the Security Hospital
i can t believe i actually watched this but i guess i just wanted to know if this movie would get unintentionally funnier and funnier towards the end and it did the climax was the poorest performance ever given by the defence lawyer so out of real life that even for a fictional story it was far too weird no way anyone on this planet can behave in front of a court like she did and probably the worst prosecutor on earth why was he in court anyway he did nothing and absolutely nothing to prove her guilty a simple search of her house would have resulted in the find of the rings but no go he preferred to say objection 2 or 3 times during the whole trial that was it the blonde lunatic was given a truth drug to prove her innocent but not Brett the lunatic almost had an altar of Brett in her home that could have proved her sick obsession but again no go during the court scene i felt the silent urge to take the needlepoint out of her hand and bang it several times against her head even real weirdos do not look that silly fake i am innocent like she did and what does this movie tell us never marry a woman with a life insurance as soon as she falls down the stairs her husband will be thrown into jail guilty or not evil evil men
I happened upon this flick on a rainy Sunday intending to tune in to something else Out of curiosity I accessed the comments here and found myself watching it to the end I really didn t do so with intent this was one of those movies where you re fascinated and watch it for another couple of minutes until you finally just watch to the end And the indictment of it in most of these comments made it more fascinating to view The one comment where the person really liked it seems to be solely as a result of liking Ladd and Spano and their earlier roles But great isn t anywhere to be found anywhere here story performances and particularly the absurd courtroom hi jinks We all know that Perry Mason before Raymond Burr passed the 300 lb mark and Ben Matlock are granted some leeway in cavorting around the courtroom instead of being boringly confined to a lectern And Matlock is especially granted the privilege of entering exhibits often by simply going to the jury and showing them before the judge and prosecutor have even been informed of or shown them No real life judge or prosecutor would stand for this br br Both Perry and Ben almost always ended the proceedings by wringing a confession of the real killer Actually Perry nearly always did this but often Matlock would simply present overwhelming evidence of the true culprit pronounce it reasonable doubt and then leave it to the cops and prosecutors to proceed against the guilty party sometimes on camera sometimes presumed at the end of the show br br But that said Holland Taylor s histrionics and the amount of leeway afforded her in the courtroom portion of this story made the actions of Matlock Mason more closely resemble the slow often boring detail such as seen on Court TV and in real life courtrooms br br Every character in this presentation was either insipid unsympathetic obnoxious boring improbable or some combination of two or more of these br br The ending was the most banal absurd even silly conclusion possible but again fascinating because of this Ladd and Spano are attractive individuals and t v movies would appear their best forte probably best in 2nd lead probably better if 3rd roles even in this venue Taylor could be cast as the aunt or mother of one of them Give this one 1 star for the story performances and 3 additional for the fascination factor
The Deadly Look of Love is essentially Fatal Attraction with a couple of twists added onto the back half The ending will not surprise anyone who has seen more than two or three Movies of the Week It is yet another cautionary tale about succumbing to temptation and it adds nothing fresh to the genre br br Brett Vincent Spano is engaged to a beautiful woman who just happens to have a sizable trust fund Even though he has it all he risks losing everything by starting up a steamy side affair with Janet Jordan Ladd Janet a doe eyed blonde from Cedar Falls falls hard for Brett and she does not take it particularly well when he comes clean about his engagement Shortly after the wedding Mrs Brett turns up dead in the master bedroom of the large luxurious home she shared with her new husband When the police question Brett he promptly points the finger at Janet Following her arrest Janet seems to get loonier by the minute not that she was the picture of stability before Her defense attorney Holland Taylor is convinced that Janet is innocent and is hell bent on proving it br br Did she do it or didn t she How will it end You can find out the answers to these questions the next time The Deadly Look of Love airs on your local station And be sure not to miss the moral of this beautiful story men are pigs and women are crazy
This is not horror as the first part was This is campy light and humorous entertainment Like in so many sequels the action starts right away with no explanations But there s boobs so I don t complain And real boobs that is If I understand correctly those are quite rare today amongst the teenage girls in U S of A Which brings to my mind the fact that the main actress here is Pamela Bruce s sister Springsteen br br This cannot be thought without the first movie so I compare this to it Again there is too small clothing mainly pants and funny hair it s not hard to tell what decade this film is made in Again there is really strange characters this time even more visibly pathological ones Especially the personnel of the camp It s like some mental rehabilitation summer camp People are older Most of the actors must be at least 25 but I think they re supposed to be 16 or something Some methods used by the Evil Dyke are quite unpleasant Actually this movie don t have much in common with the first part and this is worse than it in every way
Absolutely putrid slasher film has not one redeeming quality It has Camp Councellor Angela Pamela Anderson awful as the killer her quips when she wastes people aren t even amusing on the warpath slaying teenagers who act the least bit naughty or resist her pleadings for good behavior We run the gamut of boring clichéd killings such as the slashing to the throat to one kid looking for his Freddy clawed glove a kid who gets a chainsaw one girl who gets drilled one who gets shoved into the crapper filled with leeches one who is roasted etc br br It doesn t have one original idea to offer and is merely a waste of time That is unless you want to see Valerie Hartmen s who plays the slut Ally tits Most of the violence occurs off screen so even that will not satisfy
this movie is not good the first one almost sucked but had that unreal ending to make it worth watching this one has nothing there s zero scare zero tension or suspense this isn t really a horror movie most of the kills don t show anything there s no gore to speak of this could almost be a TV except for a bit of nudity and a bit of violence the acting is not very good either and don t get me started on the dialogue as for the surprise ending surprise there isn t one i suppose it could have been worse although i don t see how but then again it is less than 80 minutes long so i guess that s a good thing although it felt a lot longer apparently this is the cut version of the film i found it for a very cheap price but it still not worth it if you want the uncut more graphic version check out the Anchor Bay edition anyway this version of Sleepaway Camp II Unhappy Campers gets a big fat 1 10 from me p s if you watch this movie you will probably be a bored and unhappy camper if you are a real fan you might want to pick up Anchor Bay s Sleepaway Camp with survival kit three disc collection containing the first three movies uncut and with special features
So Angela has grown up and gotten therapy and an operation to turn her into a real life daughter rather than the son that she was born and now holds a job as wait for it a camp counselor How appropriate right I know I love it Anyway the first sequel to the Sleepaway Camp franchise obeys all the rules of horror sequels more blood more imaginative killings which aren t imaginative but still more so than the original more nudity a more elaborate plot and generally worse than the original br br It is entertaining in the same way as the original was in that the characters and wardrobes are so goofy and so authentically 80 s that you can t help getting a good laugh At one point a guy asks Angela out and she says I ll call you and then quickly walks away The guy says to himself How is she gonna call me I don t have a phone and then he sniffs his armpits wondering what turned her off it s the hair dude br br It is a well known fact that in 80s slasher movies the murdered teenagers were more often than not being punished by their killer for some kind of bad behavior usually for being too promiscuous When I first started getting into horror movies and saw the Friday the 13th movies for the first time in the mid 90s I didn t realize this I learned it in a film class a year or two later and was amazed that their was some method to the madness I was pretty impressed not only that the movies were passing on some kind of message albeit a morbid one but that there was actually some thought put into it br br But not in this movie At one point just before Angela kills one of her victims she says Let this be a lesson to you Say no to drugs Real subtle screen writing there guys Then again the dialogue is the most entertaining thing in the movie Angela who by the way went through all that therapy and those operations and all that trouble to clean up her past and reinvent herself as a normal and well developed person and then changed her name from Angela to umm Angela says at one point I don t like being the wicked witch of the west but I know what happens when things get out of control People start getting killed by me HA br br Then later she demands that one of the counselors Mare make an apology to which the girl replies I d rather die Sorry Mare but you really walked into that one br br Two years ago I was a camp counselor at a sleepaway camp similar to the one portrayed in this movie except the camp that I taught at had more than three kids to the 15 or 20 counselors and it also had rules which the one in the movie doesn t This made me notice the myriad of discrepancies in the movie from what camp life is really like br br That s okay though you can hardly make a movie like this with a lot of 9 year olds running around although there were some 10 or 11 year old kids killed in this movie I hadn t seen that kind of thing much before br br Definitely bad taste even for a cheesy 80s slasher movie
Angela Johnson Pamela Springsteen yes she s related to Bruce the killer from the first film is up to her old tricks again She s one of the counselors at Camp Rolling Hills As long as the girls at camp are nice and stay away from sex drugs and swearing things are fine But a few step over the line and Angela kills them cracking bad jokes all the way br br The original Sleepaway Camp was a vicious and nasty splatter film but had some good points to it This is vicious and nasty too but has NO good points to it The plot has been done to death and this adds NOTHING new to the formula There are plenty of gory killings in here people are burnt alive heads are cut off throats slashed but all the gore is so obviously fake it actually become comical This also has the smallest amount of campers I ve ever seen and virtually everyone is far too old for their roles especially Higgins As expected there s the gratuitous female nudity here provided by the tremendously untalented Valerie Hartman and the obligatory good girl good boy team Renne Estevez and Tony Higgins With the sole exception of Springsteen and Higgins the acting is lousy even by slasher movie standards There s also a cruel edge to this movie in which one character is drowned in an outhouse Boring and sick with a stupid plot pointless nudity and bad gore Skip it
Despite being a sequel to the more potent original this is more of a comical remake of Friday THE 13TH concerning the further antics of psychopathic Angela killing more nubile teens for their immorality at a camp br br Pamela Springsteen sister of Bruce looks great There are some pretty darn funny sex scenes with some pretty darn attractive girls but the movie s so unintentionally comedic rather than suspenseful it s a stinker br br out of br br MPAA Rated R for graphic violence and gore nudity and for some sexuality language and drug use
This movie was bad from the start The only purpose of the movie was that Angela wanted to get a high body count The acting was horrible The killings were acted out very badly Like when Ally got stuffed down that toilet I guess it was in the abandoned cabin But when the end of the movie comes and Molly and the other guy are in the cabin you see Ally so Angela must have gone in to get her The part that really got me was when the black girl and Angela were in the cabin and Angela took the guitar string and chocked her One it was horrible acting and two why wouldn t you just turn around and punch the bitch Then when Molly is getting chased by Angela if you have the neigh why not just turn around and stab her So stupid This movie sucked
This is an immoral and reprehensible piece of garbage that no doubt wants to be a Friday the 13th 1980 clone The poster for this movie makes it look like there s going to be some sort of a cross between Jason and Freddy which is likely to attract movie goers There is NOTHING good or entertaining about this movie about this movie It just makes me sad just thinking that some people are going to stumble upon Sleepaway Camp II Unhappy Campers 1988 on video or DVD and waste their time with this sad cynical depressing movie br br Angela Baker Pamela Springsteen is a camp counselor at Camp Rolling Hills who hopes that the other campers are as nice as she is and that they stay out of trouble Meanwhile the other campers are realizing that people are disappearing one by one with Angela making up the excuse that she had to send them home Could Angela be the killer who was once a man who underwent a sex change operation years earlier Who knows Who cares br br The 1980s was home to a lot of movies that made the cross between the Mad Slasher and Dead Teenager genres in which a mad killer goes berserk Some have a plot some don t but they re all about as bad as this one Sleepaway Camp II Unhappy Campers is 80 minutes of teenagers being introduced and then being stabbed strangled impaled chopped up burned alive and mutilated That s all this movie is It is just mindless bloody violence br br Watching this movie I was reminded of the Friday the 13th movies in which the message for its viewers was that the primary function of teenagers is to be hacked to death The filmmakers of Sleepaway Camp II have every right to be ashamed of themselves Imagine the sick message that this movie offers for its teen viewers The world is a totally evil place this movie tells you and it ll kill you It doesn t matter what your dreams or your hopes are It doesn t matter if you have a new boyfriend or a new girlfriend It doesn t matter what you think what you do or what your plans for the future are You can forget those plans because you re just going to wind up dead br br And the sickest thing is and by not giving too much away the movie simply sets up room for a sequel Well why not They ve probably and already taken the bucket to the cesspool by making three or four of these movies I missed out on the original Sleepaway Camp 1983 and after watching its first sequel I will hopefully stay away from the other sequels as well as the original And for parents if you know kids who actually LIKE this movie do not let them date your children
No wonder Pamela Springsteen gave up acting to become a full time photographer it s a much better idea to have her behind a camera than in front of one While this movie is not without its interesting elements mullets from hell etc it is outweighed by flaws For one thing Angela the murderous counselor appears to be about the same age as the campers Having an older more threatening camp director would have done a lot for the film And then you have the murder scenes The budget was apparently too low to execute most of them properly no pun intended although drowning someone in an outhouse toilet is certainly original But overall there are a ton of movies out there that are scarier more fun to spend an hour and a half of your life watching
Being a slasher film aficionado I typically will settle in to watch every slash movie that passes over my retinas which sometimes does more harm than good to my brain I will say While channel surfing the other night Sleepaway Camp II happened to cross paths with me Of course I wanted to check it out as I had heard of the Sleepaway Camp franchise but have never actually seen any of them for shame I know I will note that since I have not seen the original my criticism should probably not be taken too seriously because perhaps what I think is wrong with it is totally intentional by the franchise s own design br br Now I m assuming that the franchise of Sleepaway Camp is in itself a joke on itself Hell even the name comes off as an intentional joke Sleep away camp It s good fun I can appreciate the film for wanting to just put together something for pure camp horror value but that s about as far as I can go The acting in this movie made the cast of the original Friday the 13th look like thespians doing a rendition of Macbeth Campy requires bad acting but come on Pamela Springsteen as the evil out of touch with reality killer did a better job of killing off my interest than she did killing off the entire cast As far as comedy goes there were a few times where I chuckled but it was few and far between br br Ultimately SAC II is pretty boring and I really did want to sleep away the camp The deaths are so obviously staged and fake that you can barely appreciate them If you re looking for a slasher film comedy with good camp I recommend Club Dread If your channel surfing takes you across this one check and see what else is on
After the debacle of the first Sleepaway Camp who thought that a franchise could be born SC II is superior in aspect More inspired killings and just whole lot more fun While that might not be saying much compared to the first movie Sleepaway Camp II is worth the rental br br Pros Entertaining doesn t take itself too seriously like SC I Inspired Killings Cons Crappy acting and mullets abound br br Bottom Line 5 10 br br
Me and my friend rented this movie for 2 50 And we both agree on one thing br br THIS IS THE WORST MOVIE EVER MADE br br Also me and my friend counted 475 face shots Which makes up 95 of the movie br br So in other words DO SEE THIS MOVIE UNLESS YOU LIKE WASTING MONEY And I do br br
This is a big step down after the surprisingly enjoyable original This sequel isn t nearly as fun as part one and it instead spends too much time on plot development Tim Thomerson is still the best thing about this series but his wisecracking is toned down in this entry The performances are all adequate but this time the script lets us down The action is merely routine and the plot is only mildly interesting so I need lots of silly laughs in order to stay entertained during a Trancers movie Unfortunately the laughs are few and far between and so this film is watchable at best
Why review good movies when you can review Trancers II br br Ooh this film is soooo lame I can just picture the cast and crew driving around L A with a camcorder hurling extras in silly monster make up at poor long suffering Tim Thomerson The stars families actually turn up to play cameos probably because Full Moon couldn t afford real extras Lame effects lame sets and a script so convoluted it would take eons to untie all the knots this must be classic Trancers br br And yet and yet it rules Note this is the same thing I say about Trancers IV I say it because it s true What can beat watching an old guy in a trench coat mow down zombies then bust out with quips like Don t worry ladies they re bio degradable Well lots of things could be better but anyway this is still good stuff br br My only significant reservation is Megan Ward who really stinks up the joint She s a lousy rival for Helen Hunt s character they re both young pieces of eye candy and it would ve been more effective if they actually contrasted a bit more Oh well you can t have everything At least the wonderful plot device of the long second watch is back in place and we ve got more of Hap Ashby the least convincing athlete in the history of cinema oh wait a minute he s got a rival in the form of David Ogden Steirs in Creator br br I haven t seen this lately but I do seem to remember that Martine Beswick runs away twice during the final battle Hooray for lousy continuity Just one of the many highlights in this fine film
The original Trancers is not by any means a great movie It had massive plot holes and very little in the way of internal logic However it was entertaining better done than most low budget B movies and could be surprisingly witty Unfortunately Trancers II is none of these br br Trancers II suffers from many of the same problems of most flop sequels The plot is thin enough to see through and the writing is insipid It seems that the people behind this movie felt that bringing the familiar faces of the first movie back would be enough and didn t bother with anything else Not even veteran B grade actors like Tim Thomerson and Jeffery Combs were able to drag this film out of the muck br br A brief plot overview Jack Deth Thomerson is a cop from the future who was sent to 1985 to save the ancestors of members of his government Trancers II takes place six years after the events of the first Trancers Jack Deth is married to Lena Helen Hunt the woman he met in the first movie and both live with Hap Ashby the man Deth was sent into the past to protect It is discovered that the brother of Whistler the bad guy from the first movie has traveled back in time to create an army of Trancers people turned into mindless killing zombies to kill Ashby Complicating Jack s mission is the fact that his first wife who had died long before Jack traveled to the past was also sent back to stop Whistler s brother and now Jack finds himself working with her br br I have two real problems with this movie One is that the method of creating Trancers in this movie is radically different from the methods used in the first movie What makes it annoying is that in a rather poor example of Soviet Revisionism they act like it was always the technique br br The other thing that annoys me is that the love triangle between Deth Lena and Alice Stilwell Jack s first wife is given very little screen time This bothered me particularly because it was much more interesting than the actual plot of the movie It felt like it was just something that was thrown in to fill space in the movie Alice s character in particular seems very unconcerned with the fact that she is reunited with her husband only to find he s re married making her either very shallow or very poorly written br br The only reason I can think of for watching this movie is if you re interested in watching the entire Trancers series currently totaling six movies Otherwise even if you re a fan of the original Trancers stay away from this tepid sequel
Since the 70s writer producer director Charles Band has been responsible for literally hundreds of science fiction fantasy and horror B movies Some of them are wonderful examples of how to use a tiny budget to maximum effect many of them are pretty bad Trancers 1985 was one of those rare gems br br A Terminator style tale of time travel and action Trancers saw Tim Thomerson playing Jack Deth a future cop given the task of tracking down bad guy Whistler who travels into the past by inhabiting the body of an ancestor Whistler is capable of controlling other humans with his psychic powers converting them into obedient zombies the trancers of the title and attempts to alter the course of history by killing off the ancestors of the leaders of the future Jack follows him to 1985 determined to stop him br br In this 1991 sequel Jack is still living in 1985 Having destroyed Whistler he has settled down and married Leena Helen Hunt the young woman who helped him succeed in the first movie But for Jack things don t stay calm for long and trouble appears in the form of Whistler s brother E D Wardo who is trying to build a trancer army br br Trancers II lacks the charm and simplicity of the original and is a huge disappointment considering how good the original was The story is difficult to pick up if you haven t seen the first film or at least not for a long while and there is loads of unimpressive action and a few poor special effects Gone is the inventiveness and wit that made Trancers so much fun instead we get some cheesy one liners and a script that feels like it was written on the fly br br About the only reason I can give for recommending this film to fans of the genre is the cast which boasts many names that will be familiar to followers of sci fi and horror movies Jeffrey Combs Barbara Crampton Richard Lynch Martine Beswicke Unfortunately most of them seemed to be having an off day whilst filming Trancers II and performances are mediocre at best br br The Trancers series obviously has its fans four further sequels have since been churned out Unless the quality has taken up massive upward swing I can t imagine them being any good
Annie s wig does not look good she is not cute and pretty enough to play Annie Annie sticks out in the movie as her outfits look like Halloween costumes terrible acting and terrible plots This movie is such a change from the 1982 version I think that a younger and smaller girl should have had the lead role Ashley Johnson portrays a very boyish Annie Not appealing at all At least the casting director got it right with Daddy Warbucks Ms Hannigan was also miscast Camilla Belle played Molly alright Warning this movie might insult your IQ so you might just want to only show it to very young children 8 and younger Some of the plots are too fictional and could hardly take place in the real world
Not even worth watching this tacky spoiler ruins everything about Annie The characters seem almost cheapened by the poorly written storyline and they low quality feeling to the production It was very clearly made for TV yet if I found it on my television I would flick it straight over The children in the film do an alright job yet the adults acting is unbelievable and so the movie fails to really draw you in This film lacked the music dance numbers thats made the original brilliant and truly does take the shine of the Annie we all love Johnson as Annie is at times annoying and over acted you cannot convince yourself that she truly is Annie The differences in character appearance continued to irritate me throughout the duration of the film Sad to say this sequel was a total flop
This film is absolutely awful but nevertheless it can be hilarious at times although this humor is entirely unintentional br br The plot was beyond ridiculous I don t even think a 2 year old would be convinced by the ludicrous idiocy that the film makers tried to slap together into a story However on the positive side some of the horrifically inane plot twists provide a great deal of humor For example Wow Lady Hogbottom has a giant missile hidden in her back yard It gets worse and even funnier but I ll spare you br br The acting is generally laughable Most of the kids roles are sort of cute but not very believable On the other hand Annie is pretty awful all around The adults don t take their roles seriously at all but this is largely a good thing If they d tried to be believable the film would ve been even worse Which is difficult to imagine br br Once you get past the overall crappiness of the movie there are actually a few standout moments of almost not crappiness The scene where Lady Hogbottom s son runs away with the maid is surprisingly hilarious though it s an annoying letdown when they get caught by the police The butler character while very minor is a ray of sunlight that almost but never quite pierces through the gloom br br Watching this movie actually caused me physical pain Nevertheless there were a few redeeming parts that made it almost watchable without beginning to hemorrhage internally Judged on its good parts alone the movie would be about a 5 unfortunately the rest of the movie hardly deserves a 1 Thus I give it a 3 br br That s being pretty generous I d say
Unfortunately there was not a 0 for a rating or else I would ve chosen it This movie lacks the star power that the original movie had in such abundance Carol Burnett Albert Finney Tim Curry Bernadette Peters Edward Hermann the innocence of newcomer Aileen Quinn and expert directing from seasoned pro John Huston father of actress Angelica Huston is what made this film so charming Even the 1999 remake with Kathy Bates Victor Garber Alan Cumming and Kristin Chenoweth had more to offer than this sorry excuse for a sequel Before she did this movie all Ashley Johnson was known for was her role as little Chrissie Seaver on the prime time show Growing Pains She had a few bit parts in movies but I don t know who thought she had talent enough to carry a movie on her own And adding Joan Collins as Lady Edwina Hogbottom ridiculous They couldn t get good enough actors to play the major roles like Daddy Warbucks Miss Hannigan and Annie but they will sign Joan Collins to play some British lady It doesn t surprise me that this movie was as bad as it was The critics were right to have not agreed with this movie even if it was only made for TV it was a poor sequel to an otherwise lovable movie
Well where do i start i think it s very insulting to the original Annie with Aileen Quimnn I love the film Annie and i was expecting this to be a brilliant film but i was so disappointed the acting is awful the original Annie came out a few years before i was born I m now 25 and Annie is still one of my favourite films So i was really excited to see Annie 2 The acting was awful in the film were any of the characters original very badly written directed and acted This is not a film i wish to see again and any Annie lover i recommend that you don t watch this film because it will only leave you very disappointed The young girls singing isn t bad but still doesn t compare to the original
Christ A sequel to one of the most cloying films of all time this at least has the decency to leave out the songs bar a reprise of the unbearable Tomorrow but does continue the tradition of being nauseating and unfunny This time Annie and her friends head off to London and get caught up in Joan Collins s plot to blow up Buckingham Palace or some such shite The movie has a bizarrely sycophantic attitude towards its eponymous character at odds with how irritating she is every time the little bugger squeals Leapin lizards I could feel my teeth grinding themselves down into powder Drearily photographed slushy and plodding the movie has only one memorable line Unhand me you stupid genius and the fact that it s not the original to recommend it
Worst movie with the best reviews given it I ve ever seen Over the top dialog acting and direction more slasher flick than thriller With all the great reviews this movie got I m appalled that it turned out so silly shame on you martin scorsese
What ever possessed Martin Scorcese to remake this film And not only did he remake it completely ruin it The nonsensical decision to make the character played by Robert DeNiro in his most overdone performance and that s saying a lot into a religious fanatic is ridiculous and exemplary of attitudes harbored by Hollywood and Mr Scorcese especially attitudes that compel writers to think that the best way to make a character insane is to tattoo a crucifix on his back In any case this movie is awful br br
This remake of the 1962 orginal film o the book has some very good parts to commend it and some fine performances by some fine actors however Scorsese opts toward the end for the most formulaic of plot twists and an embarrassingly overacted shakespearean demise that had me looking at my watch br br DeNiro is a superb actor dedicated to giving his all in the work he does however he needs direction to focus his talent and this is sorely lacking in the last five minutes of the film br br Gregory Peck s cameo is serviceable but nothing more whilst Robert Michum is always fun to watch even with as few lines as this br br Nick Nolte turns in a better performance than Lorenzo s Oil but is not on the same form as Weeds Joe Don Baker has some great lines while Juliette Lewis proves yet again that talent sometimes skips a generation br br Some good points The start credits the first view of Cody s back when doing dips in the prison the scene where Cody is attacked with baseball bats Sam Bowden s decent into full fledged panic Cody s outwardly calm but unnerving prescence br br The worst The Cleaning woman BUT NOT REALLY part Clinging bare handed to the underside of a car for a hundred miles at high speed Are there no speed bumps in the US The He s dead BUT NOT REALLY partS and the aforementioned rambling ending br br I may watch the original again but I ve yet to be tempted to watch the remake in four years since seeing it
Worst De Niro Scorsese collaboration in this horrible agonizing violent overlong mess Scorsese is totally out of his element in this film with the horror cliched suddenly loud phone ringing and door slamming gimmicks that seem laughable and embarrassing coming from such a master craftsman The cast is totally wasted here and the southern accents are very annoying and forced Nick Noltie plays the wimpiest lawyer in history who would ever believe he can defend anyone De Niro s psychotic Bowden is nothing more than the typical 90 s movie psycho killer The scene with De Niro and Lewis early on is very awkward and the climax goes on and on and we should all be more than tired of the on psycho stalker that never dies One of my most horrible movie experiences Rent the original it s 100 times better br br
While I can t deny that his movies are often entertaining I have always personally felt that Martin Scorsese is just a little overrated in his abilities His use of flashy stylistics in a good number of his movies seems to scream Look at me aren t I an imaginative director His best film that I have seen is the one with the least added flourishes the superlative Raging Bull br br For this remake it appears it was business as usual though The dull film stock to convey a 1950 s setting was so bland as to be a distraction in itself The melodramatic close ups combined with the sub par imitation of the classic Psycho score are more likely to provoke smirks of derision than a sense of atmospheric terror The score for Psycho was brilliantly unnerving this homage just sounds shrill and annoying Even the cast who can be decent at times deliver histrionic performances that just scream caricature the notable exception to this being an intelligent turn by Lewis as the impressionable teenage daughter of the Bowden family br br The worst acting offender here is surprisingly De Niro Sure he looks suitably menacing but as soon as he opens his mouth that aura just drains away Now I m no expert on American accents me originally coming from near Manchester in England an all but surely he could ve come up with a more convincing Southern drawl than that Being the gifted physical actor he is he almost overcomes this fatal flaw but not quite It was disconcerting for me as a De Niro fan to be wishing he was off screen rather than rapt at his performance br br POSSIBLE SPOILERS br br The over the top style of the whole movie extends to the ridiculously overblown finale When will Scorsese learn that underplaying the situation can sometimes build tension just as effectively as giving the viewer a visual and sonic bombardment I also thought that he was too respected a reputation to resort to the killer not dead yet cheap trick that less talented individuals might employ br br All in all a thoroughly ridiculous thriller Scorsese and De Niro have done MUCH better work together
I m surprised this movie is rated so highly although if I were to go with typical grade scale 71 is a c or d so perhaps that s all right but this movie was just a typical thriller except boringly slow and unrealistic Not that a typical thriller is realistic but this one seemed to be trying to and yet the woman who got rapped didn t press charges because she didn t want to be cross examined in a court even though she would be putting the man who broke her arm beat the crap out of her and raped her away for life not but also protecting the lawyer whom she had feelings for and his family not just random people she didn t even know There were other similar problems with the movie which would have been all right if there was some kind of moral to take away from the movie but the few moral questions like whether it was right to try to kill beat Kady before he did anything illegal were presented a little one sided since Kady ended up being just a crazed bastard bent on revenge so sure the lawyer was justified in protecting his family since waiting for Kady to actually rape his daughter so he could do something legally about it would be a bit absurd So now I ve just waisted more of my life for this stupid movie so please don t see it so at least your life won t be waisted and that way my 2 1 2 hours or so has meant something
One of Scorsese s worst An average thriller the only thing to recommend it is De Niro playing the psycho The finale is typically of this genre i e over the top with yet another almost invincible immune to pain villain I didn t like the 60s original and this version wasn t much of an improvement on it I have no idea why Scorsese wasted his time on a remake Then again considering how bad his recent movies have been I m referring to his dull Buddhist movie and all the ones with his new favourite actress the blond girl Di Caprio this isn t even that bad by comparison And considering Spielberg wanted to do the remake could have been far worse
I really don t want to compare Martin Scorsese s Cape Fear to the classic 1962 Cape Fear film but I can t help it Not only am I a huge fan of the Robert Mitchum and Gregory Peck starred Cape Fear but when Scorsese includes scenes right out of the previous film Cady taking the keys out of the ignition dog dying and even using Bernard Herrmann s score throughout the entire film he s not giving me a lot of opportunities to not make a comparison as I can t help but think of the classic Cape Fear nearly every scene When comparing Scorsese s version of Cape Fear to the classic version the remake comes out destroyed by the classic but even when taking the film by itself it s still bad br br Now Scorsese and screenwriter Wesley Strick didn t just remake the 1962 Cape Fear scene for scene they tried to do things differently Unfortunately this is one of the film s problems Gone is the original crazy and animal like Max Cady who is out for personal revenge the Max Cady in the 1991 version is a religious fanatic out to save Sam Bowden and who is in touch with his feminine side his words not mine Also gone is the stand up and strong Sam Bowden seen in the classic Cape Fear film the Sam found in the 1991 remake is very goofy Magoo distrustful and very unlikable Even Mrs Bowden is a completely different character she s crazier than Max Cady is The overall story has also been changed around Sam didn t testify against Cady in court to put him in jail like in the classic version Sam is now Cady s ex lawyer who Cady suspects of not doing all he could to keep him out of jail and is out to save him br br The overall story has been changed and I don t hold too much against it but the overall script is also weak all around Other sub plots have been thrown into the mix that not only distract from the bigger picture they are also just poorly written The film also includes a few frankly absurd scenes and is filled with apathetic and even ridiculous lines that you can t take the least bit seriously These aspects take away from the dangerous and thrilling nature that the film is supposed to have but they have some help in this department as well br br Now the classic version of Cape Fear was extraordinarily filmed with brilliant lighting and a powerfully effective suggestive subtlety combined with a barefaced brutality that delivered thrills when the film called for it and a sense of danger throughout its entirety However Scorsese is unable to do any of this in his Cape Fear giving the film a cookie cutter early 1990s look no sense of danger no suspenseful scenes and little style unless you count animating fire and the skyline style Yeah there is some gruesome violence and some effort was put in to make this Cape Fear bigger than the original but it ends up empty and all shock but no awe br br If all that wasn t enough the acting isn t great either Robert De Niro being somehow nominated for an Academy Award for his performance starts off alright as Max Cady but he gets progressively worse until he begins to get nothing but laughs instead of scares by the end of the film The opposite thing happens for Jessica Lange and her performance of Mrs Bowden going from overacting for most of the film to giving a convincing display of fear and desperation towards the end As Sam Bowden Nick Nolte stays the same throughout the whole film beige Juliette Lewis who also reeled in an Academy Award nomination is decent enough in her role as Danielle Bowden but she s called upon to play a real stupid character and it s hard to really like what we see on screen from her br br This film seems to be often counted as one of the few good remakes and I can t figure out why I wanted to like it I really did I mean if there s going to be a remake of Cape Fear I d rather like that one too but I just couldn t Containing nothing to be great on its own and being crushed by the unavoidable comparison to the original Cape Fear I found Martin Scorsese s Cape Fear to be a very bad film indeed The best things about the film are Robert Mitchum and Gregory Peck in their supporting roles go figure
I think we all begin a lot of reviews with This could ve made a GREAT movie A demented ex con freshly sprung a tidy suburban family his target Revenge retribution manipulation Marty s usual laying on of the Karo syrup But unfortunately somewhere in Universal s high rise a memorandum came down everyone ham it up br br Nolte only speaks with eyebrows raised Lange bitches her way through cigarettes Lewis Ohmagod s her way though her scenes and Bobby D well he s on a whole other magic carpet Affecting some sort of Cajun Huckleberry Hound accent hybrid he chomps fat cigars and cackles at random atrocities such as Problem Child And I want you to imagine the accent mentioned above Now imagine it spouting brain clanging religious rhetoric at top volume like he swallowed six bibles and you have De Niro s schtick here Most distracting of all though is his most OVERDONE use of the De Niro face he s so lampooned for Eyes squinting forehead crinkled lips curled Crimany Bob you looked like Plastic Man br br The story apparently began off screen 14 years earlier when Nolte was unable to spare De Niro time in the bighouse for various assaults Upon release he feels Nolte s misrep of him back then warrants the terrorizing of he and his kin And we re supposed to give De Niro s character a slight pass because Nolte withheld information that might ve shortened his sentence De Niro being one of these criminals who despite being guilty of unspeakable acts feels his lack of freedom justifies continuing such acts on the outside Mmm kay br br He goes after Notle s near mistress in a scene some may want to turn away from his wife his daughter the family dog ya know Which is one of the shortcomings of Wesley Strick s screenplay utter predictability As each of De Niro s harassments becomes more gruesome you can pretty much call the rest of the action before it happens Strick isn t to be totally discredited as he manages a few compelling dialogue driven moments De Niro and Lewis seedy exchange in an empty theater is the film s best scene but mostly it s all over cranked Scorsese s cartoonish photographic approach comes off as forced not to mention the HORRIBLY outdated re worked Bernard Hermann score I kept waiting for the Wolf Man to show up with a genetically enlarged tarantula br br Thus we arrive at the comedic portion of the flick Unintentionally comedic that is You know those scenes where something graphically horrific is happening but you can t help but snicker out of sight of others You ll do it here Nolte and Lange squawking about infidelity De Niro s thumb flirting he cross dressing and a kitchen slip on a certain substance that has to be seen to believed And Bob s infernal incessant CONSTANT mind damaging no end in sight blowhard ramblings of all the philosophy he disovered in prison I wanted him killed to shut him up more than to save this annoying family br br I always hate to borrow thoughts from other reviewers but here it s necessary This really is Scorsese s version of Freddy Krueger The manner in which De Niro relishes speaks stalks withstands pain right down to his one liners is vintage Freddy Upon being scalded by a pot of thrown water You trying to offer sumpin hot Please And that s just one example br br Unless you were a fan of the original 1962 flick and want a thrill out of seeing Balsam Peck and Mitchum nearly 30 years later or want a serious head shaking film experience avoid a trip to the Cape
Look I know this may suck right now but pain is temporary film is forever Whatever you do right now is burned into celluloid for all time and for thousands of years to come Robert De Niro br br This was initially a film for Steven Spielberg the director hiring several screenwriters to adjust the screenplay so that it more suited his themes And so we have a dysfunctional family that is threatened by a deranged monster in the form of a recently released from prison Robert De Niro Like Jurassic Park Poltergeist and War of the Worlds the dysfunctional family bands together to defeat the beast the beast being the creation of the father a lawyer who failed to defend De Niro during his trial br br In typical Spielberg fashion the father kills the monster that undermines the family and is then promptly absolved of his sins Like Oscar Schindler Robin Williams Sam Niel Tom Cruise and virtually every daddy figure in Spielberg land the father reclaims his paternal duty in the kind of bittersweet coda that Spielberg so enjoys br br But Spielberg eventually abandoned the picture and the project was instead turned over to Martin Scorsese who at the time was seeking to try his hand at more commercial fare The result is arguably the worst film in Scorsese s filmography and ironically his most illuminating br br An artist s failures or misfires are often very revealing exposing the inner workings of their art When the story doesn t work the characters don t connect or the images don t sear we find ourselves left with a kind of inner core This the remaining carcass is what the director s cinema is about br br Now Cape Fear is an impersonal film so we won t find any thematic connections to the rest of Scorsese s filmography You already sacrificed me De Niro yells but the films themes of Catholic redemption are cookie cutter What the film does though is expose the kind of language that his filmography hinges on Watch how Scorsese s camera desperately whips back and forth how he zooms frantically onto doorknobs and windows in an attempt to force tension and how his characters are all loud and screaming for attention But more importantly watch how the film makes no spatial sense A showdown on a boat at the end of the film takes place on an obvious sound stage a street parade is claustrophobic and takes place within no larger context and the family s house doesn t seem to exist anywhere in particular There is simply no geographical sense to anything in the picture Scorsese unable to film space or create any kind of spatial environment br br The reason for this is that Scorsese s camera always has to be bound or intimately tethered to his central character For the world around the character to make sense his camera has to be focused on the character Resnais can take you around a French Hotel Welles and Hitchcock can dance you down a street and up a building Cameron can give you a tour of the Titanic Scott can recreate an entire future cityscape Lucas can give you an alien desert planet and most other directors can create a sense of space by textbook close up mid shot wide shot combinations but Scorsese can t do this There s no poetry no sense of tangible space in his films He s all about the character You break that tether you leave that boxing ring that taxi cab you look away from De Niro and everything collapses He simply cannot break away from this very documentarian style of shooting which in a way is a prerequisite for action film making br br Scorsese tried to rectify this problem with Gangs of New York where the space and the sets become the central character but even this self consciously spatial experiment gets sabotaged by the magnetism of Daniel Day Lewis the actor drawing Scorsese s camera inexorably toward him like a moth to a bulb br br 5 10 Even as a generic B movie this is an ugly vulgar looking film Look at the matte paintings the inept attempts at tension the silly rotorscoped special effects and hokey fistfight showdown Still we have Robert De Niro to pick up the slack De Niro who gives his body over to Scorsese like a tattooed Christ gives the film its only great scene In an improvised romantic sequence with young a Juliette Lewis he sticks his thumb into her mouth and kisses her A kind of symbolic rape the girl runs away both aroused and repelled by this man s interest br br But De Niro s performance so deliciously over the top simply can t be imitated by Scorsese You d need the operatic tone and the baroque visuals of someone like De Palma to make this work But Scorsese Nope br br Worth one viewing
The film starts with a voice over telling the audience where they are and who the characters are And that is the moment i started to dislike the movie With all the endless possibilities any film director have in hand i really find it a very easy and cheap solution to express the situation with a voice over telling everything I actually believe voice overs are betrayals to the film making concept br br I hate to hear from a voice over saying where we are which date we are at and especially what the characters feel and think I believe that a director has to find a visual way to transmit the feelings and the thoughts of the characters to the audience br br But after the bad influencing intro a very striking movie begins and keeps going for a fairly long enough time The lives of a middle class family and all the members individually are depicted in a perfect realistic way I think the director has a talent for capturing real life situations For example a father who has to make his private calls from the bathroom might seem abnormal at first but life itself leads us some situations which might seem abnormal but also very normal as well I think the director is a very good observer about real life br br But that is it After a while the realism in the movie begins to sacrifice the story telling I really felt like I m having a big headache because of the non stop talking characters It was as if the actors and actresses were given the subject and were allowed to improvise the dialogs It is realistic really but characters always asking really is that so etc to each other or characters saying no or are you listening to me ten times when saying it only once is just enough causes me to have a headache br br I also think the play practicing and book reading scenes are more then they should be I understand that the play and the book in the movie are very much related to the plot but i think the director has missed the point where he should stop showing these scenes
The plot it s not so original If someone saw L ultimo Bacio there s nothing new A wealthy family in Rome living everyday life that s is boring and false with everyone asking to others what they think about them Really boring after an half of hour because it s simple to understand where the story is going to finish This because it s simple to see the moralistic view of Muccino in this movie so even the hardest parts seem normal To summarise in the first 2 minutes of the movie it would be enough and the aim of the movie were already said the family saw from a 30 years old i don t like to see movie that want to show the reality but for be coherent to his thoughts has to push more than the normal the situations Really good how Muccino put the camera in the right place moving with the carathers and it s the only reason that bring me not sleeping in the cinema though always in the movie scream from the begining Perhaps it could be good to see the family how they are in reality and not put the blame to something out of it Morante was intense and great as usual but unfortunatly on a bad movie
The actors did a really good job playing their roles particularly the mom However as the movie progressed I found I was watching it more for their acting and not because I cared in the least for the people And at times I felt irritated by the irresponsible and hands off approach to parenting displayed again and again The daughter is a 17 year old shallow skank whose main ambition in life is bedding famous men and becoming a dancing nyphette complete with lots of booty shaking The son is a guy with low self esteem that seems very desperate for a relationship and friends so much that he throws a drug party late in the film The husband and wife are both bored but rather than put energy into their stale relationship would rather seek out new partners though the wife picks poorly as the man she throws herself at happens to be gay OOPS I just felt that ALL the characters needed to grow up and had a hard time caring for such shallow jerks I think the author s attempt was to demonstrate the utter banality and hollowness of the capitalist system However given that these characters are NOT typical of the average western family it seems disingenuous
Beast Wars is a show that is over hyped overpraised and overrated Let s meet the characters of this obnoxious show whose creators must have been on acid to try and make a show like this br br Cheetor Seriously they need to have censor bars on this guy How come he dosen t creep out the viewers having the same voice as baby Taz at least Razzoff from Rayman 3 Hoodlum Havoc is voiced by Slip Slide Action Blast If you want a line of show that suck get G4 Tranceformers Cybertron A show that should go down in a toilet Good Job Creators Sarcasm Show it self Retarded boring at least the Super Mario games are better This show had a lot of followers sayin bring it back but I believe that it was cancelled for its own good
Growing up with the Beast Wars transformers I wasn t very familiar with the original Transformers and now that I have seen the awesome movie and now that I have seen the older cartoon on which it s based I have to say I like the original cartoon and the live action movie more than Beast Wars br br Not that I don t like the BW characters I just think that characters like Optimus Prime are better than Optimus Primal br br I mean AUTOBOTS TRANSFORM AND ROLL OUT sounds a lot better than MAXIMALS MAXIMIZE The voice of the original Optimus Prime still makes me a strong believer that he s a real commander more so than Optimus Primal br br Besides Powermaster Optimus Prime is a lot more powerful than Optimal Optimus Just look on the web br br Megatron in the BW character seemed more like a humorous version of the more evil version of him in the original series br br Besides what s cooler robots changing into animals or robots changing into vehicles and spaceships Gimme the original Transformers any day over Beast Wars

Usually any film with Sylvester Stallone is usually going to suck ass Rambo First Blood Part II was no exception to this The only movies that Sylvester Stallone were in that were good were Rocky and First Blood This film is extreamly unrealistic and boring It has action but not very good action I didn t enjoy watching it and I would never ever watch this again No wonder why it won the Razzie Award for Worst Picture I would give this a 3 10 the only reason why it got the 3 was because it had somewhat good action but not good enough
The summary pretty much sums it all up This is nowhere near as good as the original With a script co written by both Stallone and James Cameron at the same time he was also writing Aliens Most of the action was written by Cameron and the political aspects were written by Stallone br br Sly was in the best condition physically as he was making this and Rocky 4 and he does look in great shape or jacked up to the eyeballs on steroids depending on your own viewpoint or opinion br br Rambo starts off in prison and is visited by Colonel Trautman who asks him to go on a special mission that could earn him a Presidential pardon He eventually agrees and goes off to the briefing camp run by Charles Napier playing a Washington suit trying to pass himself off as former ex forces to placate Rambo br br The mission is to find out if there are any missing POWs still alive in camps in Vietnam Rambo was chosen as the camp he was checking was somewhere he had previously been a prisoner himself He is told it s not a rescue mission and he is there to take recon photos only br br After a bad attempt at parachuting from a plane he loses most of his kit meets his contact who turns out to be a cute woman and travels down river with pirates to the camp br br He finds there are still prisoners and rescues one As the 3 flee from half the Vietnamese Army on their river boat they are betrayed by the pirates but Rambo kills them all and they are forced to carry on to the pick up point on foot after their boat is rammed and blown up with Rambo almost on board br br Rambo is betrayed again and abandoned as Napier orders the recall of the rescue helicopter It is clear as Trautman returns to base to berate him that no survivors were expected to be found br br Steven Berkoff turns up as a Russian Spetznatz Colonel and Rambo is tortured and eventually escapes only to be pursued by more Vietnamese troops and Spetznatz Killing many of them Rambo finally steals a chopper and rescues most of the prisoners to return to his base br br He resists the urge to kill Napier for abandoning him but destroys the Ops Centre br br A weak plot and very weak ending as Rambo walks off into the sunset as a free man
By rights there should never have been a First Blood Part II The original script for First Blood had John Rambo committing suicide at the end of the film but this was changed to allow him to live not because the producers wanted to make a sequel but because test audiences found the original ending too depressing Nevertheless someone obviously thought that the character was too good to waste because he ended up as the hero of two more films in the eighties plus the recently released fourth instalment br br The official title of this film was Rambo First Blood Part II but it is more commonly known simply as Rambo It starts with the title character in jail where he is presumably expiating the crimes he committed in First Blood although this is never made too explicit He is removed from prison by his former commanding officer Colonel Trautman for a secret mission Rambo is to return to Vietnam to investigate reports that American POWs are still being held captive by the Communist regime He is under strict instructions not to attempt to rescue any prisoners or to engage the enemy his is to be simply a fact finding mission br br What Rambo does not realise is that he is being set up not by Trautman who is portrayed as brave honourable and incorruptible but by the organiser of the mission a military bureaucrat named Murdock Murdock intends that the mission will prove that there are no American prisoners in Vietnam partly because that will improve relationships between the American and Vietnamese governments partly because it will make his own life easier Unfortunately for Murdock Rambo discovers that not only are Americans still being held prisoner they are also being kept in hellish conditions Of course he is far too much of a hero to leave them to their fate and tries to rescue them The rest of the film is more or less one long battle between Rambo and a few allies including a beautiful Vietnamese girl and the evil commie soldiers and their Russian allies Most of the evil commies of course end up dead although I was surprised to learn from your trivia section that the total death toll was as low as 67 At times it seemed as though Rambo was trying to wipe out the entire Vietnamese army br br The tone of this film is very different from the first In First Blood Rambo was unquestionably a criminal even though his responsibility for his crimes was lessened by severe provocation and by his mental instability In Rambo he is a bona fide all American hero A few years earlier the director George Pan Cosmatos had made The Cassandra Crossing a biased piece of left wing anti American propaganda Cosmatos however was nothing if not versatile and Rambo proves that he could also turn his hand to biased right wing pro American propaganda The one thing the two films have in common is that both are laughably bad br br First Blood had its faults but it also had its virtues Its stance that the anti war movement was partly to blame for the problems faced by Vietnam vets in readjusting to civilian life was a controversial one but at least the film was trying to make a statement about war social attitudes to war and the roots of violence in society Rambo by contrast has very few virtues except that the action sequences are well enough done to please those who like that sort of thing It is essentially a sort of jingoistic revenge fantasy for those Americans who were still sore about the Vietnam war Rambo re fights the war single handed and this time the right side wins Take that Charlie Cong br br By this point no doubt the film s admirers and there seem to be plenty more than 2 000 voters have already given it ten stars will have concluded that I am a liberal commie loving pinko Far from it in fact I have always despised Communism as a pernicious ideology What I dislike about the film is not its politics but its lack of subtlety and its suggestion that the solution to all problems including ideological disputes is to go in with all guns blazing and to try and kill as many people as possible It makes no attempt to understand the political complexities of South East Asia or why not everyone in the region was pro American For all its anti Communism the film is the sort of moronic sledgehammer propaganda that the Communists were very good at churning out themselves except that they attributed all the world s problems to Capitalism or Imperialism or Revisionism or whatever other ism they had taken a dislike to Compared to Rambo The Green Berets was a masterly piece of political analysis 3 10
I think it s time John Rambo move on with his life and try to put Vietnam behind him This series is getting old and Rambo is no longer a solider but a cold blooded killer Ever time he turns up on the screen someone dies Vietnam was not a fun place to be and frankly I am tired of Hollywood making it seem like it was This is not the worst of the films concerning Vietnam that honor goes to John Waynes Green Berets In any case John Rambo carrying around a 50 cal Machine Gun taking on what seems to be half of the Viet Cong army plus a good many Russians is an insult to watch What is worse is Rambos cheesy speech at the end Please Oh yeah I heard they are making another one
The ghost of the Vietnam war has haunted the American psyche for thirty years now If not because of the fact that tens of thousands of American soldiers went MIA in Vietnam or the manner in which those who returned were treated then because it was the first war that America could be said to have lost Many men came home from the war a shadow of their former selves and the original First Blood managed to provide a small insight into their problems as they attempted to rotate back into the world as the saying goes First Blood Part II on the other hand is little more than a fist pumping mess that goes to illustrate how sore America can be both in victory and defeat Stallone puts in another sluggish performance as the titular Special Forces commando while Richard Crenna attempts to hold up the serious actor quotient Where it all comes undone is in the script which didn t do any better when it was called Missing In Action and starred Chuck Norris What little semblance of logic there was in the original is now gone as the filmmakers decide to paint a big S on Rambo s massive chest br br The film picks up a little while after the end of First Blood The film that is the novel didn t allow for the possibility of sequels In this mediocre follow up Rambo has been put to work at what appears to be some sort of open air mine As he is breaking rocks and working up a sweat a prison guard pulls him away to go and have a chat with Colonel Trautman who advises him that his government is willing to offer him an early release if he goes on a covert mission Rambo never one to back down from a hard day s violent work accepts and is promptly shipped off to a covert base in what appears to be Cambodia or Thailand I forget which From there he is commissioned to seek out a camp where American MIAs are supposedly being held and photograph them His mission quite clearly specifies that he is not to make any attempt to secure their release Rambo being Rambo however has other ideas in spite of their possible political implications br br Of course things go somewhat awry when it turns out that the people commissioning Rambo s work have more interest in making sure no American MIAs are found It is the age old conspiracy theory and makes no apologies for exploiting the plight of many an American family that was left without a son during the ten years that the official Vietnam war had been raging for Of course with the Jingoism that was inherent in American society during the 1980s they could not help but work in a plot tangent about the Vietnamese army being in bed with what appears to be a single battalion of Russians Together the two antagonists attempt to extract what information they can from Rambo but it backfires upon them in an orgy of bullets arrows rockets and destruction About the only thing missing is the moment when Rambo drinks from a grail like chalice and declares himself invincible br br To be honest First Blood Part II is a well photographed and well choreographed action spectacle The hand to hand combat with the larger Russian commander is one of the few battles in the film that has any dramatic tension whatsoever The rest is simply a case of the lead actor and the director building a fantasy for Americans to pump their fist to Fortunately this fad of America über alles action films soon died down when more introspective and intelligent war films such as Platoon began doing the rounds Some of the kills shown here are quite creative despite all the problems The Vietnamese commander meets an end that many an action film villain would envy The Russian commander bites it in a manner that is as spectacular as it is ridiculous Only in a 1980s action film would one see a LAW being used from inside a helicopter Sure there have been action film clichés rooted in contradictions of fact but never this ridiculous before br br I gave Rambo First Blood Part II a one out of ten It is so bad it is ridiculous and so ridiculous that it is often funny One doesn t even need to have served in the military to know how stupid some of the action sequences are The only risk it takes is in trying to make a stupid political statement with what is a heartbreaking subject for those directly involved Keep the tongue firmly in the cheek and it might be watchable
While the original First Blood had its far fetched moments it was at least exciting in parts In Rambo First Blood Part II the emphasis is shifted very much onto comic book action Plausibility is totally rejected logic nose dives Stallone becomes so impregnable that there can be no doubt he will succeed in his mission Just like any other wish fulfilment actioner of that time e g Invasion USA Commando Red Scorpion Rambo First Blood Part II cancels out its own opportunities for real excitement by presenting a hero too invulnerable to fear for If you can tell from the word go that Rambo is going to wipe out hundreds of enemy soldiers what is left to get excited about br br Imprisoned after the events of the first movie John J Rambo Sylvester Stallone is offered a pardon if he will join a covert operation in the Far East The year is 1985 and a mission is being arranged to find out if there are any American PoWs still trapped in the jungles of Vietnam Rambo is encouraged to take the job by his old mentor Colonel Trautman Richard Crenna but the assignment is actually the brainchild of a government outfit fronted by Marshall Murdock Charles Napier Rambo s job is merely to head for a prison camp in the jungle and check out if it contains any American PoWs if it doesn t he is to rendezvous with a chopper if it does he is to get photographic evidence of their existence so that they can be rescued at a later date Aiding him in his quest is a lady soldier with local knowledge the beautiful and resourceful Co Bao Julia Nickson Sure enough Rambo discovers that there are PoWs in the camp but he exceeds his orders by rescuing one of them when he reaches the rendezvous point the rescue chopper abandons him on the orders of Murdock who it seems doesn t really want to find any PoWs because of the political and military implications Rambo is captured by the enemy and tortured but following an explosive escape he sets out to free the PoWs and get his revenge on the treacherous Murdock br br The few good points of the film come from Jack Cardiff s polished photography Jerry Goldsmith s exhilarating score and the sheer professionalism of the stunt team in performing various action antics Beyond these scant pickings the film is a failure The actors are reduced to macho posturing the plot rings false the action sequences are soulless and suspenseless the dialogue is absurd even the violence becomes numbingly predictable At the time of its release America was under the presidency of Ronald Reagan a man with simplistic and near hysterical anti communist sentiments For this reason contemporary audiences lapped up this Commie bashing shooting fest as if it was the greatest movie of all time transforming it into an undeserved box office success Thankfully times have changed nowadays we can look upon it as a simple minded action flick with a ludicrously high body count ludicrously dumb politics and a ludicrous hero
I don t see much reason to get into this movie in much detail Sylvester Stallone is once again John Rambo author and survivor of A Season in Hell recruited from prison by his only friend Major Richard Crenna to secretly return to Vietnam take photos of the American prisoners believed to be still held in horrible camps and return without engaging the enemy br br Fat chance What if he actually DID nothing more than sneak in take pics and sneak out Who would come to see the movie br br It s essentially a celebration of Stallone s muscles Preparing for his mission we see his well oiled muscles bulging They are oiled and bulging throughout There is the ritual strapping on of black leather ugly guns and even uglier knives The black guns are cleaned assembled with loud clacks and almost as oiled as Stallone s muscles The bow is tested and yes it has enough poundage to drive a bolt through an enemy s forehead The knife is sharpened with slick snicks br br Stallone and one of his POWs are betrayed by one or two of the suits from Washington cynical politicians who you can bet were never even in a fist fight in grammar school No guts you know Just sit around with their feet on the desk and drink foreign beer br br The movie does what it set out to do but what it set out to do is meretricious It deliberately cashes in on the myth popular in the mid 1980s that there were uncountable numbers of MIAs quietly kept in wretched camps by the North Vietnamese The bumper stickers were ubiquitous Free Our MIAs Why would they keep them It was never quite reasoned out but perhaps to turn the POWs into a slave labor force in a country that has absolutely no resource other than labor Or maybe for their propaganda value as an instrument to humiliate the United States a propaganda weapon that the Vietnamese kept secret from the world br br As a captive Rambo is treated in a Medieval fashion by the North Vietnamese Dipped to his neck in pig excrement and then hauled out of it by his wrists his muscles still on display Then not content with subhuman Vietnamese a Russian officer is brought in to play the part of the Gestapo officer Vee haff vays of MAKING you remember A high tech type the Russian uses psychology and electricity not just pig dump br br Rambo returns and declares that he intends to drift aimlessly until this country loves us as much as we love it bringing up another myth that Vets returning from Vietnam were uniformly spat upon and cursed which is why I guess we elected so many to the Congress and appointed others to high echelon positions The last three losing presidential candidates were among that despised group At least Rambo s aimless drifting left room open for a sequel which arrived apace br br The action movies with Schwarzenegger and Willis and others were leavened by wisecracks but Rambo is humorless It marches dully through it s phantasmal ideological swamp killing without mercy barely speaking barely able to speak To speak is a sign of weakness
I remember I loved this movie when it came out I was 12 years old had a Commodore 64 and loved to play Rambo on it I was therefore really thrilled when I got to buy this movie really cheap I put it in my VCR and started up Man this movie is really bad Sylvester Stallone says like 3 words in the entire movie except for that awful sentimental speech at the end and has the same expression on his face all the way And that stupid love thing in the middle it s just so amazingly predictable I just ended up fast forwarding the entire thing and went to exchange the movie for something else
As an Army veteran I was deeply offended by this film In my opinion it is a disgrace to those who fought in the Vietnam war To say that the real SF soldiers I knew were offended by this crap is an understatement If the film were presented as satire or even as a cartoon it was it would have been better received But it was taken seriously my many people especially overseas Silly as it sounds wherever I went in Europe in the late 80 s people seemed to judge me and Americans in general by this film Unrealistic Hmm let s see A monosyllabic muscle bound cretin is pulled off a prison work gang to go on a secret mission to SE Asia to free some American POW s In a running battle he kills about 500 enemy soldiers with an M 60 machine gun that never runs out of ammo and never overheats And he never misses running with a 32lb gun held up with one arm I could go on but I m getting a headache I gave this a 2 10 only because it s slightly better than Rambo III
Years ago when I was a poor teenager my best friend and my brother both had a policy that the person picking the movie should pay And while I would never pay to see some of the crap they took me to I couldn t resist a free trip to the movies That s how I came to see crap like the second Conan movie and NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN Now despite this being a wretched movie it is in places entertaining to watch in a brain dead sort of way And technically the stunts and camera work are good so this elevates my rating all the way to a 2 So why is the movie so bad Well unlike the first Rambo movie this one has virtually no plot Rambo himself only says about 3 words other than grunts and yells there is a needless and completely irrelevant and undeveloped romance and the movie is one giant and stupid special effect And what STUPIFYINGLY AWFUL special effects While 12383499143743701 bullets and rockets are shot at Rambo none have any effect on him and almost every bullet or arrow Rambo shoots hits its mark And while the bad guys are using AK 47s helicopters and rockets in some scenes all Rambo had is a bow and arrows with what seem like nuclear powered tips The scene where the one bad guy is shooting at him as he slowly and calmly launches one of these exploding arrows is particularly made for dumb viewers It was wonderfully parodied in UHF starring Weird Al Plus HOT SHOTS PART DEUX also does a funny parody of the genre not just this stupid scene br br All in all a movie so dumb and pointless it s almost like self parody
This movie is a joke and must be one of the worst movies Stallone ever made This is a typical 80s movie where you have one man destroying the whole army by himself First Blood Pt 2 is very similar to Schwarzenegger s Commando but there you have Arnold killing the terrorist while here you have a specific nation showed as the bad guys This movie is a typical American anti Soviet propaganda True this was the peak of the Cold War but I m sick of having Communists or the Nazis always being shown as the enemy There are so many American movies that have this one thing in common Why can t there a movie that show Americans as the enemy Who s going to believe that one lone soldier will destroy the whole army Do you really think that something like this would have really happened By the looks of it an average brain washed American viewer certainly would
George P Cosmatos Rambo First Blood Part II is pure wish fulfillment The United States clearly didn t win the war in Vietnam They caused damage to this country beyond the imaginable and this movie continues the fairy story of the oh so innocent soldiers The only bad guys were the leaders of the nation who made this war happen The character of Rambo is perfect to notice this He is extremely patriotic bemoans that US Americans didn t appreciate and celebrate the achievements of the single soldier but has nothing but distrust for leading officers and politicians Like every film that defends the war e g We Were Soldiers also this one avoids the need to give a comprehensible reason for the engagement in South Asia And for that matter also the reason for every single US American soldier that was there Instead Rambo gets to take revenge for the wounds of a whole nation It would have been better to work on how to deal with the memories rather than suppressing them Do we get to win this time Yes you do
An offensively over the top action adventure FIRST BLOOD PART II seemed to catch the mood of the US at the time of it s release in the mid 80 s with right wing Reaganism and virulent anti red feelings still not finished yet though the emergence of a certain Mikhail Gorbachev in the heart of the Evil Empire in Moscow would soon render these types of films redundant even Reagan himself eventually admitted this truism br br In that sense we can be most grateful to Gorby not for his disarmament treaties with the US nor his policies of glasnost or even his support of democracy being restored to the Eastern European countries in the former Soviet Union s backyard No it s the final diminution of foolish jingoistic bloated cold war adventures like this The first RAMBO film was hardly perfect though at least was a mildly literate and adequate action thriller with a not too bad storyline In this sequel any sense of even the remotest conviction is instantly jettisoned for silly senseless plotting and incident in which Rambo single handedly takes on scores of brainlessly stereotyped Vietnamese and Russian troops to rescue American POW s ten years after the conflict ended with the Americans on the losing side br br Perhaps the reason why the film was a huge box office success was to let many Americans wallow in fantasy they may have lost the war but there was still unfinished business at hand and ludicrous comic strip heroics with a robot like hero killing virtually every red on sight with as much hardware as possible fulfilled such whimsically far fetched ideals br br This could have been entertaining on a SUPERMAN SPIDERMAN level but sadly everything is played absolutely straight But that is not to say that there is no humour in the film sadly it is virtually all of the unintentional kind The action scenes though technically adequate never once carry the slightest bit of conviction or persuasiveness because they are always placed in the most spectacularly unbelievable of contexts namely our hero Rambo is always unscathed aside from a few cuts and bruises here and there despite the tons of explosives grenades gunshots etc going around him br br In between the mayhem what there is of a script consists of the dullest clichés and banalities Stallone who co wrote the script with James Cameron a long way from the exciting TERMINATOR made the previous year deliberately seems to have given the Rambo character as little to say in understandable English and merely comes out with moronic grunts almost as though he has invented his own brand of patois only understandable to himself Maybe his colleague Cameron was thinking of The Terminator again with so little communication involved for the lead character In this sense Rambo seems even less of a human than the Terminator did The rest of the cast do little better with good actors like Charles Napier and Richard Crenna doing their admirable best with the hackneyed dialogue they are given and Steven Berkoff hamming it up outrageously yet again with another of his Russian KGB Red Army villain roles Berkoff s overplaying is mildly enjoyable but not remotely menacing How come that Sly managed to survive Berkoff s electric shock torture to kill yet more of those Red Commie scumbags Well credibility is never this film s strong point It is a work of fantasy comparable with THE WIZARD OF OZ At least that WAS meant to be a fantasy and an immortal classic it turned out to be This is only a classic of the most dismal and indeed offensive kind And as for Sly s climactic speech rather hypocritical after slaughtering all those people eh By the way in the same year he also made ROCKY IV br br RATING 3 out of 10
Like First Blood this attempts to make a point about the treatment of Vietnam vets but there really isn t much time for that in between the monotonous gunfire burnings stabbings torture and explosions as an impossibly indestructible Rambo takes out half of Asia a ton of Vietnamese soldiers most of the Russian army various vehicles and anything else he can point a rocket launcher at The only woman in the middle of all these boys toys is soon bumped off allowing the testosterone to reach dangerous levels and the script to degenerate into a succession of loud noises Helpfully supplying a few hackneyed musical cues is Jerry Goldsmith who carefully checks off all the clichéd themes from Russian rat a tat to Chinese ching chang chong just in case we don t quite understand who we re looking at Stallone has a brain in his head this empty nonsense is beneath him
Well what I can say about this movie is that it s great to see so many Asian faces What I didn t like about the film was that it was full of stereotypes of what typical racial characters would do in their role The Asian girl without confidence who has to play someone else to get ahead the white guy infatuated with Asian culture and chooses to leave his white world behind for the land of yellow and the keeping it real black cab driver Plus all the coke shanghai tang and dunkin donuts product placement was a bit too obvious The story plot itself was fun but pretty much how I thought the story would unravel Then again when watching romantic comedies you can t expect much but then again I would have been wanted to just be surprised at least once The parents are the best part of the flick
In what I can say was a theft of my time I was taken to see this movie and I must say what a horrible experience Fay Ann Lee is a terrible actress and is unconvincing in this movie Larryjoe76 is obviously a shill reviewer The plot is thin to say the least the Cantonese dialog is not funny See this movie at your peril br br David Tang from Shanghai Tang should be after the movie for the little or no revenue this movie will generate The banal plot attempts to compete with other rom coms out there and just blends into the scenery It was like watching paint dry br br In short this movie was a total waste of time and space I ve seen better movies on youtube
Don t get me wrong I love David Suchet as Poirot I love the series as well as the movies but enough already re Death On The Nile Everyone has done this one We know who dies We know why they die We know who the killer is We know how it was done So I say enough already Mr Suchet could have used that awesome talent in another one of Agatha Christie s novels I will say that the acting by all the actors was superb The sets were terrific and very realistic I especially liked David Soul but I was surprised at how awful he looked I hope he doesn t look that way in real life I honestly can t remember from other movies whether the very end was the same Somehow I don t think so I thought that was a rather brilliant touch whether or not Ms Christie wrote it that way I would much rather have that ending then wasting away in prison
As low budget indies go you will usually find that you get what you pay for and let me just say I didn t pay much for Frightworld br br Writer Director David R Williams brings us the story of an abandoned amusement park besieged by the vengeful spirit of a slain serial killer Not a bad premise but executed with a bevy of low budget mistakes The camera work tries to be too cleaver for it s audience by constantly using shaky quick cuts to cover the fact that they really have nothing gory or scary to show us This becomes evident right off the bat as we are introduced to the would be killer and soon realize that the acting is the scariest thing happening After a painfully long title sequence we are brought back to modern times yet the acting remains the same Frightworld does generate some rather unique cinematography when showing scenery from inside the fun house but with an extremely long running time it can t save the film from it s below average indie hell br br There is some mediocre nudity but not much for gore which is usually the saving grace for these types of movies br br Fans of really bad B Movies might find something of interest here otherwise don t spend a lot of cash
Very bad Very very bad As a fellow who aspires to make be in or at least sniff the catering table at a movie set I find it hard to criticize independents who actually got a movie of any sort made However this movie oh dear br br Realizing Frightworld doesn t aspire to anything more than crude exploitation an honorable thing in itself and to try to make it conform to more mainstream standards is a mistake And to be fair it is more entertaining than say Red Zone Cuba but not by much So I won t try to critique just let me ask throw out some observations br br 1 If gore is the point of the movie shouldn t you be able to see it br br 2 If you have hire three sound men make sure at least one knows how to operate the equipment br br 3 In a horror movie your lead maniac must be scarier than a smurf doll Difficult I know but really br br 4 There is a lot of talented videographers in the Buffalo Rochester area most you can hire really cheap Get one who knows how to frame a scene br br 5 Just because you have someone who knows how to use After Effects and other cool programs doesn t mean he should do so every two seconds br br 6 Kudos for getting the girls to take off their tops but next time get girls who s tops we want to see taken off br br 7 Editing should help tell the story or set a mood At the least in this sort of movie editing should sell the gore gags A chainsaw suddenly appearing in a characters stomach is not scary it s sloppy br br Some good things Not all the acting was bad Jack was pretty good and I liked Acid once she started fighting back There was some neat imagery unfortunately it was thrown up on the screen without rhyme or reason Acid Poptart is a name that deserves a better movie I like the moxie of Frightworld too Next time now that they have a movie of sorts under their belts I hope all involve aspire to something better than Colman Francis Upgrade at least Ed Wood
This was a weird movie It started out pretty good A solid sound track behind flash images of gore and mayhem as our psychopath did his thing br br Next comes his down fall Here i could tell I was in for a real cheesy B movie Poor acting I mean how hard is it to hold a gun and act like a cop These guys could not After the death scene of our psychopath we get the opening credit and the movie starts br br From this point on it is bad acting big boobs the occasional bucket of blood and poorly done death scenes br br That said I gave the movie a four because in spite of its flaws it did maintain a sort of creepiness that I just could not quite shake off br br I do not recommend this movie but I have to admit I have seem worse
This movie is actually worse than most movies I ve ever suffered through and I ve suffered through a lot Absolute nonsense It s got terrible forced dialogue pointless plot developments really drawn out spooky imagery scenes which look more like a high school remedial art project than a horror movie 5 10 at best attractive women long boring sex scenes involving said women forget what you know about virgins especially ones with lop sided fake breasts muttered difficult to understand speech from some of the characters and they actually used the masks from Killer Klowns from Outer Space during a masturbation scene which should be a saving grace because that movie was pretty funny but it isn t Veden Fell is the lamest bad guy in the history of film br br Absolutely give this one a miss
With the exception of the sound none of the above are really criticisms for this type of no budget truly independent horror film Make up effects and gore are very good and the lead actor was effective the lead actress although attractive needs some coaching as she was particularly poor br br The major problem with Frightworld is it s length at 108 minutes its half an hour too long to be effective as a slasher movie plot wise only about ten minute of the first fifty are relevant br br In places it is visually engaging and sometimes the lack of lighting works in the films favour However when this is combined with the poor sound as is the case with most of the film large sections are difficult to watch br br This could certainly be an entertaining if unoriginal serial killer back from the dead movie with some judicious and ruthless editing in its current form it plays like an unfinished rough cut
Honestly Barbra I know it s you who s klicking all those NO s on my review 22 times How many people did you have to instruct to help you out here Don t you have anything better to do like look at yourself in the mirror all day br br Steven Spielberg told Barbra that this was the best movie I ve seen since Citizen Kane That pretty much says it all and serves as a dire warning br br What are the ingredients for a sure fire cinematic disaster and one that will haunt you never letting you forget the tears of both laughter and pain The ingredients Barbra Streisand s face a musical feminism Barbra Streisand s voice Barbra Streisand directing and an ultra corny idiotic premise br br Hollywood is full of egomaniacs this much we know In fact nearly everyone by definition has to be an egomaniac in Hollywood Why would anyone want to act For the art Well if you re dumb enough to believe what they tell you in their carefully prepared interviews And Streisand has the biggest ego of them all This is quite an achievement To be surrounded by narcissistic cretins and yet to manage to top them all remarkable br br The movie like all her solo endeavors is an ego trip straight out of hell Every scene Streisand is in is automatically ruined Stillborn But as it that weren t enough she sings a whole bunch of Streisandy songs you know the kind that enabled the Mariah Careys the Celine Dions and the Whitney Hustons of this world to poison our precious air waves for decades now Just for that she deserves not one but 100 South Park episodes mocking her br br The premise Streisand dressing up as a man to study to become a rabbi sounds like a zany ZAZ comedy Apart from it being a cliché the obvious problem is that Streisand doesn t look like a woman nor does she look like a man in fact I m not even sure she s human The way she looks in this movie well it cannot be described in words E T looks like a high school jock by comparison She looks more alien than Michael Jackson in the year 2015 She looks HORRIBLE br br The songs They made me shiver Particularly Papa Can You Hear Me Squeel Like A Demented Female Walrus In Heat and Tomorrow Night I ll Prepare the Sequel YENTL 2 THE RETURN OF THE BITCH br br Did you know that Streisand considered having a nose job early on in her career but changed her mind when they told her her voice might change Can you believe that She should have done it Killing two flies with one swipe that s what it would have been br br If you re interested in reading my biographies of Barbra Streisand and other Hollywood intellectuals contact me by e mail br br SHOULD BARBRA STREISAND FINALLY GO INTO RETIREMENT CLICK YES OR NO
I remember when this piece of trash came out all the newspapers were squawking about how it had taken Barbra Streisand years to get the film made Well it couldn t have taken that many years the play only opened in 1975 eight years previously It made a Broadway star of the great actress Tovah Feldshuh who probably should have been cast in the film but NOOOOO the Great STAR BARBRA HAD TO DO IT HER WAY AND WITH MUSIC NO LESS This film is a total disaster from start to finish For one thing Barbra was FORTY YEARS OLD when she made it and she looked every minute of it There was no way anyone could possibly swallow her as a young girl yearning to study Torah And then when she dresses up as a boy it gets campy I get the impression that Streisand could not bear to be unattractive so she played around with the make up she is prettier as a boy than she is as a girl And as if that is not bad enough she gets involved with both her schoolmate Avigdor Mandy Patinkin whose best moment is the shot of his naked rear end AND his fiancée Amy Irving who does her usual sleepwalker routine a bit of schtick the poor woman always resorts to when the director ignores her and she does not know what she is doing Yentl even goes so far as to marry the girl I won t even bother to mention the wedding night scene br br Then there is the music Nine totally forgettable songs all sung by Streisand via voice over presumably as a look inside her mind and each one as intrusive and irritating as fingernails on a blackboard br br I won t say that Streisand does not show a glimmer of promise as a director here some of the visuals are lovely Patinkin s backside especially and she has a good eye for balance The problem with this movie is that she won t get out of her own way I did not believe her for one second in the title role she should NEVER have added the songs and on top of that the whole mess goes on for two hours and fifteen minutes I was sick of the whole sorry mess after forty five minutes br br Awful awful awful
Barbara Streisand directs and stars in this very Jewish story br br To have a chance at obtaining an education Babs enthusiastically disguises herself as a boy which isn t the most difficult thing to do since she already looks like a boy anyway At her new school she meets many male classmates who have no trouble at all in believing she s a guy br br Don t miss the best of many moments of unintentional humor when Babs male friend thinks she s a man but pins him to the ground sits on top of him and looks affectionately into his eyes snicker br br Mediocre film splashy story about nothing particularly interesting
My personal vision of hell is being locked in a room without the ability to close my eyes or block my ears and have this movie play for eternity on every available surface in that room The whole notion that Streisand plays a boy man only begins to scratch the surface of how ridiculous a premise this movie is The single most important thing about watching any movie is the concept of willing suspension of disbelief it is impossible to do that in this movie
I know I know Plan 9 from Outer Space is the worst movie or maybe Manos the Hands of Fate But I can t get worked up over those sock monkey movies Of course they re bad How could they be any good But if you re talking about movies with respectable production values and bankable talent the T rex of all turkeys has to be Yentl All the treacly phoniness all the self absorbed asininity that stains everything Barbra Streisand has done since 1964 reaches its culmination in this movie From its lonely summit of awfulness Yentl looks back to A Star is Born and forward to The Mirror Has Two Faces There is nothing else quite like it What emotional undertow dragged Streisand out to make this movie I would rather not speculate and what audience she was playing to I cannot possibly imagine although I ll bet there s a nine in ten chance you aren t a member of it br br Nobel Prize winner and saintly guardian of Yiddish literature Isaac Bashevis Singer was so outraged by what Streisand did to his story that he blasted her in public for it It is a tribute to Streisand s impenetrable vulgarity that she not only didn t commit suicide but went on to make more awful movies
This might be the worst film ever made and is possibly worth seeing for that reason alone Streisand is laughably unbelievable as a young woman posing as a man in order to study Judaism The soundtrack is torturous featuring Barbara belting out some of the weakest blather ever put to film And don t even get me started on the plot You will actually get more chuckles out of this film than many comedies because it is soooooooo terrible The rampant ego of Streisand thinking she could somehow raise this stinker to Oscar heights led to this disaster I m pretty sure the novelist Isaac Bashevis Singer hated this film and never forgave Streisand I can t blame him This movie is like watching a car wreck in slow motion for two hours with the soundtrack of The Sound of Music being played backwards on an old turntable It s truly that bad I m amazed that anyone from Streisand enjoyed this movie on the level that it was intended
A seemingly endless movie that really deserves a zero rating The premise seems simple enough Yentl a girl interested in studying the Talmud wants to go to school But only boys are allowed to study so after her father s death she decides to disguise herself as a boy to get in She does and becomes close friends with Avigdor who is to be married to a beautiful woman named Hadass Hadass family learns Avigdor s brother committed suicide and the wedding is called off Yentl now calling herself Anschel is then selected to marry Hadass She does but it is never consummated Yentl Anschel and Avigdor go away for a few days and Yentl Anschel reveals her secret to him The movie ends with Avigdor returning to and marrying Hadass and Yentl going to America to continue her studies although she will have to continue to do so in disguise br br The plot above seems interesting at first for a movie over 2 hours long but there are several things that ruin it For starters there is the constant SINGING I can already hear the critics shouting Yes I know this is a musical so there are supposed to be lots of songs and dance numbers But the movie could have been improved if it were directed and played without them The songs become tedious after a while and there isn t as much dancing as one would expect Many of the songs are forgettable with no real memorable lyrics and those with any significance could easily have been substituted by a voice over Only one song stands out from the rest Papa Can You Hear Me It is obvious that most of the others were deliberately placed so Streisand could simply have a reason to show off her vocal abilities every five to ten minutes Chances are anyone who will see this film will already know what a superb singer and actress she is so the songs really aren t necessary br br Second Streisand s makeup which can be seen during her scenes as a man the lipstick enhanced lashes and traces of blush are all obvious makes it hard for the audience to believe in the Yentl Anschel character that she is actually serious and fooling her new friends colleagues and even Hadass into believing she is a man Yet we are asked and expected to believe that very thing There seems to be a contradiction as her character talks or rather sings of how she doesn t think she can pull it off but is surprised that everyone seems to be fooled because she is wearing men s clothing This means that we are then expected to believe the other characters are so naive they can t see the other differences such as her actions which are clear giveaways The facial differences alone cannot be included as other characters in the film mention that some of their male relatives or friends didn t have a beard or other facial hair Nevertheless in the 1900s if a woman dressed as a man but wore as much makeup as Streisand s character did and still tried to pass herself off as a man solely because she wore men s clothing it would have been deemed unacceptable and caused an outrage Chances are she would probably be forced to leave the town or even the country Therefore the feminine makeup on Streisand does not lend to the character s credibility and only weakens the plot If it was only applied to make Streisand look more beautiful it should have been scrapped br br Thirdly when Yentl Anschel herself reveals who she truly is toward the end we are then asked to believe that the other characters are not as smart as Streisand s and only when they learn the truth do they become a little wiser By now it becomes more and more apparent that the whole plot is so far fetched that it is nothing more than a custom made vehicle for Streisand to fuel br br Lastly there are those who are fans of Streisand who will find no fault with this film its plot or the songs To those I must respectfully disagree While she has excellent vocal and acting abilities I am not a fan of her style of singing However I have enjoyed many of her other features including musicals There are even some songs of hers that I like so I am not a hater nor have set out to bash her I have written this review from an honest perspective from someone who has tried their best to watch this movie several times even and has noted the problems within If Streisand was interested in creating a great or even believable film she could have done so here by not injecting her need to show off and prove how talented beautiful and smart she is at nearly every turn This movie does nothing more than hurt her abilities make her appear self absorbed and thus turn the film into a laugh fest unworthy of her fans or audience
This movie started out good i felt like i was watching an adult version of Seinfeld Much to quickly i started questioning the situations and actions of the main characters and found no answers to why they were doing what they were doing All the acting was superb but only a few scenes had brief moments where they were actually funny Dan Cortese was amazing I loved him in this role His agent should show this movie to casting agents Watch the first few scenes and then find something better or else you will find yourself totally lost in this mess I found this in a bin at a video store It cost me two dollars and due to the rareness of this movie i feel like it was a good price
Michael Williams who works for BBC finds a somehow impressive Italian picture which gets mixed in the material of his ongoing task titled DIABOLICAL ART A DOCUMENTARY But since his wife s mysterious death her daughter Emily has been emotionally disturbed so he goes Spoleto where the problematic picture is with her and her nanny Jill And there is a Countess who is also a psychic and she informs him that the picture was somehow made at the night that a young witch named Emilia was executed Michael doesn t believe her story but after that Emily has hysterical spasm and Jill is killed This Italian film is of course almost innocently influenced by THE EXORCIST but this one is much cheaper much simpler and in a sense much dirtier First of all it should be said this film is full of confusion For instance the story shows Emily is a reincarnation of Emilia But when Emily sees her in the flashbacks she perceives her exclusively from a third person s point of view But if she is the reincarnation of Emilia she should and must see the past from nothing but Emilia s point of view Confusions of this kind which the film has many are almost exclusively based upon a problematic fact that the film is too cowardly rather than ambivalent to specify its own quasi Freudian theme namely pre adolescent girl s one way incestuous wish To make matters worse this film also has characteristic problem if not confusion every character is too naive and helpless to be realistic and or believable living human Regarding Emily or Emilia she is after all a child and one can say it is difficult to blame her mainly for her naiveness and helplessness And according to the Freudian theory every girl wants to have her father s child ren in her own way In this sense Emily is not exclusively pathological only her way of excluding other women from her father s love is problematically pathological But as I already mentioned this film per se is too cowardly to be Freudian The problem is that adult characters are as childish and naive and helpless as Emily is And because of this characteristic weakness even the psychic who can see almost everything cannot do anything down to earth and because of the same weakness the very story of the film is ended in a badly escapist way In addition special effects of this film are incredibly cheap and laughable Although Stelvio Cipriani s music is noteworthily beautiful indeed this one is so good that it seems to be worth having it alone the film as a whole is nothing but a cheap B film which can disappoint even the 1970s Italian horror film lovers
I saw this movie and at times I was unnerved believing this movie saw me Munchie sullies the farce for years to come Re watch Star Wars Don t watch Munchie br br As a responsible parent I m speaking to those who are parents now I you would not let my your child ever partake of this video festival of the pseudo occult To insinuate Munchie is satanic to a co viewer is likely to illicit a chilled duh He is fiendish alien rodential and wholly malevolent like the Bogey man made flesh invisible to adults tempting children with lifestyles they could never afford without the income made possible by years of self denial and prudent stewardship He is a peddler of easy answers and false ideals He is everything the morally conscious viewer is not He is the devil s own Ron Popeil br br I pray I mean this literally and figuratively with an emphasis on the former that this movie has not made the format jump to DVD It is my hope that this type of yellow film making died an un mourned death in the cold nights of 1994 br br Munchie also loves pizza I forgot to mention that It comes up a lot

I just don t see how a Concorde New Horizons film directed by Jim Wynorski and featuring the acting talents of Andrew Stevens and a puppet could be bad It just boggles the mind doesn t it br br Well let s make no mistake about it Munchie Strikes Back is indeed a bad film Munchie is a puppet who has been around for many centuries For reasons not fully explained until the end of the film he is sent to Earth to help a single mother and her son The mom s problem her main problem at least is that she has a balloon payment due on her mortgage in two weeks to the not so tiny tune of 20 000 Ouch She can t come up with the money because she just got fired OK JUST is the key word in that sentence What the Was she planning on paying it off with a single paycheck Maybe it would ve been a good idea to have spent the last several years saving up for it ya think br br Munchie has magical powers similar to those a genie would possess but there isn t a limit on the number of wishes you can make Munchie gets the boy a bunch of fancy stuff for one night but then the kid asks for it to be sent back to the mall Munchie was borrowing it from The annoying furball also uses his otherworldly skills to help the boy win a baseball game by means of cheating A baseball is hit so hard that it orbits the Earth several times Sadly those dumb parents watching the game don t think it s at all strange Hmm br br Anyway I d like to wrap this up because this has already drained away enough of my lifeforce as it is You ll be truly moved by the scene where Leslie Anne Down playing the mother kicks a dog which is yapping at her Your heart will melt at her charm when she notices dollar bills fluttering down on her front yard and she wonders how it could be snowing during the summer Munchie Strikes Back s credits promised another film to follow entitled I believe Munchie Hangs Ten To date the movie viewing public has been robbed of what would surely have been a cinematic tour de force Heh 1 10
I think that it was just pointless to produce a second part of a movie like My Girl My Girl was a very good movie but it is ridiculous making a second part of a movie in which one of the main characters Macaulay Culkin as Thomas J dies The story was over after the first movie I wonder why someone tried to find a way to make the story going on That was senseless
If you want to know what kind of music white people listened to in 1974 this is the movie for you But you ll have to listen to a lot of flutes and violins too see my remarks on My Girl 1 for the reference br br Indulgent admission I approached My Girl 2 with cynicism and annoyance having just viewed its predecessor But as an adoptee preparing to finally set upon a search for my birthmother My Girl 2 made me look with its theme of searching for mother br br Put another way anything I liked about My Girl 2 had nothing whatsoever to do with My Girl 2 but relating to a protagonist who asks like so many adoptees who s my mama And if there are home movies of my mom in an acting troupe I ll be sure to make my own movie about it br br People are listless Movies should not be listless My Girl 2 like My Girl 1 is just listless br br Avoid unless you re a complete sap who s comforted by a series of small annoyances
Quite simply this shouldn t have been made It s predictable and clichéd The on screen chemistry which made the first My Girl so captivating is nowhere to be found here and the acting as a whole is stilted and forced The writing also leaves much to be desired some of the memorable lines such as earpeircing a barbaric custom are just shocking Where My Girl provoked a genuine feelings of sadness and some genuinely funny moments like so many sequels My Girl 2 tries to recreate these emotions generated by the audience and fails miserably Maybe i m being hard on this film because of how great the first one was but quite honestly it insults the quality of the original with the sort of drivel this installment serves up Surely this has to come close to Son of the mask as being one of the worst sequels of all time In both cases the old saying rings true if it ain t broke don t fix it
Original Claymation Rudolph Pretty good Original Frosty cartoon Needs a little work but could be worse But Frosty and Rudolph together on the Fourth of July C mon Give me a BREAK This was one movie that shouldn t have been made It was bad It didn t really go for any holiday in particular except July 4 That made it especially bad since Frosty and Rudolph are usually associated with the Christmas season And any movie can be ruined by too much singing The frequent songs made this movie seem a lot longer than it really was The movie tried mixing two familiar Chirstmastime characters with an American traditional holiday which almost seems to limit it to America too many pointless songs and a lousy plotline The result A bad movie that can t really be watched at any time of year I would suggest you forgo this movie even if you like Frosty and Rudolph
A concept with potential and it was fun to see these two holiday icons together but br br Rudolph s glowing nose didn t require the explanation offered in this film much like The Force in the Star Wars films didn t need the explanation of medichlorians in the bloodstream But mainly the film left me cold because of Winterbolt s over complicated plot to destroy Santa He s got the power to put suggestions into people s minds so why does he do things in such a roundabout way Breaking the magic of Rudolph s nose framing Rudolph threatening to melt the Frosty family The comedically exaggerated plots of Pinky and the Brain and Phineas and Ferb s Dr Doofenshmirtz which are done that way on purpose and played for laughs seem simple and straightforward compared to Winterbolt s which we re expected to take somewhat seriously br br There is a particularly and amusingly strange moment when a character throws her two guns at the bad guy like boomerangs I understand if they don t want to have guns being shot in a family film but then why have guns in the first place
Ever since I was eight years old I have been a big wrestling fan It didn t matter what federation I watched WWE WCW USWA To me the action is all I watched it for br br May 23rd 1999 That was my 19 birthday I ordered Over the Edge and I was just expecting another pay per view But this time I was wrong Instead that was the night one of the best wrestlers to come out of Canada a true human being fell to his death due to a stunt gone wrong Not much you can do to change the situation But what happened affter Owens death made me very mad br br Rather then ending the pay per view and doing the right thing as human beings the WWE decided to protect what comes first and that was the money by keeping the pay per view going as if Owens death never happened br br I gotta tell you Vince Mchmaon has made some stupid decisions in his life but this was by far the stupidest decision he ever made br br And this crap with saying Owen would have wanted the pay pew view to keep going Give me a break When someone dies on a pay pew view its comon sense to stop it Thats like a police officer shooting a robber or a mugger with a run and then just leaving the man to die so he can go home and call it a day as if the mans life never mattered br br But no matter what happens Owen will be missed and thanks for the memories for all the times you gave us

This is one of the few episodes if not the only one with an indisputable error in its storytelling While handling the Ralphie situation Christopher states that he has heard about Pie O My s death in the fire accident This is an important detail because in this context it is quite obvious that Christopher knows from the beginning that Tony is the one who must have killed Ralphie There is however no way Chris could have heard about the accident Who should have told him and when By the time he is torn out of his delirium by Tony s call nobody else was informed Tony knows that which makes it even worse Hearing Christopher talk about Pie O My s death could therefore only lead Tony to the conclusion that Chris himself has set the fire Given the impressively elaborate writing process as told by the writers themselves on the DVD I really wonder none of them realized the problem there The story just doesn t work that way Unnecessary to add that I m a huge fan of the Sopranos Otherwise I certainly wouldn t care
I expected a bad movie and got a bad movie But I couldn t really imagine in my worst fantasy how bad this movie was I don t even want to try to explain what Blood Surf is about Is not about blood surfing but a big a crocodile They are complaining about the fake shark in Jaws but Spielberg was wise and didn t show the shark until the end Here the crocodile is shown a lot of times and it s the worst fake crocodile I have ever seen and they don t try to hide it If you want to see a good fake crocodile watch Lake Placid br br The director had an opportunity to make a decent surf shark movie but he had to make a bad b monster movie He had the chance to make an original surf movie but he wanted to make a monster movie So you have understand how bad this movie is does it have some good parts Not really it got some nudity and a sex scene that is taken straight out of a playboy movie The acting isn t half bad either and Kate Fischer looks good Too bad she doesn t take her top off The lead actors aren t bad either They had some potential The location was beautiful and the movie start good with some nice surf scenes The blame is on the untalented writer and director The dialogue is some of the worst I have ever seen and the script is really badly written and the director got no talent what so ever and not much of a fantasy either br br Don t watch it Even if you want to watch the beautiful Kate Fischer It isn t worth it Watch Sirens to watch Kate nude and watch Lake Placid if you want some good crocodile action br br 3 10 because I m in a good mood and Maureen Larrazabal looks good naked and Kate looks good but is bad actress and Dex Miller Joel West and Matt Borlenghi did a good job with the piece of sh t they had to work with
Blood Surf AKA Krocodylus is a fair film that has an okay cast which includes Dax Miller Taryn Reif Kate Fischer Duncan Regehr Joel West Matt Borlenghi Maureen Larrazabal Cris Vertido Susan Africa Archie Adamos Rolando Santo Domingo and Malecio Amayao The acting by the actors is fairly good The thrills are fairly good and some of it is surprising The movie is filmed fairly good as well Same thing goes for the music The film is fairly interesting and the movie does keeps you going until the end This is a fairly thrilling film If you the the cast in the film Monsters Giant Animal films Horror Thrillers Mystery and interesting films then I recommend you to see this film today
This film is awful The CGI is the very cheap gray blob CGI The crocodile looks like a large gray smudge The worst is that no effort at all is given to making it walk or look like it is alive It is mostly a photo shopped CGI that is placed into scenes and you almost expect to see the hand that is moving the CGI smudge across the screen This is one of the worst examples of CGI effects that I have ever witnessed and I have seen lots of the very bad Sci Fi Channel movies br br Aside from the terrible lack of special effects the cast is composed of the typical low cost actors who probably work as Waiters Waitresses at local diners while they wait for their Big Breaks Perhaps the most ridiculous scene in this movie is when one of the bad guys is attempting to sexually assault Kate and the giant crocodile jumps straight up out of the water to the second floor of the Villains Headquarters and through the balcony and pulls the bad guy off Kate and instead of crashing straight down through the building and crushing Kate the Croc just flies backwards at the same angle into the water No laws of Physics can apply to this movie or the special effects At least there is honor among crocodiles
Why o WHY did I pick this one up Well i needed a no brainer in the summer heat and the cover looked cool br br Of course I should ve known better This is a really really bad movie And it gets embarasing when the makers know it s bad and try cover it up by adding some sexy beautiful women and some sex scenes to it Well folks it does nt cut it does it br br If you WOULD like a cool movie about a big reptile that is actually very very good well played and funny go rent Lake Placid that is an order
SPOILERS SPOILERS If one were to review the film based on the premise alone one might think that you were looking at an average animal orientated horror flick The plot is as follows A group of documentary filmmakers head off to an island in order to film a documentary about surfing with sharks or blood surfing I live in South Africa so it was released as Blood Surf Admittedly this seems to have a somewhat interesting idea behind it which if it were explored further could have improved the movie somewhat However this is not the case as the blood surfing part of the movie is minimal due to the fact that their documentary is interrupted by a rather large salt water crocodile br br The script is absolutely terrible A good example of this is whenever someone gets eaten by the crocodile which is a frequent occurrence in this film no one seems to give a damn The most anyone person did in the film was to merely toast the victim in a scene which was meant to be poignant but just ended up being laughable due to the fact that the dialogue in this film was of a highly dubious nature Another thing that really irritates about this film is the fact that they introduce characters who are totally superfluous to the film itself They introduce a bunch of pirates who can only be seen to be adding another 10 minutes to a mercifully short film br br The acting can be said to be mediocre It probably would have been a lot more impressive if they did not have such a terrible script to work from All in all there isn t one person who made a terrible impact on me Every single person seemed to be a watered down caricature and in this way not one of these actors made any sort of impact on me br br The crocodile itself is said to be huge over 31 feet exactly and this sense of size is well portrayed by the obvious fake of a crocodile that they have provided for us in the film The crocodile s death at the end of the film is so ridiculously fake and contrived that it makes one s stomach turn With a huge cry of bravado the hero of the film announces that he has a plan which turns out be falling down a hill and getting the crocodile to impale himself on a luckily placed spike at the bottom of this said hill br br All in all I would say that this film is one which has to be seen for you to believe how bad it could be What probably seemed like a good idea at the time suffered from a terrible script and an overwhelming sense of low budgetness which all served to create a truly awful movie
This film is really terrible terrible as in it is a waste of 84 minutes of your life Special effects are so terrible The acting wasn t convincing br br Its about a crocodile that attack a view tourists as they are filming a documentary about blood surfing Blood surfing is when they surf around sharks but it turns terrible wrong when a 31 foot crocodile interrupts there holiday The sharks don t look real The crocodile is even worse and it gets even more pathetic when they are running away form the creature but the crocodile gets stuck and 2 females flash it The deaths are fake and the pirates are just to fill in time br br A pointless terrible film thats not worth seeing
The only real highlight in the movie is the death of the sniveling guy and the reaction of the surviving characters to it br br In every other way this film is a very lame rip off of Jaws Lake Placid and Alligator with a little bit of Godzilla 1998 thrown in br br As is standard for a 1990 s style horror movie the two non starring females each take their clothes off at least once The female lead doesn t since she obviously has a better agent br br The whole movie surrounds the filming of a really dumb extreme sport called blood surfing in which surfers cut themselves and surf in shark infested waters In this film a giant salt water crocodile also happens to be in the area People get eaten The movie ends br br I don t mind a bad horror movie but I really hate a dull bad horror movie which this definitely is
You know I can take the blood and the sex but that thong bikini shot pretty much did me in Someone get that girl some pasta before it s too late br br And you know it s just not a good idea for a schlock movie to start off by mentioning the much better movie it s ripping off br br I gave this one a 2 just because it s marginally better than Tobe Hooper s CROCODILE
Upon viewing Tobe Hooper s gem Crocodile in 2000 I developed a great interest in the college crocodile niche of the exploitation monster genre I look forward to a wayward producer to follow up with several sequels to these delightful bonbons of camp goodness If only Ed Wood could bring his subtle sense of flair and dignity to these remarkable scripts With Ed writing the scripts and a room full of monkees creating crocodile special effects on a computer all we d need would be a cast of crocky fodder with Russ Meyer breasts and Ren Hoek pectoral implants br br While Tobe Hooper s crocky opus referenced his own movies Blood Surf chose to dish out a bunch of aging themes from the chum bucket of other movies See if you can look past the Revenge of the Nerds sequel sets to find the allusions homages rip offs to Jaws Temple of Doom Indiana Jones Last Crusade The Convent Godzilla 2000 and any James Bond movie Also try to find the ready for tv fade where the editor gave up on making sense of the stock br br I was disappointed the crock didn t get to try out its sotto voce tenor with a soliloquy on environmentalism or crocky appreciation but the quasi Captain Ahab of the story does get his tour de force speach Perhaps in the coming years we ll see a crock galloping off after a shootout into a golden sunset Or hopefully a monkey will flush a crocky down the toilet of an international space station for midgets and enjoy the exploitative waltz of zero G monkey midget crocodile bloodshed br br All in all the lack of a whammy bar in the surf music irked me
Oh CGI A blessing when used properly A sin with it s used by people who have no idea what their doing Sadly that s not the only thing that s used poorly in this umpteen Jaws rip off br br Ok anybody who has read any number of my posted reviews has probably noticed 2 things 1 I like low budget horror movies And 2 If there is a cute guy in said low budget movie I ll usually point them out So let s just get this out of the way right now This is one low budget horror movie I didn t like The acting for the most part is horrible effects laughable and the script rivals Battlefield Earth as the worst I ve witnessed this year As far as the resident cute boy Dax Miller Bog wins that prize hands down This boy is hot And surprisingly he s not just a toned body with nice eyes and a cute butt he can actually act well as much as he can in this odious film Now that we have the housekeeping chores out of the way let s get on with it br br In Cliff Notes version here s the story don t worry I ll try not to give anything away br br A film crew travels to a remote island to film a documentary about two surfers established cute boy and his buddy who surf with sharks Unknown to them is a rather large salt water crocodile lurking around the island Croc shows up mayhem ensues and people are eaten Roll end credits br br As I said earlier this film pretty much blows It started pretty well but soon devolved into being silly and stupid A main character becomes lunch in a rather humorous way and our remaining heros utter one liners at the victims expense Also if this croc is at the top of the food chain on both the land and in the water what s with all the sharks around If this thing can eat a 40 foot boat I don t think a few skimpy sharks would stick around The FX is some of the worst I have ever had the displeasure to see The CGI is horrendous and they ve even managed to screw up the animatronic crocs Attention filmmakers National Geographic Discovery Store The Croc Hunter They know what crocodiles look like You obviously didn t reference any of these judging by the monstrosity seen towards the end of the film And what s with the pirate drug pusher gang Did you just need another reason to rip off a woman s top br br It s funny how we get little sub genres in the movie world With Alligator and it s sequels Lake Placid Crocodile and now Blood Surf it now looks like over sized crocodile alligator movies should now get their own category at Blockbuster Alligator was good Lake Placid was good I even thought Tobe Hooper s Crocodile was good Blood Surf sucked br br My grade D
SPOILERS br br This is one BAD movie Seriously Acting in absolutely horrible the FX are dreadfull and the plot is down right awful But hey its so bad that its fun watching The script is SO bad that its enjoyable You just have to cringe and laugh at lines such as I guess thats what you call CROCTEASING as the women flash their breasts at the crocodile I mean COME ON thats funny cause its so bad It has such horrible jokes that they re funny But after a while it just becomes to much as the movie turns into crap I really started to fall asleep Trust me though the plastic croc foot stamping on the leaves and the constant swishes of a crock tail well keep you laughing for a long time Though I have to say it had one cool part when the croc ripped that dude in half and he just hung there for a while figuring out what to do Heh heh mindless movie which HAS to be nominated for the MST3K line
I never actually thought that a film could be so atrocious but alas I was wrong Terrible acting terrible plot terrible effects The Crocodile was awful and as for the stupid sex killing scene all in one that was a bad move from the word go It was truly shocking and that is not a compliment How can someone make this film watch it back and then actually say Yeah thats a good movie People will watch that If you haven t seen it I beg you DON T BOTHER
Some might scoff but there is actually a real art with making particularly bad films This misses out on all fronts br br A bunch of young people women with heaving breasts and continuously wet T Shirts naturally go to film blood surfing and end up running into a 31 foot crocodile br br Not only was the croc obviously fake but some of the props notice the boat hitting the reef in particular look like they ve come out of thunderbirds br br No good from start to finish Don t see it
which isn t exactly a ringing endorsement Overall DinoCroc was a much better movie Sure in that movie Matt Borlenghi played a complete wuss bag who spent the entire movie crying about his little brother getting eaten by the DinoCroc But the special effects in DinoCroc were better the plot lines were better and the acting was better Here are the problems with Blood Surf 1 the killer crocodile looks like a kid s model with a retractable jaw 2 the plot is ridiculous Matt Borlenghi Co get shipwrecked on a deserted island in which they encounter a rabid group of ugly Filipino natives who try to force themselves upon the women in the group Which was a complete waste of 15 minutes of film And 3 there s not enough croc time There are a couple of redeeming qualities of Blood Surf the actresses are pretty attractive and Matt Borlenghi gets eaten by the croc towards the end of the movie But if you re on your deathbed and only have enough time to watch one Matt Borlenghi killer crocodile movie skip this one and fire up DinoCroc instead
Oh God I must have seen this when I was only 11 or twelve don t ask how I may have been young but I wasn t stupid Anyone could see that this is a bad movie nasty gross unscary and very silly I ve seen more impressive effects at Disneyland I ve seen better performances at a school play And I ve seen more convincing crocodiles at the zoo where they do nothing but sit in the water ignoring the children tapping on the glass br br The story is set in northern Australia A handful of ambitious young people are trying out a new water sport surfing in shark filled waters It soon becomes evident that something more dangerous is in the water After they learn what they get the help of a grizzly middle aged fisherman who wants to kill the animal to avenge the eating of his family br br I think I have seen every crocodile film made in the last fifteen years the best of which is Lake Placid and the worse of which is its sequel Blood Surf would have to be the second worst croc flick I think with Primeval and Crocodile tailing closely behind br br The Australian Saltwater Crododile is one of the most dangerous creatures out there resulting in more than a hundred injuries or deaths every year Movies like Blood Surf however ruin not only the ferocious image of such a creature but a good hour and a half of the viewer s life Unless you really want to see it avoid Blood Surf
It s not like that big mechanical toy says a character early on commenting on Jaws Well Blood Surf would only wish to have a beast as convincing as the shark of the Jaws series In other words the digital special effects of this movie are TERRIBLE Acting and directing are not much better either they seem more suited to a deodorant or a bubble gum commercial than to a horror movie The attitude of the people who worked on this film shows contempt not only for the genre but for the audience too Saying you liked this film only encourages filmmakers to offer us more of this crap further destroying the poor horror genre 1 2
An MTV style film crew consisting of American T V programme producer Zack Zardine Matt Borlenghi his camerawoman the Australian Cecily Kate Fisher and two surfer dudes named Bog Hall Dax Miller and Jeremy Joel West arrive on some nice looking island somewhere it s not actually revealed where The crew plan to shoot an expose on bloodsurfing which is apparently the latest craze in extreme sports Surfers throw bait into the sea and cut themselves to attract sharks just to see if they can out surf them without being eaten Once there they are greeted by Sonny Lofranco Cris Vertido and his wife Melba Susan Africa Their search for the perfect location leads them to the shark infested waters of Lilo Cay Sonny Melba and their daughter Lemmya Maureen Larrazabal take them in their boat Soon after arriving and having already shot some bloodsurfing footage Sonny Melba and Lemmya are all killed by a 30 foot saltwater crocodile that some say owns the island The boat is sunk Zack Cecily Bog and Jeremy appear stuck on the island until such time a rescue party arrives However after a run in with some erm well I don t really know what they are Pirates Drug smugglers Revolutionairies Fat ugly people who just don t like being with other people Who knows And more importantly who cares Not me that s for sure Anyway after escaping from these guys who look like pirates they are picked up just off the coast of the island by Captain John Dirks Duncan Regehr and his girl Arty Taryn Reif as Tara Reif The film crew believe they have been saved Little do they know that the crocodile and Captain Dirks go way back and he has a score to settle and four members of a film crew aren t going to stop him Captain Dirks heads back to Lilo Cay for a final showdown with the giant man eating crocodile br br Directed by James D R Hickox this is one awful film but it s still not as bad as Tobe Hoopers Crocodile 2000 Everything about this film sucks The script by Sam Bernard and Robert L Levy is terrible extremely slow as the crocodile isn t even seen or mentioned before the 30 minute mark and by that time I was seriously bored and annoyed with the hideously unlikeable characters thought up by Bernard and Levy The whole film is also frustratingly predictable as well within the first 10 minutes anyone familiar with horror film stereotypes and stock characters will be able to guess who dies and who will survive The crocodile effects are awful and seem to be repeated over and over there is a small puppet head that obviously has someones arm stuck inside it controlling it s movements as the water splashes become huge The CGI shots of the crocodile are just plain embarrassing to watch There is no gore apart from when a character is bitten in half which is achieved using CGI to digitally remove the actors legs again it looks terrible There is also a brief scene when someone is impaled on wooden spikes when they set a trap off There is a reasonable amount of nudity and sex plus the female actresses are nice and easy on the eye There are basic continuity and logical errors in the film too in one sequence Cecily is filming Bog and Jeremy bloodsurfing but from the angle and distance she is at it would be physically impossible to obtain footage of both the sharks and surfers at the same time and surely that is the whole point of her shot When Dirks manages to harpoon the crocodile the angle of the wire changes dramatically between shots in one shot the angle of the line looks like it s coming from the sky in the shot straight after the angle is completely different and it seems as if the line is coming from below the surface of the water when in actual fact the harpoon is attached to the back of the boat and the line should be almost level with the surface I could carry on like why does the crocodile jump off the edge of a cliff if it s so smart as this film tries to make out But I would probably exceed the 1000 word limit if I listed everything that was wrong with this film so I won t I hated this film but rather scarily it s still not as bad as Tobe Hoopers effort at a giant crocodile film Definitely one to avoid
A Movie about a bunch of some kind of filmmakers who want to make a documentary on a new kind of surfing in shark infested waters As an absolute fan of movies including some kind of vicious animals or monsters I thought this might be my kind of movie it wasn t This should be more of a guideline of how not to do it It has a lot of accidental humor in it and the evil beast is an incredible joke in the final scene it goes after the main characters rolling the feet are obviously waving in the air It looks ridiculous Good for a laugh though If it were only for the lack of talent between the actors the embarrassingly stupid dialogs and the hilariously stupid crocodile it would be at least worth a laugh but it gets worse I d guess the people in charge of this movie noticed how weak it was so they though up the old idea of sex sells Totally i mean TOTALLY without any reasons one of the main actresses shows her breasts to the beast And somewhere towards the beginning there s some kind of meaningless makeout This is the last ingredient making the movie absolute trash to me It s incredible how people actually spend time producing such rubbish If you are seeking for a real waste of time watch this movie
Sometimes I rest my head and think about the reasons why movies about killer sharks and or crocodiles are still getting made these days They ve been making these lame Jaws copies since the 70s it s not like they re getting any more well liked The idea is still exactly the same So we have an animal that starts murdering people First it takes down some secondary characters then it starts attacking the main characters usually played by a couple of nobodies except for someone who used to be a bit more famous who usually plays a specialist One of the main characters usually dies before the others kill the animal somehow usually with an explosion Then we usually get a last shot where we see that the animal is still alive or has laid eggs etc etc Krocodylus basically uses the same overused ideas and does absolutely nothing to create even a tad bit of variation Unless you count the fact that the specialist is a captain in this one variation in that case your standards are pretty low It s funny that he s played by Duncan Regehr though he like totally used to be Zorro Hell I ll give it a bonus point for that
Standard paint by numbers monster fare filled with a bunch of routine plot devices from big creature movies It s like somebody had a deck of cards with plot ideas from other movies written on them which were shuffled and dealt Whatever plot lines and characters came up in the deal were then tossed into the script br br Characters are so cliché ridden that you can play a game of Guess who ends up as a monster meal after less than ten minutes into the movie and probably get every single one right including the order that they will get devoured Many of the characters are so obnoxious that you root for the creature to shut them up Some of the main characters include a Billy Idol clone who surfs with sharks a loudmouth brat who flashes bankrolls a Capt Ahab guy with a vendetta and Ahab s girlfriend who does sleazy dances at a bar Oh and a big big beast in need of anger management therapy br br Along the way people argue a lot pretty girls run around with wet t shirts couples make out on exotic beaches explosions occur ruins of a shrine appear and greasy faced pirates drop by br br Amusing for the most part but one thing bothered me the callousness by characters when other people were killed After one violent demise they make one liner jokes I could almost hear rim shots br br Overall OK if you have 90 minutes to waste and you want to laugh at a so bad it s good movie Otherwise you may want to skip this one
Fans of creature feature films have to endure a lot of awful movies lately Blood Surf shamelessly joins the list of stupid redundant pulp horror titles about ridiculously big animals that want to turn the food chain upside down Crocodiles are particularly successful as we already had to struggle our way through the abysmal Crocodile directed by a disappointing Tobe Hooper and Lake Placid Blood Surf is every bit as bad as these other films and on top of that it likes to exaggerate tremendously The saltwater crocodile supposedly is 90 years old over 30 ft long and it kills for fun During the film he amuses himself by devouring a bunch of utterly stupid surfer dudes dudettes who came to seek new thrills by surfing in a shark congested area The only beautiful aspect about this film is the tropical location Even though it s a completely inappropriate setting for a film like this the lagoons and nature looks marvelous Every other aspect is simply disastrous There s a quite a bit of gore but it all looks fake and laughable The dialogues are downright painful to listen to You won t believe some of the lines these actors have to say I know surfers are supposed to be a mentally underdeveloped group but I hope for their own sake they re not that stupid Early in the film one of the characters refers to Jaws as being a mechanical toy but the croc here looks at least 10 times less real than Spielberg s great white shark The visual effects in Blood Surf are amateurish and the massacres fail to impress I won t say too much about the acting since it s secondary in flicks like this The girls look sexy in wet shirts and their boobs joyfully bounce while running away from the beast You guessed right Blood Surf is a very bad film So bad it becomes fun again But funny for a whole other reason than James Hickox intended
Seeing this movie as I just did for the first time on Turner Classic which lists it as Dangerous Female can only multiply your appreciation for the 1941 Bogart Astor version Ricardo Cortez must have been getting paid by the smirk I hope he remembered his dentist and his Brylcreem salesman in his will they made him the actor he was The women are all good but no better than that Well Una Merkel is a little better More interesting are the original Joel Cairo and Mr Gutman who competently deliver many of the individual tics but almost nothing of the set changing atmospherics of their successors in the roles Peter Lorre and Sydney Greenstreet Humphrey Bogart and Mary Astor somehow transcended the essential seediness of their characters in the remake here Sam Spade and Ruth Wonderley can t br br This movie doesn t exactly stink it lies there like a big slice of ham Its chief value today is as a reminder that great movies like the 41 Falcon don t just happen On the 1 to 10 scale I rate it a 4 mainly for the camera work and the supporting players
You get 5 writers together have each write a different story with a different genre and then you try to make one movie out of it It s action it s adventure it s sci fi it s western it s a mess Sorry but this movie absolutely stinks 4 5 is giving it an awefully high rating That said it s movies like this that make me think I could write movies and I can barely write
The special effects of this movie are especially for its time laughable and used in such an over emphasized way that you can t deny their terrible existance br br The acting redefines the term terrible overacting at the hands of Meg Foster and Richard Joseph Paul where julie Newman and Andrew Divoff just redefine bad br br spoilers br br The charm in this movie can be found in two things First is the excellent casting of Carel Lurch Struycken as the mysterious psychic Gaunt who can sense where and when people will die and is always there br br The second are original finds the combination SF Western is obviously original if terrible but other finds are more original like the gunman Zack Stone being able to sense the pain of the people he shoots though his acting falls short here br br Overal don t see this movie except if you love that ol hunk o brutal Carel Struycken as any self respecting Dutchman should
Republic pictures comes late in the game to the werewolf er Werecat genre The plot has a writer returning to Paris after a long trip abroad during which he developed jungle fear during which he had blackouts He is arriving to great acclaim as his novel that parallels an infamous trial is a best seller The French government wants to know if he had access to secret documents something that seems more likely when an official is killed by a catman Suspicion really falls on the writer when his fiancé ends up dead Complicating matters is the return of the blackouts so the writer doesn t know if he s the killer or not br br Okay thriller is much too leisurely to be fully enjoyed There are too many musical numbers early on and too much dead time when things are all talk in the middle and later sections The acting is fine and the sets quite good but there is a reason why most people I know only remember the top hatted killer he s the most interesting thing in this film despite its short running time just over an hour I think the reason that this film was rarely seen on TV was that after 20 minutes you begin to lose patience with it As good as the talk is I just wished someone would do something When it finally did happen in the closing minutes it was too little too late br br Take a pass
speaking solely as a movie i didn t really liked it not because there were no FX or because we had a single cabin as the scenario for the whole film actually that was what kept me watching it br br i didn t like it because the acting was shady his friends are all happy and then they re mad but you have no idea why then they take distinct roles one is the believer other is the antagonist but they never really make the point also the lighting was terrible and i m just mentioning technical issues br br in a few words i thing the movie could have just had a ok i m outta here from some characters like the lady who doesn t want to hear his version of the bible br br about the story itself everyone is free to write about what they want and the story is proof of some good writing and imagination i credit the book author for that hence my 4 10 br br so in the end hear the man s story believe it or not just don t spend the whole time acting like you believe him and being shocked at what he says and at the same time moving around and making jokes like you don t believe him br br Coherence br br thanks for reading
I ve seen about four other Japanese horror films and they weren t too impressive However I could sense that there was a sensible script guiding the way br br Not here no way This is about a detective who is trying to tie together similar murders that have been happening When he finds a suspect to question the suspect freaks out because they keep seeing a ghost Then the ghost starts to follow the detective around FOR A REASON THAT IS NEVER EXPLAINED AND TAKES UP MORE THAN HALF OF THE MOVIE br br Bad enough Oh no The film keeps switching perspectives to different characters who don t have much to do with the story I ve seen this before in other movies where it shows a different perspective Not the case here br br Also whatever is happening on screen that is actually tolerable quickly ends For example there a few scenes with a slight instrumental score that builds up and then it just cuts to another scene I m aware that this can be a dramatic effect That s definitely not the intention here It s just bad editing br br Finally there s the ghost who just screams in a way that s not scary or unintentionally funny It s annoying and it happens a lot throughout the movie br br All of the scares have been done before in better ways so you can see them all coming Then after one of them the movie is over At that point a wave of confusion swept over the audience as I could sense we all felt that we had wasted our time Someone did a mock clap and laughter ensued It was better than the whole film Simply put AVOID
The Japenese sense of pacing editing and musical score must be different than American tastes but surely this movie could have been so much more with a little more post production work br br Someone in Hollywood needs to re make this movie and I think it would be a big hit The story is interesting and creepy There s something about the edges of the city gritty policemen earthquakes sanitariums and mysterious saltwater killings that is enough to be captivating However this story has to make just a little bit of sense and maybe be about 40 minutes shorter br br I do have to say that the sixth sense effect was in full force in this movie and that was evident from the very beginning br br As it stands only the die hard Japanese film lovers should bother seeing this oh so boring movie
This Kiyoshi Kurosawa ghost movie is pretty wild and it did have at least one jump scare that caught me off guard But all in all the movie is incredibly stupid with a detective trying to track down a suspected serial killer only to find out he may have committed one of the crimes Then he finds himself haunted by a gorgeous Asian lady ghost and has no idea why and neither does the viewer As other murders are committed he becomes even more confused as the killers are easily found and this ghost still haunts him for some reason Not only is the plot completely stupid the lady ghost is more funny than anything especially when she suddenly flies across the city like Wonder Woman And the ending makes little sense in fact the whole movie makes little sense and I can t recommend it at all If it didn t take itself so serious I would think it was supposed to be a black comedy Outside of Bright Future this is the worst movie directed by Kiyoshi Kurosawa I have seen yet
Screenwriter Lisa Lutz began writing the screenplay at the age of 21 in 1991 br br Is she even in business If someone gave her another chance after this piece of crap she s up for the most Fortunate Person Of Ever award This movie sucks to no END It never ceases to amaze me what the turn into movies and the fact that they made this writer put it off for a bit Seriously I can write better crap than this in my sleep br br OK so how many lines to I have to type I don t get this at all I guess I m a newbie I guess I don t understand why there should ever be a limit to what anyone has to say or a quota Seriously I don t care if you have a one word sentence or even a one word response I mean c mon br br Thanks is this enough finally br br This movie is worthless
Simply put this is the worst movie since Police Academy Mission to Moscow if you liked that movie you will probably like this one br br What were they thinking Some ideas should stay just that an idea The fact that this idea could itself to film should be a criminal offense br br What was so bad about it I hear you ask One word EVERYTHING br br Cost to Hire 4 50 Cost in Time to Watch 89 Minutes br br I want a refund on both
PLAN B has the appearance of a quickly made unedited sloppy script for a movie with the attempt for an outing for the actors involved an outing that should have been nixed from the start It is just another Mafia based comedy that has nothing new and lowers the standard for those participating br br Joe Maloni Paul Sorvino is the crime boss more concerned about clothing and appearances than about his business of control His personal assistant Mario Anthony DeSando is dumber than dirt and his ignorance is supposed to be funny Maloni has whacked one of his debtors who just happens to be married to bookish Fran Diane Keaton and Maloni takes Fran on as his assistant to work off her dead husband s debt by being Maloni s hit man Fran is afraid of her own shadow and is unable to carry out Maloni s assignments electing instead to transport her whackees to Florida to hide at her brother James house until she can figure out what to do next This alternative to killing the three candidates is called Plan B Plan A being to kill them The ending is wholly predictable just as is every line assigned in the script to the characters br br Diane Keaton has made a lot of fine films and is one of our most talented actresses and comediennes but here she screams and rants and twitches her way through a ridiculous part that quickly becomes annoying to watch Paul Sorvino is well the Paul Sorvino type cast from other mobster films The supporting cast is likewise allowed to play to the balcony in the broadest slapstick pratfall fashion imaginable What is supposed to be a comedy ends up being just silly and overdone Director Greg Yaitanes needs to go back to TV sitcoms had this flimsy story been compressed into a half hour gig it might have had a chance Grady Harp
I m usually not one to say that a film is not worth watching but this is certainly an extenuating circumstance The only true upside to this film is Cornelia Sharpe looking rather attractive and the fact that this film is REALLY short br br The plot in the film is unbelievably boring and goes virtually nowhere throughout the film None of the characters are even remotely interesting and there is no reason to care about anyone I m not sure why on earth Sean Connery agreed to do this film but he should have definitely passed on this one br br The only reason I could see for seeing this film is if you are a die hard Sean Connery fan and simply want to see everything he s done Save this one for last though br br Well if you by some miracle end up seeing this despite my review or any of the other reviews on this site then I hope you enjoy it more than I did Thanks for reading
This is a case of a bunch of people thinking they are so clever they have a story that fits the time Remember the all around political conspiracies caught on camera in the years leading to the Watergate and a little later Most movies trying to cash in on made for TV o so powerful o so mind numbing conspiracies were in fact caught in their own navel gazing attitude br br I was never a fan of The Conversation which I find as much dated as others conspiracy stints of the time but Coppola was true to his main character and Hackman was a pretty engaging actor to observe I mean these conspiracy movies are mostly drowning in the character pool of noir heroes Lots of questions unanswered lots of dis communication Well this takes at least Bergman to build a movie about such un visual bases br br The Next Man is a perfect example of its time one political soup served with an idealistic character and an horrendous conspiracy tightening its web around him Neither part is interesting in itself and the whole doesn t get any better In fact you can tell how much it will be bad from the very first sequences piling up watcha that murders without ever advancing any storyline Pedestrian directing at its worst as most of the movie is one pompous accumulation of scenes revolving around violence naively brought under the viewer s eyes
The movie had a lot of potential unfortunately it came apart because of a weak implausible story line miscasting and general lack of content substance One of the very obvious flaws was that Sean Connery who played an Arab man didn t know how to pronounce his own Arab name This may seem a small flaw but it points to the seeming lack of effort in paying attention to details The quality of acting was uniformly well below average br br Movie s solitary saving grace was the twist in the plot at the very end and a french song I don t recall the title Overall it was a pretty bad movie where Sean Connery was visibly miscast
I found The Arab Conspiracy in a bargain bin and thought I d uncovered a lost treasure Folks there s a reason why you don t hear much about this film The plot is muddy the pacing is slow Cornelia Sharpe is about as vivacious as plain cold tofu and the ending leaves you flat Not even Sean Connery can save this one
When watching this show you are not quite sure whether it is the story or the acting that is more annoying First of all the storyline of each episode is very predictable the writers must have used every cliché possible you can guess not only the general plot but the arrangement of the scenes and also the lines of each character making the show some sort of a collage of every police series out there On the top of it all comes the message of the show that the good are good and the bad are bad and that at the end of the day the good shall prevail and that we should all love each other be better man and better citizens all done in the most ostensible manner The actors as the vehicles of this message and nothing more than that will use a limited set of acting skills the I am a good carrying person smile the concerned look and the victory is ours body posture while the bad guys have the I m a bad one frowning and the you caught me look followed by the I m good for nothing and I should be removed from society head banding this kind of also sums up the general development of each show True story or not the show is garbage yet another proof that producers don t give a s t about viewers that we are all thought to be idiots Well this series makes every possible attempt to idiotize the living brains out of you
Although this seems to be quite an old show 2002 I watched my first ever episode last night and I have to say it has to be the worst show ever br br I am not one for placing comments but I was so shocked that a show could exist that blatantly tries to pander to and I am only assuming that this was their target audience children under 12 years old or people with a less than average IQ br br The episode I was subjected to last night contained so many disjointed story lines tried to include EVERY possible plot summary imaginable and all the while trying to preach about friendship family religion and politics br br Basic story that they covered in the episode Frat House hazing gone wrong wrong with too much alcohol Death Turns out to be Senators son who wants FBI to investigate Death is actually murder by peanut allergy Senator thinks it could be his sworn enemy and childhood best friend who did this because Senator was taking money for his votes for legislation but eventually got a conscience and said no to mean mulit millionaire Everybody a suspect but all have the usual alibi ex girlfriend student shagging a married teacher so had to lie disgruntled student who was reported by victim actually had life changing experience Senators enemy did not pay desperate student to kill sworn enemies son he gives money freely to lots of broke students All the while the heroine of this dribble has her niece staying who is at that age and has a crush on a boy who she eventually gets the courage to talk to with the assistance of her aunty but only to dump him because the in girls says he is not good enough and so to keep in with them she dumps him Don t worry she gets back with boy after she learns the truth about life and the in girls drop her Aunty also explains that God is the only one who truly she can rely on I was almost sick at this point br br This drama gets even better when Sue and her FBI team find out who the killer is your gonna laugh at this i sure did br br It is one of the Frat boys who only a year ago found out he was adopted and that his real dad is an International terrorist and he is trying to impressive real daddy by killing boy and planting bomb at funeral br br The characters are cardboard the acting is cardboard the continuity is cardboard the story is cardboard Anybody who says that they love this show has cardboard for a brain br br Why the writers of this show have tried to pack in EVERY eventuality into the one show means that they obviously have no faith in the character development or actors capability to carry off a simple plot line Watching this show is like watching Last Action Hero with Arnie killing 5 000 people with a tooth pick except Arnie is a better actor wow never thought there would be a day that i would say that br br In the words of the Simpsons beloved character comic book guy br br WORST TV SHOW EVER
I saw one of the stage performances in Denver and have never been less impressed The word vagina says it all A body part Nothing shocking here I could say to my doctor My left arm has been hurting a bit after tennis or My vagina hurts after cycling with equal or more social commentary It could be the Tricep Monologues for all the entertainment or radical comment I heard The monologues were dull but delivered with drama the topics were outdated and I was alternately bored and annoyed Once I think I laughed but apparently it wasn t when I was supposed to Surely this isn t really a hit Oh and spoilers there was a LESBIAN oh wait maybe not come to think of it And Inappropriate Fondling And a Crack Mama That about covers it
Hearing such praise about this play I decided to watch it when I stumbled across it on cable I don t see how this elivates women and their struggles by focusing on the topic at hand I guess if you have an interest in stories about women s private parts and how it affects their lives then this is for you Otherwise it s rather dull and boring If anything I found it a bit degrading br br I inquired with a female friend who also watched this and she thought it was horrible as well So it s not just a guy not getting it
This was one of the most boring horror movies that I have ever seen A college kid has an epidemic of nightmares involving roaming spirits at Alcatraz Trying to deliver a mix of Nightmare on Elm Street and standard vampire fare in the form of a bad 80s music video this movie is jammed full of bad acting and an exhaustively slow moving story Although being such a bad and often laughable movie dig those mullets and the terrible dialog it would be good material to spoof on for an episode of Mystery Science Theater 3000 Don t be fooled by the proud mention of the film being the 1987 winner of the Silver Scroll Award by the Academy of Sicence Fiction Fanatasy and Horror or that Devo contributes to the soundtrack or that Tony Basil has a part in the film It is a giant disaster though one with a small cult following see the other IMDb comments for this film
College student Alex Gardner Nicholas Celozzi is plagued by nightmares of a cellar dwelling ghoul at Alcatraz He dreams of cutting off his own hand spitting up a worm a ghoul ripping open his chest and being roasted over an open fire After his friends see him levitating 6 feet over his bed a helpful occult obsessed teacher Donna Denton suggests that they sneak into Alcatraz to face his fears Of course they go in the middle of the night when no one is around to help when things get out of hand br br The group become stranded Alex s brother Richard Tom Reilly becomes possessed and starts killing everyone Toni Basil of Mickey fame shows up as the helpful ghost of Sammy Mitchell lead singer of the group Bodybag She teaches Alex how to levitate out of his body and does a rock music dance intercut with repeat nightmare footage to pad out the running time All of the victims show up as wisecracking ghosts a la the Griffin Dunne character in AN AMERICAN WEREWOLF IN LONDON The script is full of plot holes cheesy dialogue and lame attempts at comedy Good FX work and cool opening credits both by Ernest D Farino are the only things gaining any merit Basil and Devo Whip It do some songs on the soundtrack br br Score 2 out of 10
Well after three times through I still have no idea what this movie is about because quite honestly it failed to generate any real interest or concern But here it goes A bunch of too old to be teen Teen Actors dressed in horrifying latter 1980 s fashions did WE look like that too decide it would be a really good idea to get in a motorboat and go visit the abandoned Alcatraz after one of them has nightmares of people being slaughtered in various horrifying ways that manage to rip off POLTERGEIST THE EVIL DEAD and Freddy Kreuger in one fell swoop The dimwit even envisions himself being roasted over an open fire with some deformed freak slicing off strips of tenderloin Good thing it was only a dream or it might have hurt and good thing his dreams had a decent special effects budget Mine are usually pretty lame Girls model space ships blowing things up with a bazooka etc br br Once on the Alcatraz island they find themselves in a Slasher movie and meet up with Tony Basil who cannot help but break into a couple dance poses at times and had her own lighting crew complete with a smoke machine for that 1980 s smoky haze infused light look which I kind of miss And such reminded me that Ms Basil helped choreograph David Byrne of the Talking Heads for some of his videos and performances This of course has nothing at all to do with the film but kept popping into mind as the movie posed very little to actually think about It sort of happens and you can either watch or keep working on your page markup with it on the TV set off to the side But since the film isn t really interesting you ll keep deciding to finish one last thing instead of wasting time the movie will keep ending and you ll find yourself wondering what you missed every time you realize the end credits are starting to roll again dammit br br SOME 1980 s Teen Horror movies can survive such specialized viewing Umberto Lenzi s GHOSTHOUSE CHOPPING MALL it s Killbots the hard to ignore NIGHT OF THE CREEPS and the over the top SLEEPAWAY CAMP all come to mind They are films that like them or not demand your attention and usually pay off with some good gore or T A and typos in your work as evidence that you were watching the TV instead of your keyboard I am sure that HELL ISLAND as the British version I glommed onto is titled does indeed have some good stuff in there but frankly I don t care And nothing is more annoying that encountering art of any genre that doesn t inspire admiration some decent dislike or even good old honest hatred for it The film is content with simpering away 80 whatever minutes of time and never really accomplishing anything more than being a sometimes distraction in spite of my best efforts to try and give it a chance but no dice br br There is some offbeat production design going on the use of lighting is striking at times and the occasional outburst of mayhem will probably keep fans of 1980 s Teen Horror interested The rest of you be warned though YOU WILL WONDER IF YOU DRESSED LIKE THAT IN 1987 and the answer is probably more hideous than anything which happens on screen Try to watch it as a free rental if possible so that if disappointed you aren t stuck with the damn thing Movies like this take up valuable shelf space that is often at a commodity these days what with the world coming to an end all
The storyline is absurd and lame also sucking are performances and the dialogue is hard to keep your Eyes open I advise you to have a caffeine propelled friend handy to wake you in time for a couple Gore effects Why they bring Alcatraz in In this case becomes increasingly difficult to swallow All the while i wondered who this film aimed for Chock full of lame subplots such as the Cannibalism US Army captain This is low grade in every aspect BTW this Movie is banned in Germany
The summary provided by my cable TV guide made it sound a lot more interesting than it actually is Slaughterhouse Rock is by far the worst horror film that I have ever seen a title previously held by Urban Legends Final Cut From its opening scene I could tell it s going to be really bad but I was so bored that I couldn t care less This film contains laughable acting especially by the guy who s tormented in his dreams incredible as in not credible plot twists and some of the crappiest music I ve heard and I m living in a period when the likes of Britney Spears and Nsync dominate the air waves The biggest problem with Slaughterhouse Rock is that it s not funny One would a film as dull and boring and so NOT scary as this would try to spice things up a bit with a few funny one liners here and there but no We have Tormented Guy s self centered friend trying to be funny but came across as annoying instead spoiler And please do tell me who in this crazy world is insane and self loathing enough to visit a creepy jail in the middle of the night No one If you re going to make a horror movie at least make it believable This one is anything but
The late 80 s saw an inexplicable rash of supernatural horror films set in gloomy penitentiary settings Renny Harlin s superbly gritty and moody Prison got the whole haunted hoosegow ball rolling it was immediately followed by the markedly inferior The Chair John Saxon s enjoyably trashy Death House the passable psycho picture Destroyer and this hideously limp n lethargic exercise in hopelessly comatose tedium br br Your usual annoying collection of horribly unsympathetic college student chowderheads lead by insufferably spineless tormented twerp Alex the hugely unappealing Nicholas Celozzi go to Alcatraz Island to investigate the bizarre circumstances surrounding the sudden gruesome death of up and coming rock star Sammy Mitchell blandly played by Toni Basil of Hey Micky fame Alex s brother becomes possessed by the evil demonic spirit of a vicious cannibalistic US Civil War cavalry commandant and goes on the expected killing spree thus forcing wimpy Alex to overcome his passivity and make a stand against this ghoulish specter br br Although slickly photographed by Nicholas Von Sternberg with a few decent gore set pieces and a fair amount of spooky atmosphere the film was shot on location in the dismal rusty rundown ruins of Alcatraz Island Slaughterhouse rock nonetheless just doesn t cut it as a solid effective fright feature This is largely due to the uniformly obnoxious and unlikeable collegiate smartaleck characters a tiresomely smirky bunch whose inane comic antics prove to be grating rather than amusing The flat acting from a noticeably disinterested cast hurts matters all the more with onetime Playboy playmate and undeniable blonde cutie pie hottie supreme Hope Marie Carlton doing an especially irritating Linnea Quigley impersonation as the token oversexed nympho bimbo Dimitri Logothetis direction displays a modicum of flashy visual style but the tone is unevenly pitched between grim seriousness and goofy horrendously sophomoric silliness and most damagingly Ted Landon s sloppy inconsistent overly complicated and finally quite confusing script miserably fails to develop the necessary internal logic to make the far fetched story even remotely plausible In other words this stinker sadly succeeds in making a scant 90 minutes seem like an excruciatingly drawn out cinematic jail sentence
Making the film as dark and visually fuzzy as possible in order to cover up the budget deficiencies is an often used strategy in low budget horror films but this one takes it too far It is SO poorly lit and murky and it takes place almost entirely at night to boot that you often end up virtually looking at a black screen although perhaps the bad video transfer may also have had something to do with that Alas murky is also the best word to describe the movie s plot The filmmakers throw in diverse and unoriginal horror ideas without any semblance of logic and halfway through you get the feeling that they just about abandoned the effort to make a good horror film you know it when you see characters who are supposed to be in mortal danger or in some occasions even dead making small talk 1 2
I m gettin sick of movies that sound entertaining in a one line synopsis then end up being equal to what you d find in the bottom center of a compost heap br br Who knows Witchery may have sounded interesting in a pitch to the studios even with a big name cast like Blair and Hasselhoff wink wink nudge nudge and the effervescent likes of Hildegard Knef I dunno some woman br br But on film it just falls apart faster than a papier mache sculpture in a rainstorm Seems these unfortunate folks are trapped in an island mansion off the Eastern seaboard and one of them a woman I d guess is being targeted by a satanic cult to bear the child of hell while the others are offed in grotesque tortuous ways br br Okay right there you have a cross section of plots from The Exorcist The Omen Ten Little Indians and a few other lesser movies in the satanic worshippers run amok line None of it is very entertaining and for the most part you ll cringe your way from scene to scene until it s over br br No not even Linda Blair and David Hasselhoff help matters much They re just in it to pick up a paycheck and don t seem very intent on giving it their all br br From the looks of it Hasselhoff probably wishes he were back on the beack with Pam Anderson and who can blame him and Linda well who knows a celebrity PETA benefit or pro am golf tour or whatever it is she s in to nowadays br br And the torture scenes Ecchhhh You ll see people get their mouths sewn shut dangled up inside roaring fireplaces strung up in trees during a violent storm vessels bursting out of their necks etc etc Sheesh and I thought Mark of the Devil was the most sadistic movie I d seen br br Don t bother It s not worth your time I can t believe I told you as much as I did If you do watch it just see if you can count the cliches And yes Blair gets possessed as if you didn t see THAT coming down Main Street followed by a marching band br br No stars Witchery these witches will give you itches
I and a friend rented this movie We both found the movie soundtrack and production techniques to be lagging The movie s plot appeared to drag on throughout with little surprise in the ending We both agreed that the movie could have been compressed into roughly an hour giving it more suspense and moving plot
Humm an Italian movie starred by David hasselhoff and Linda Blair I wasn t expecting very much to be honest and in fact I took even less than I was expecting It doesn t mean this movie is the worst I have seen because I have watched worse things than this but the plot was most of the times confusing and uninteresting and some good gore scenes are the only thing saving this Apart from that you are going to love some special effects they are really cheesy and bad Now I only want to watch Troll 3 by this same director sure it is not going to be worse than that
We brought this film as a joke for a friend and could of been our worst joke to play The film is barely watchable and the acting is dire The worst child actor ever used and Hasslehoff giving a substandard performance The plot is disgraceful and at points we was so bored we was wondering what the hell was going on It tries to be gruesome in places but is just laughable br br Just terrible
This only gets bashed because it stars David Hasselhoff Well then let me bash it to Compared to the garbage they call horror coming out nowadays this film isn t too bad It has the beautiful Leslie Cumming She is super hot but can t talk very well There is a great scene with her when she is supernaturally raped She shows off her nice body Linda Blair does nothing here as well as Hasselhoff 3 10
I watched this movie purely for the setting It was filmed in an old hotel that a friend owns shares of The plot was predictable the acting was mediorcre at best the scares were all gross outs not true scares br br I don t remember much of the plot and I think that s because there wasn t much of one to remember They didn t even use the hotel to it s fullest potential The beaches are fantastic and the hotel is situated on a peninsula At low tide you can walk almost 1 4 mile into the bay which is actually an eerie sight first thing in the morning or late at night when the wind is howling through the cracks br br The best way to see this movie is with the remote in your hand so you can fast forward through the action and I m using that term loosly scenes and pause at the beauty of the surroundings
This film features two of my favorite guilty pleasures Sure the effects are laughable the story confused but just watching Hasselhoff in his Knight Rider days is always fun I especially like the old hotel they used to shoot this in it added to what little suspense was mustered Give it a 3
A really very bad movie with a very few good moments or qualities br br It starts off with pregnant Linda Blair who runs down a hallways to flee what might be monsters or people with pitchforks I m not sure She jumps through a window and wakes up and we see she is very pregnant The degree to which she is pregnant varies widely throughout the movie br br She and an annoying and possibly retarded little boy who I thought was her son travel to an abandoned hotel on an island Italian horror directors find the most irritating little boys to put in their movies On the island already are David Hasselhoff and his German speaking virgin girlfriend you know how Germans are said to love Hasselhoff He s taking photographs and she s translating an esoteric German book about witches I think br br Also traveling to the island are an older couple who have purchased it and a real estate agent and a woman I thought was their daughter Evidently she was an architect and Linda Blair and the boy are the older couple s children I guess they all traveled to the island together but it really seemed like Linda and the boy were apart from the rest of them maybe they were filmed separately br br The hotel seems neat certainly from the exteriors but it isn t used to any great effect An old woman in bad makeup and a black cloak keeps appearing to the boy and chants something in German sometimes which he eventually records on his Sesame Street tape recorder br br People start getting killed either in their dreams or sucked into hell or something Some of these gore scenes are OK but not enough to recommend the movie Though the copy I watched stated it is uncut on the box cover the death of one character whose veins explode really seems to have been cut Much of the scene is showing another character s reaction shots since we re not seeing anything ourselves The creepiest scene is one in which a man or demon with a really messy looking wound of a mouth rapes someone He looked particularly nasty There s a laughably and painfully bad scene in which Linda Blair is possessed I wish if a horror movie is going to cast her they would do something original with her role and let her leave Exorcist behind her except for the yearly horror conventions br br In the weird largely Italian tradition of claiming to be a sequel to something it is unrelated to this is also AKA La Casa 4 and Ghosthouse 2 That is it is supposedly a sequel to Casa 3 Ghosthouse La 1988 it s not that s also a better movie than this one La Casa 1 and two were The Evil Dead 1981 and Evil Dead II 1987 again unrelated to Witchery and La Casa 3 and much better than those There s also a Casa 5 La 1990 AKA House 5 which seems to want to be a sequel to the fake La Casa series and the series House House 1986 House II The Second Story 1987 The Horror Show 1989 AKA House III and House IV 1992 How s The Horror Show fit in there It doesn t really it claimed to be a sequel thus requiring the real series entry to renumber itself to cause less or more confusion Oddly The Horror Show is also AKA Horror House and La Casa 5 is also AKA Horror House 2 Does your head hurt yet
Witchy Hildegard Knef traps a group of people in an isolated hotel and picks them off one by one in twisted disgusting ways I thought I d seen it all until one unfortunate man here is crucified and then has his head set on fire Hildy is quite the prankster too she takes a nagging harpy and sews her mouth shut then hangs her upside down in the chimney just in time for a roaring fire Witchery made me sick It made my eyes hurt I was ready to write it off as the worst movie ever ever ever made by otherwise competent people until the finale I have to admit I loved the ending It involves a boy and his toy tape recorder cornered by Linda Blair looking fantastically possessed The scene only lasts for about a minute and the movie s over but you know that old saying If you ve got a great ending people will forgive you for just about anything
Witchery might just be the most incoherent and lamentably scripted horror movie of the 80 s but luckily enough it has a few compensating qualities like fantastic gore effects an exhilarating musical score and some terrific casting choices Honestly the screenplay doesn t make one iota of sense but who cares when Linda Blair with an exploded hairstyle portrays yet another girl possessed by evil powers and David Hasselhof depicts a hunky photographer who can t seem to get laid in a movie that constantly features bloody voodoo sewn shut lips upside down crucifixions vicious burnings and an overused but genuinely creepy tune Eight random people are gathered together on an abandoned vacation resort island off the coast of Massachusetts The young couple is there to investigate the place s dark history the dysfunctional family with a pregnant Linda Blair even though nobody seems to bother about who the father is and what his whereabouts are considers re opening the hotel and the yummy female architect simply tagged along for casual sex They re forced to stay the night in the ramshackle hotel and then suddenly the previous landlady an aging actress or something who always dresses in black starts taking them out in various engrossing ways Everything is somehow related to the intro sequence showing a woman accused of witchery jump out of a window Anyway the plot is definitely of minor importance in an Italian horror franchise that started as an unofficial spin off of The Evil Dead The atmosphere is occasionally unsettling and the make up effects are undoubtedly the most superior element of the entire film There s something supremely morbid and unsettling about staring at a defenseless woman hanging upside down a chimney and waiting to get fried
Witchcraft Witchery La Casa 4 and whatever else you wish to call it How about Crud br br A gathering of people at a Massachusetts island resort are besieged by the black magic powers of an evil witch killing each individual using cruel torturous methods Photographer Gary David Hasselhoff is taking pictures for Linda Catherine Hickland whose voice and demeanor resemble EE YOR of the Winnie the Poo cartoon a virgin studying witchcraft on the island resort without permission Rose Brooks Annie Ross portraying an incredibly rude bitch is interested in perhaps purchasing the resort and along with husband Freddie Robert Champagne who is always ogling other women much younger than him pregnant daughter Jane Linda Blair and grandson Tommy Michael Manchester who just looks bored throughout probably wanting to watch Sesame Street instead of starring in this rubbish go by boat to the resort being treated to a look at the property by Realtor Tony Giordano s son Jerry Rick Farnsworth obviously a pup in the business getting his feet wet Along with these folks is architect Leslie Leslie Cumming whose character is a nympho who might help Rose re design the resort The boat s captain is killed by The Lady in Black Hildegard Knef wearing her make up and lip stick extra thick and a storm is brewing The boat drives off by itself guided by the invisible power of The Lady in Black I guess with everyone stuck in the decrepit resort which is in dire need of repairs Most of the victims before meeting their grisly fates are carried through a type of red wormhole whose vortex leads to another dimension perhaps a type of hell or something where they are tortured by these fiends dressed in raggedy clothes with a crummy visage One victim has her mouth sown before being hung upside down in a chimney roasted as the others light the fireplace One poor soul is tortured by harsh twistings of rope wrapped tightly around her flesh before being found hanging from the snout of a swordfish penetrating through her neck One fellow is slowly suffocating as his veins bulge and bleed and neck s blood vessels burst squirting in Hasselhoff s face One fellow is crucified with nails hammered into his hands before being hung upside down over an open flame Blair s pregnant victim becomes possessed with her hair standing on end speaking in another woman s voice One is raped by this demonic man with a diseased mouth as the hellish hobos stand nearby gleefully cheering The film despite it s excesses is mostly dull fodder for those who really wish to see the lowest point in the careers of Hasselhoff and Blair who deserve better than this Almost unbearable at times building little to no suspense Clumsy execution of the death sequences which look cheap and laughable Sure some gore is okay but most of the film shows victims after they ve been run through the ringer We do get a chance to see pregnant women who look exactly like stuntmen in costume with bad wigs jumping out three story windows Oh and The Lady in Black s reflected face often pops up on inanimate objects for characters to see Tommy has a little Sesame Street recorder which tapes The Lady in Black s mumbo jumbo chants obviously used for later For some reason The Lady in Black likes to visit little Tommy He s not at all scared of her for Tommy s just too bored to show any expression on his face much less fear Need I say more This one s a real stinker Ugh
There are many different versions of this one floating around so make sure you can locate one of the unrated copies otherwise some gore and one scene of nudity might be missing Some versions also omit most of the opening sequence and other bits here and there The cut I saw has the on screen title WITCHCRAFT EVIL ENCOUNTERS and was released by Shriek Show who maintain the original US release title WITCHERY for the DVD release It s a nice looking print and seems to have all of the footage but has some cropping aspect ratio issues In Italy it was released as LA CASA 4 WITCHCRAFT The first two LA CASA releases were actually the first two EVIL DEAD films retitled and the third LA CASA was another film by the same production company Filmirage which is best known here in America as GHOSTHOUSE To make matters even more confusing WITCHERY was also released elsewhere as GHOSTHOUSE 2 Except in Germany where GHOSTHOUSE 2 is actually THE OGRE DEMONS 3 OK I better just shut up now I m starting to confuse myself br br Regardless of the title this is a very hit or miss horror effort Some of it is good some of it isn t I actually was into this film for the first half or so but toward the end it became a senseless mess A large vacant hotel located on an island about 50 miles from Boston is the setting as various people get picked off one by one by a German speaking witch Hildegard Knef Photographer Gary David Hasselhoff who wants to capture Witch Light and his virginal writer girlfriend Leslie Cumming who is studying witchcraft are shacking up at the hotel without permission Along comes real estate agent Jerry Rick Farnsworth who s showing off the property to potential buyers Rose Annie Ross and Freddie Robert Champagne Brooks Also tagging along are their children pregnant grown daughter Jane Linda Blair and very young son Tommy Michael Manchester as well as oversexed architect Linda Sullivan Catherine Hickland Hasselhoff s wife at the time Once everyone is inside their boat driver is killed hung and the boat disappears so they find themselves trapped and basically at the mercy of the Lady in Black br br So what can you expect to find here Plenty of unpleasantries One of the characters has their lips sewn shut and is then hung upside down in the fireplace and accidentally slow roasted by the rest of the cast There s also a crucifixion witches eating a dead baby a swordfish through the head someone set on fire a possession a Sesame Street tape recorder the virgin getting raped by some demon a guys veins bulging and exploding thanks to voodoo doll pokes and some other stuff From a technical standpoint it s a nice looking film with pretty good cinematography a decent score and good gore effects The hotel island setting is also pretty nice Blair particularly at the end and Ross both seem like they re having fun and Knef is great as the evil witch Even though people like to ridicule Hasselhoff these days he s not bad in his role either br br On the down side despite all the gore the film seems somewhat dull and it gets monotonous after about an hour The supernatural themes are muddled and confusing too When characters are being swept into the witches lair to be tortured and killed the filmmakers unwisely decided to superimpose the screaming actors over some silly looking red spiral vortex effect that looks supremely cheesy And the witch lair itself is vacant and cheaply designed with unfinished lumber And while most of the cast is at least decent a few of the performances particularly the actress who plays Hasselhoff s girlfriend and the kid are so bad they re constantly distracting
Oh my bad clothing worse synth music and the worst David Hasselhoff The 80 s are back with vengeance in Witchery an American Italian co production helmed by infamous Joe D Amato on the production side and short careered director thank heavens for small miracles Fabrizio Laurenti directing Marketed as a kind of sequel to Sam Raimi s Evil Dead series in Italy that was dubbed La Casa in there Witchery delivers some modest gore groceries and bad acting br br A mix of ghost story possessions and witchcraft the film bounces clueless from scene to another without letting some seriously wooden actors and hilarious day and night mix ups slow it s progress to expectable ending topped with some serious WTF surprise climax I just love the look on her face Surprisingly Laurenti manages to gather some suspense and air of malice in few very few scenes unluckily for him these few glimpses of mild movie magic go down quickly and effectively br br The plus sides are experienced when the gore hits the fan This department is quite effective and entertaining in that classic latex and red paint style of the 80 s Italo gore when things were made 100 hand made and as shockingly and vivid as modest budgets could allow I could only watch with sadistic glee and few laughters all the over the top ways that obnoxious characters and actors got mangled and misused one by one I only felt sorry for Linda Blair who apparently haven t been let to try any other than that good old possessed girl woman role ever in his career or so it looks like when checking out his filmography br br Well folks not much more to tell and even less to tell home about Don t expect too much when spending some rainy afternoon with this and probably you ll experience at least some mild fun It also helps if your rotten little heart pounds in the beat of 80 s euro gore horror And speaking of hearts every movie that has David Hasselhoff getting skewered by a sizeable metal object and bleeding heavily around the room and corridors MUST have it s one on the right place br br This is my truth what is yours
An Italian American co production co starring Linda Blair and David The Hoff Hasselhoff how could any fan of trashy horror resist such a treat br br Well based on the uneventful extremely tedious and utterly nonsensical first forty minutes or so I would have said very easily thankfully however things do eventually get a tad more entertaining with the introduction of several inventive death scenes and for those lucky enough to find an uncut copy a smattering of nudity too unfortunately my copy was optically edited to remove such offensive material br br The Hoff stars as Gary a photographer who accompanies his beautiful girlfriend Leslie Leslie Cumming to a run down hotel on a seemingly deserted island in order to take pictures for her latest project a book about witches whilst there frustrated Gary also hopes to try and cure a bad case of blue balls by relieving Leslie of her virginity br br His plans for nookie are scuppered however by the unexpected arrival of property developers Freddie and Rose Brooks Robert Champagne and Annie Ross their pregnant daughter Jane Blair son Tommy Michael Manchester pretty nymphomaniac architect Linda Sullivan Catherine Hickland and estate agent Jerry Rick Farnsworth who have come to inspect the island s hotel br br After explaining their unexpected presence on the island Gary and Leslie are welcomed by the property s new owners and when a violent storm suddenly picks up making it perilous to return to the mainland everyone agrees to spend the night in the old building Unfortunately unbeknownst to the hotel s new guests the place is also home to the spirit of an evil witch Hildegard Knef who requires human sacrifices in order to bring herself back to life One by one victims are pulled into a swirling red vortex which is guaranteed to provide unintentional laughs before meeting a terrible fate br br None of this makes much sense and the acting is atrocious Manchester as Tommy is particularly bad whilst Hasselhoff proves to be one of the better performers which speaks volumes about the others but those viewers who make it past the dreary first half are rewarded with some pretty decent moments of gore Rose has her lips sewn together before being roasted alive in a fireplace Jerry is crucified and burnt alive Linda is tortured by hags and impaled on a swordfish Freddie s veins pulsate and erupt in geysers of blood and Gary gets stabbed in the back br br Oh and Leslie is raped by a guy with no lips and Blair gets possessed again
This movie is so bad it s good in an unintentionally funny way I couldn t stop watching it I was laughing so much It s like a parody of a romantic thriller except it s not a parody br br Alexandra Paul plays Emily Wendell an oppressed preacher s wife who falls hard for Luke Corey Sevier a hunky and mysterious drifter who we eventually learn was in prison the only thing Sevier is guilty of though is bad acting Mind you he s no worse than the other actors You get the sense that the actors have no idea they re in a really awful film they re playing it straight Everything about the film is bad the acting the script the love scenes the pacing the plot twists the choice of music The climactic scenes are just so ludicrous first the shootout in the church then Luke s final words to Emily I was howling with laughter br br Evidently Luke did a lot of weight lifting and ab crunches in prison and we get to see plenty of his naked torso That s probably the highlight of the film
I watched this movie last week sometime and had the biggest laugh i ve had in a long while The plot of the film is pretty dumb and convoluted in a badly crafted way The only plus to be found anywhere in the film are Corey Savier s impressive abs Alexandra Paul i think that s her name is horrendous as the preacher s wife who has a history of depression Ted McKenzie is gross and his character s a twit on top of it all And as if the fact that you think she s having sex with her son isn t enough they throw in needless sax solos at every opportunity The end and climax of this film is absolutely abysmal and also laughable I mean who the hell wants to carry the child of a con who tried to make you think he was your son and that you were having an incestuous relationship with him
I am watching this movie right now on WTN because that was the channel that the TV was turned to when I turned it on It is a not very credible and fairly boring story about a minister s wife Alexandra Paul falling in lust with a young stud drifter with washboard abs played by Corey Sevier There may or may not be a plot Corey whips his shirt off a lot and Alexandra swoons I m getting the feeling he s supposed to be up to no good and that s why he s messing with skinny Alexandra Paul It s not really important because as I said he takes his shirt off a lot and I just caught a glimpse of butt cleavage There s a lot of sax on the soundtrack which is just painful
This film is a pure failure I am a Steve Martin fan but even he can t save the tired idea and swiss cheese script Think Police Academy 7 and apply it to a military parody Yuck br br I DO NOT feel the other user comments reflected the poor rating this film received and rightfully deserved It is extremely misleading I have often seen this film marked down to 3 00 in the grocery store and now I certainly know why br br If only I could get my 90 minutes back
When I say Doctor Who you might conjure up an image of Tom Baker or Jon Pertwee or maybe Peter Davison When I say James Bond you ll almost certainly conjure up an image of Sean Connery while a small handful of people may think of Roger Moore or Pierce Brosnan But when I say Sgt Bilko absolutely everyone will think of Phil Silvers Unlike Doctor Who or James Bond the role belongs exclusively to one actor And that s the problem with this film version you ll continually wish you were watching the old black and white show In fact the whole idea of making a film version of BILKO without Silvers in the title role comes close to sacrilage
Even Steve Martin and Dan Aykroyd couldn t save this movie from laying an emu sized egg Based on the classic Phil Silvers TV series it bombed because A It was updated to the 1990s and B The simple premise of the TV series was turned into a confusing feeble and silly screenplay br br The original TV series used a small cast of talented actors to portray lovable characters acting out simple yet hilarious pranks To expand this premise into a 1990s movie was asking for trouble and it shows No one could pay me enough to sit through this stinker a second time
This was a disappointing movie Considering the material army life is always good for a laugh and the stars this movie should have been a fall down laughfest It was worth a couple of chuckles at best Steve Martin has been much funnier than this and it appears that Dan Ackroyd should stick to dramatic roles where he might follow Robin Williams lead and someday win an Oscar
Steve Martin should quit trying to do remakes of classic comedy He absolutely does not fit this part Like the woeful remake of the Out Of Towners this movie falls flat on it s face How anybody ever thought Steve Martin could even come close to Jack Lemmon s wonderful performance is beyond me and the same is true for this movie Dan Ackroyd could have played the Bilko part better Martin is great when doing his own original characters but fails miserably trying to recreate other people s classic work It s a sad statement when the funniest part of a movie is contained in the first line of the credits when the movie is over The line The producers gratefully acknowledge the total lack of cooperation by the United States Army was just about the only line that actually made me laugh If you want to see the real Bilko get hold of the original episodes of the Phil Silvers Show Those are guaranteed to make you laugh unlike this mistake that should never have happened I put this movie in the same category as the aforementioned Lemmon classic and the remake of Psycho None of them should ever have happened
I know I ve already added a comment but I just wanted to clarify something br br I m not some old fogey from the Baby Boom generation that grew up glued to a flickering b w picture of Phil Silvers Jackie Gleason etc br br Bilko was already 20 years old before I was born but I had the pleasure of discovering Phil Silver s Bilko courtesy of BBC2 I wonder if I would have enjoyed Steve Martin s travesty if I hadn t seen or heard of Phil Silvers I don t know maybe I would have br br Some of the other reviewers who think this movie is worthy of a 10 admit that they haven t seen the original I can only urge you to spend 21 minutes of your life watching a single episode If after watching the original Ernie Colonel Hall Ritzig Emma Duane Doberman Henshaw Dino Flashman Zimmerman Mullin et al you still think that Steve Martin s film is woth anything above a 2 I ll stand you a pint

This may or may not be the worst movie that Steve Martin has ever made but it certainly was far from his best Obviously he did this crap for the pay check Dreck like this certainly does nothing to enhance his reputation as a funny man What he doesn t seem to grasp is that when people go to see a Steve Martin movie they expect to be entertained not bored to tears It s sad that he dragged Dan Aykroyd and Phil Hartman down with him I don t understand why talented people can t get a grip on the fact that people don t want to see them in lousy movies If you re going to call a movie a comedy then it should be funny This wasn t Shame on the US military for allowing itself to be associated with this pabulum too Full Metal Jacket had more laughs than this miserable excuse for a service comedy Surely Phil Silvers is rolling over in his grave
Maybe I m really getting old but this one just missed me and the old Funny Bone completely Surely there must be something powerful wrong with this Irishman that s me Schultz Lordy lordy what I would give to see the light Firstly that Phil Silvers manic energy wit and drive was very much a part of the comedic upbringing and overall education in life if you will Although it is possible that the series first titled YOU LL NEVER GET RICH 1955 59 could have gotten on the CBS TV Network with someone else in the title role of Sgt Bilko it is very hard to picture any other Actor Comedian in the business wearing those Master Sergeant s stripes br br Such a strong identification is inescapable though not the same sort of career wrecking typecasting of a nightmare that it proved to be to some other guys like Clayton More THE LONE RANGER George Reeves THE ADVENTURES OF SUPERMAN and Charles Nelson Riley UNCLE CROC S BLOCK br br One major stumbling block to successfully adapting and updating such a work from the 1950 s TV Screen to the 1990 s Movie going public is our collective memory Without being sure about what percentage of the crowd remembered the Bilko character from seeing the original run and early syndication revivals and their numbers were surely considerable even a large segment of the young had seen Bilko reruns in recent times It was obvious that the new film and the source were miles or even light years apart br br So as not to be thought of as a totally square old grouch please let s consider some other points br br Right here today the 14th Day of November In The Year of Our Lord 2007 let me swear and affirm under Oath that I have been a Steve Martin fan for nearly 30 years Furthermore I ve enjoyed the wit and talents of Bilko 96 Co Stars Dan Akroyd and the Late Phil Hartman After all it was the talents of guys like this and so many others Alumni of NBC s Saturday NIGHT and SECOND CITY TV that kept the last quarter of the 20th Century laughing But a BILKO re make it just didn t click br br Perhaps if the film had been made as a Service Comedy always liked em but without the Bilko Show names and gave it some identity of it self it would be more highly regarded by crabby old guys like me br br So we ve already had so many sitcom and cartoon series turned into movies lately what s next Howse about somebody doing Hal Roach s World War II Army Comedy Series of Sergeants DOUBLEDAY AMES and TV s 1st Cartoon Series CRUSADER RABBIT Remember where you heard it first POODLE SCHNITZ
OK I m not an American but in my humble Scottish opinion Steve Martin is not never has been and never will be a funny man as long as our posteriors point in a southerly direction Phil Silvers as Sergeant Bilko was a funny man no doubt due to the skilled writers and directors and all the other talented team working characters in the series who contributed perfectly to one of the funniest and dateless situation comedies America has ever produced How anyone could have the audacity to even attempt to replicate the Phil Silvers character is beyond me To compound things the exercise was repeated in Martin s unfunny attempt to be Peter Seller s Inspector Clouseau another abortive attempt in my opinion to rekindle a demonstrably unfunny career Some of your contributers say Steve Martin puts his own stamp on the character to that I would say balderdash his portrayals will be long forgotten when those of Silvers and Sellars will be treasured for generations to come
Director Jonathan Lynn has made some underrated comedies in the past like Greedy and Clue This isn t one of them More akin to a Police Academy film than its inspiration it stars Steve Martin in the old Phil Silvers role as an army sergeant forever pulling scams under the nose of his superiors But the idyllic life of Bilko and his lazy platoon looks shaky when an old enemy visits the base determined to catch Bilko in the act Nothing much happens really It s all quite dull It s not very funny Martin Dan Aykroyd and Phil Hartman squeeze a couple of laughs out through sheer effort but they re all better than this and it s quite painful watching them work with such thin material
I am sorry to fans of this film but it is the worst thing i have ever seen Slow badly cast and badly acted it is a film trying to escape the deadbeat romcoms of the recent years and failing McDonald and Parker seem unable to convey real emotion and are lifeless They seem to be in this one for any pay checks they are getting for it and not because they thought it was a good idea The plot is DULL i love great chick films as much as the next girl and this is not one If you avoid one film this year let it be
I absolutely hate this programme what kind of people sit and watch this garbage OK my dad and mum love it lol but i make sure I m well out of the room before it comes on Its so depressing and dreary but the worst thing about it is the acting i cant stand all detective programmes such as this because the detectives are so wooden and heartless What happened to detective programmes with real mystery I mean who wants to know what happened to fictional characters we know nothing about that died over 20 years ago I wish the bbc would put more comedy on bbc1 cos now with the vicar of dibley finished there is more room for crap like this
I feel like I ve just watched a snuff film a beautifully acted taut engrossing and horrible thing A two hour litany of perversion in the most basic and all inclusive sense of the word sexual violence and torture rape decapitation incest corruption live burial and abuse abuse abuse No redemption whatsoever And I WAS entertained I couldn t stop watching What does this say about me about the people who make and act in this sort of thing and a world that has become so desensitized that eventually real snuff films will be the norm And I m neither puritanical nor humorless I don t try to hide from the existence of darkness and I definitely have not led a sheltered life but I am ashamed of myself AND I m sorry to see my British cousins dragging the subject matter sewers the way my own tribe does It doesn t have to be cozy but does it have to wallow in vicarious sadism
No spoilers here but I have been a fan since Waking the Dead started but the last series of which only 3 have been on so far is awful The stories bear no resemblance to the original idea of the series I found these 3 in the last series jaw droppingly ludicrous As a BBC licence payer after the show I rang BBC complaints to pass on my disappointment I m amazed that actors of the calibre of Trevor Eve and Sue Johnstone didn t object to the story lines These actors have been with these characters for 8 seasons surly they can see it s lost all direction It s a good job it is the last series or the next series may start with the team investigating the death of Father Christmas br br Paul Bentley West Yorkshire England
Seeing as I hate reading long essays hoping to find a point and being disappointed I will first tell everyone that this movie was terrible Downright terrible And not surprisingly for the reasons mentioned in the first review I thought I might agree with him seeing as he gave the movie the rank it deserved but was sorrowfully rebuked upon reading what he said I am quite ashamed to be taking the same side as someone who commented that the movie definitely lacks good looking females Let me be the first to say Wow that was definitely some serious in depth reviewing there My mind can hardly comprehend the philosophical musings about this movie Seriously though a lack of good looking females shouldn t be considered an essential to a movie If you re desperate enough for good looking females you should really watch other types of movies not necessarily falling into the sci fi category
As seems to be the general gist of these comments the film has some stunning animation I watched it on blu ray but it really falls short of any real depth br br Firstly the characters are all pretty dull I got a hint of a kind of Laputa situation between Agito Toola and the main antagonist Shunack However maybe my mind wanderd and this was wishful thinking Laputa being my favourite animé original Engilsh dub The characters are not really lovable either and as mentioned in another post they fall in love exceptionally quickly leaving poor old Minka jealous and rejected she loves Agito who seems oblivious of this However she promptly seems to forgive Toola at the end with no explanation for the change of heart other than it makes the ending a little bit more happy br br There is also a serious lack of explanation Like who are the druids really Are they people and who are the weird women girls who seem to hang out with them and run the forest There is nothing explaining why they are there and how they can give regular humans superpowers The plants coming from the moon still does not fill in the blanks about this It is almost like a weird version of The Day of the Triffids br br And who does call Toola why bother with this if it wont be explained br br I really wanted to like this film but I found the plot no where near as deep as a film like Ghost in the Shell or having any real character like those of Miyazaki I do not resent watching it but I do sort of wish I hadn t bought it My advice Give it a go if you have a couple of hours to spare but borrow it or buy it cheap Perhaps if your new to animé films and don t have much to go by you will enjoy it It certainly is visually pleasing
As many agree Origin is a beautiful anime artistically The music graphics and the world created are gorgeous and it really stands above most other modern animated works However if you are looking for more than this than I suggest looking else where The beauty stops short of its appearance and when it really comes down to plot and characters there s nothing special Action is slow and minimal and the people are flat corny at times and do not act realistically Not to mention the plot hole here and the plot hole there So in summary oh my goodness I ve never seen an anime as beautiful as this one and oh my goodness it s like poke people don t act like that It took a GIANT step forward in graphics and music in anime but it also took a few step backs to times of bad characterization and unfortunately there s not even that much action to make up for that
This was a rip off of the same garbage we had to watch Bob Saget host during the half hour before this Dave Coulier only thought he was funny and it was pretty much the same show as America s Funniest Home Videos except with a hosts who have a combined IQ of three Tawny Kitaen must ve really needed the money and Coulier had to go to the recycle bin for his jokes It was torture enough having to see him imitate Popeye and other washed up cartoon starts on Full House That one dude who played all of the practical jokes on everyone deserves to be on the receiving end of a Grade A wedgie Coulier must ve needed to money to please Alannis Morisette while they were dating
I remember that show I still remember that kick ass fun song America s Funniest People Frankly it should ve been titled American s lame or unfunny or downright disgusting People Dave couldn t save this show and neither could Bob Saget or the replacement hosts for AFV that came later The Jackalope segments were hilarious and yes Dave could make some good voice overs that were better than Bob s But this show went to hell because of the lame crappy videos people submitted Also it developed as somewhat of a variety show with lame guest stars including the Olson Twins Plus AFV was in it s prime before they started picking the drooling ugly as sin babies as the winner Did I mentioned the videos were disgusting and lame But still the theme song rocks
A woman Sylvia Kristel seduces a 15 year old boy Eric Brown They have sex but it s all tied into some stupid plot or something br br Easily one of the most disturbing sex comedies ever Does anyone realize this movie is making light of child molestation I suppose it s OK cause it s a teenage boy if we had one with a man seducing a teenage girl there would rightfully be outrage Sorry but having it done to a boy doesn t excuse it It s still sick I realize Brown was of age he was actually 18 when this was made but he LOOKS 15 I just find it disturbing that some people find this OK br br Plot aside the acting sucks Kristel is beautiful but can t act Brown is easily one of the worst child actors I ve ever seen and the constant nudity gets boring and isn t even remotely erotic br br I saw this drivel at a theatre back in 1981 I was 19 and with my 14 year old cousin who could easily pass for 18 HE wanted to see it I didn t but I decideD what the heck We got in and I actually bought tickets for three teenage boys who were obviously underage My cousin thought is was boring and the three other kids left halfway through Let me make this clear three TEENAGE BOYS left a movie with tons of female nudity That should give you an idea of how bad this is I m surprised this was ever released A 1 all the way
A previous reviewer said the movie is not all that bad What The movie glorifies child molestation Oh but Sylvia Kristel was naked in it so let s give it 5 out of 10 stars Why not a full 10 Because the filmography was agonizing the child s looks of shock were unrealistic and the fat friend was irritating Nowhere in the review does the reviewer express any outrage that an American movie in 1981 featured scenes of a child having sex with a grown woman I happened to catch this steaming loaf of a movie while staying at a hotel that had Showtime To me even if the fat friend had acted up a storm and was a deserving of an Oscar I would still have to give the movie only 1 star That TV s Howard Hessman starred in the movie at the same time as he was appearing in WKRP is particularly ridiculous But don t take my word for it
It is obviously illegal Pedophiles pray on stuff like this How did they get away with making such a movie This movie is all summed up in one word SICK Where do people get off making and watching these kinds of films As I was watching the movie I didn t actually think they would allow this kid that is say maybe 12 if that actually sleep with this woman Sorry if this is a spoiler to you but I would have rater not seen this Where has the sanity of these people gone Maybe the makers of this movie are pedophiles Our society today is filled with all types of sexual predators that pray upon children yet film makers make these types of movies that do nothing but provoke this type of behavior I noticed that on a previous comment someone asked if there was a version where it showed them naked This is a kid here and someone is asking something like this What is wrong with this picture
Back in my days as an usher Private Lessons played at the 4 plex I was working It was a sleeper hit selling out Friday and Saturday nights for several weeks I never got around to seeing it but saw that it was on cable this last weekend so I decided to give it a shot What I witnessed for the next 90 minutes was one of the worst movies I have ever seen and one that made me terribly uncomfortable to watch br br The basic story is a teenage boy lusts after his sexy maid Sylvia Kristel She too seems to feel an attraction towards the boy but for more sinister reasons So we get scenes of the boy watching her undress and her inviting him in to watch And it goes from there br br Eric Brown as the teenage boy has to be one of the worst actors I have ever seen His scared reactions to every time Sylvia takes off a piece of clothing or when she touches him are horrible I didn t laugh a single time during this piece of junk br br And let s not get started on the subplot of the maid and chauffeur planning to extort money from the kid Let s just say it involves faking a death burying a body I could go on and on but it gets more ridiculous br br The sex scenes are the worst I have ever seen Even though Eric Brown was older then he looked the fact is he looks like a baby It appears he has no idea how to kiss a woman if THAT was acting then maybe I should re think my criticisms of Brown and it just came too close to bordering on child pornography to be erotic I have never been so turned off by a sex scene even though Miss Kristel is quite beautiful with and without clothes br br SPOILER WARNING I must make mention of the last scene To me it s just plain sick but I can remember audiences cheering as the film freeze framed and dissolved into credits Our hero returns to school and begins a flirtation with one of the female teachers He asks her out for dinner and she gives him a look as if Tom Cruise has just asked her out She nods affirmatively and he walks away smiling at the camera in triumph GIVE ME A BREAK Yes I am sure teachers all over would just risk everything for a plain looking teenage kid br br I will never understand the appeal this film had in 1982 Certainly it was more then the nudity because there were plenty of teen sex comedies with nudity that bombed at the box office And to think that these same teenagers that cheered that movie 22 years ago are now working their way up corporate ladders and possibly helping to run this country THAT is a scary thought
Let s put political correctness aside and just look at this in terms of the numerous sex comedies that came out in the 1980 s because I for one don t think this is any better or any worse than the others Unless your some religious kook or an uptight female you can probably view a silly film such as this without getting all worked up about the content and I personally had a totally innocuous feeling towards this before and after watching it Story is set in Albuquerque New Mexico where a rich 15 year old boy named Phillip Philly Fillmore Eric Brown is naturally horny as hell and starts spying on the attractive maid that has just started working for his father br br SPOILER ALERT Nicole Mallow Sylvia Kristel is friendly to Philly but things heat up when his father goes out of town on business and she starts to flirt with him to the point where she invites him into her bedroom to watch her undress Philly is awkward and doesn t know how to react at first but soon he goes for it and has sex but than to his horror it seems that Nicole has died from a heart attack With the help from the sleazy chauffeur Lester Lewis Howard Hesseman they seemingly have buried her body but a note from a blackmailer shows up and Philly must get 10 000 out of his father s safe Philly is shocked when Nicole shows up and he learns that the whole thing was an extortion plan set up by Lester and that she only went along with it because she s an illegal alien and if she didn t do what she was told Lester would have called the immigration office Together they try to get his father s money back before he returns home and they enlist the help from Jack Ed Begley Jr who is a tennis instructor but pretends to be a cop to scare Lester br br This little comedy was made for less than 3 million but it grossed over 50 million worldwide and made it one of the least likely films during that time to be so successful which prompts me to wonder why this was a hit and not any of the others in the genre Director Alan Myerson can boast that he made a hit film but the truth is that he never really had a career in films although he did go on to be very successful in television So why did this become so successful I have a thought that it just may be because of Kristel and before you decide that I m crazy listen to my reasoning Kristel was an international star because of her soft core films so that reason alone made many free thinking adults curious about viewing her in an American film that was getting a wide release With that the same adults would also be nostalgic about their own youth and the fantasy of being taught the ways of lovemaking by an attractive older woman which brings in the much younger audience members who are probably still very inexperienced and curious about the film Anyway that s my thought and if anyone has another reason I would love to hear it but back to the film itself it s apparent and very sad that a film like this could probably never get made again except in Europe because of the religious right and the other prudish freaks who just can t come to terms with the fact that a teenage boy getting laid will not do him any harm In fact it s a valuable service that ALL BOYS pray will happen to them The film itself is clumsy and Kristel s body double is all too evident in certain scenes especially if you take careful note of the difference in their nipples The story although intriguing in it s basic form is neither very funny or revealing so were left ogling the nude scenes that are really the norm for the genre
One of the those coming of age films that should have nostalgia for adults and promise for the kids This movie has neither It is a poor excuse to let Sylvia Kristel s body double frolic with a dorky Eric Brown To make matters worse the movie is either silly or stupid when it tries to be funny sexy or dramatic Laugh awkwardly as we are supposed to believe that a teenager would go alone with burying a dead woman in his front yard Ponder vigorously on why a woman famous for Emmanuelle needs a body double As the movie went on and on I started to imagine a hybrid of Private Lessons and Little Miss Millions that had Sylvia Kristel seduce Jennifer Love Hewitt as Howard Hesseman makes us nostalgic for WKRP Watch this to laugh at other people s stupidity or for Ed Begley Jr s committed performance or to wonder what Sylvia Kristel would look like with Jennifer Love Hewitt But I can give you an idea of your lesson stay away from movies staring Sylvia Kristel that are not Emmanuelle
The film looks super on paper A romantic comedy in which a frantic lover gets dragged into a smuggling thriller should be generic cross breeding gold especially with this excellent romcomic cast br br I m afraid Lawrence Kasdan simply gives his two stars too much rope though and they duly go and hang themselves Adam Brooks script may well be to blame but you d expect better from the Kevin Kline of A Fish Called Wanda Instead the two ping pong off one another and the unlikely burgeoning romance is never reconciled satisfactorily with the reason either of them are in and dashing around France br br Jean Reno co stars amiably as the cop with a heart and I guess wishes he was a star with a part Mind you he went on to do those Pink Panther remake s so perhaps he was OK with this 3 10
Un bleeping believable Meg Ryan doesn t even look her usual pert lovable self in this which normally makes me forgive her shallow ticky acting schtick Hard to believe she was the producer on this dog Plus Kevin Kline what kind of suicide trip has his career been on Whoosh Banzai Finally this was directed by the guy who did Big Chill Must be a replay of Jonestown hollywood style Wooofff
The premise is ridiculous the characters unbelievable the dialogue trite and the ending absurd br br Believe me I m a fan of Kevin Kline but watching him do a Pepe Le Pew accent for 2 hours as a supposed Frenchman is not nearly as amusing as it sounds br br For her part Meg Ryan is once again as perky and adorable as a take your pick kewpie doll baby puppy kitten whatever you happen to think is the cutest creature on earth She also bears not the slightest resemblance to a real human being br br This movie strikes me as an opportunity seized by buddies Lawrence Kasdan and Kline to vacation in Paris and the south of France while being well paid for it So I can t really blame them
Kevin Kline and Meg Ryan are among that class of actors which I am always interested in seeing despite reviews I have always found Ms Ryan to be a charming and winsome actress in nearly all her roles and Kevin Kline is almost always worth watching br br I say nearly and almost in large part because of this movie br br First off Meg Ryan does not play a likeable character she plays a weak willed whiner who begins grating on your nerves shortly after the opening credits and doesn t give up until several days later That said Kevin Kline s character is even more annoying and less likeable So even if you normally like these two actors I recommend your give this movie a pass
I give this five out of 10 All five marks are for Hendrix who delivers a very decent set of his latter day material Unfortunately the quality of the camera work and editing is verging on the appalling We have countless full face shots of Hendrix where he could almost be doing anything taking a pee perhaps We don t see his hands on the guitar thats the point Also we re given plenty shots of Hendrix from behind There appears to be three cameras on Hendrix but amateur fools operate all of them The guy in front of Hendrix seems to be keen to wander his focus lazily about the stage as if Hendrix on the guitar is a mere distraction While the guy behind is keener on zeroing in on a few chicks in the stalls than actually documenting the incredible guitar work thats bleeding out the amps the sound recording is good thanks to Wally Heider Interspersed on the tracks are clips of student losers protesting against Vietnam etc on tracks like Machine Gun complete waste of film If Hendrix had lived even another two years Berkeley is one of those things that would never have seen the light of day as far as a complete official release goes The one gem it does contain is the incredible Johnny B Good but all in a pretty poor visual document of the great man and inferior to both Woodstock and Isle of Wight
Were I not with friends and so cheap I would have walked out It failed miserably as satire and didn t even have the redemption of camp
I saw this movie originally in the theater when I was 10 Even at that age the humor was mildly insulting to my adolescent intelligence br br In the past whenever I would see Ed Begley Jr or jeff Goldblum I would cringe and start to feel very uncomfortable and even slightly sad Until I was reminded of the existence of this movie today I was unsure why I felt that way Apparently I blocked my memory of this movie yet my negative feelings towards two of the perpetrators remained Apparently I forgot that I saw this movie but subconsciously mourned the pieces of my soul that had been stolen nay EATEN by the creators of this inhuman work br br I haven t been brave enough to try watching it as an adult I imagine that as part of the healing process that I should probably look at confronting this childhood fear so that I can truly put it behind me Some regression therapy and or hypnosis might not be a bad idea either
This comedy has some tolerably funny stuff in it surrounded by a lot of unfunny stuff Just about every scene involving the servants of the castle and their silly antics is a waste of time And the plotting is so sloppy that it makes you wonder if they actually had a script ready before they started filming this or they were simply making it all up as they went along 1 2
Transylvania 6 5000 is an insignificant but occasionally funny and charming mid 80 s horror parody with some very familiar names in the cast and a handful of genuine opportunities to chuckle in the script Two bozo journalist of a gossipy tabloid newspaper are sent very much against their will to Transylvania to do a story on the alleged return of mad scientist Frankenstein There are some adorable little gimmicks and details to discover left and right in the film like a little guillotine for hard boiled eggs and laboratory test tubes that are being used to put in cream and sugar at the breakfast table The wholesome of the film however is not as successful as it could and should have been with jokes and parody situations that are way too overlong The Roger Corman production Transylvania Twist which came out four years after this is a lot funnier and much more recommended The film is particularly parodying the classic Universal milestones of the early 30 s so you better make sure you ve seen those if you want to grasp all the tiny gags and references There s a pretty original twist indicating that the Frankenstein character only behaves like a mad raving evil scientist when he enters his laboratory It s also revealed that he s actually more of a Father Damien sort of messiah who s only concerned with the condition of exiled monsters Michael Richards the freaky guy who plays Kramer in Seinfeld stars as a psychotic butler who appears and disappears at the most inappropriate moments I m pretty sure John Turturro s character in Mr Deeds was inspired by Richards s role here
Horror spoofs are not just a thing of the 21st century Way before the Scary Movie series there were a few examples of this genre mostly in the 80s But like said franchise most of these films are hit or miss Some like Elvira Mistress of the Dark mostly rise above that but other like Saturday the 14th and it s sequel fail to deliver the laughs But out of all these types of films there is one particularly big offender and that s Transylvania 6 5000 a major waste of time for many reasons br br Pros A great cast that does it s best Some of the dopey humor is amusing A corny but catch theme song Some good Transylvanian locations br br Cons Threadbare plot Mostly tedious pacing Most of the humor just doesn t cut it The monsters are given little to do and little screen time I thought this was supposed to be a spoof of monster movies Lame ending that will likely make viewers angry br br Final thoughts This is a comedy If it is then why are the really funny bits so few and far in between Comedies are supposed to make us roll on the floor not roll our eyes and yawn aching for it to be over I can t believe Anchor Bay released this tired junk I ll admit it s not one of the worst films ever made but it s not worth anyone s time or money even if you re a fan of any of the actors See Transylvania Twist instead br br My rating 2 5
Anyone familiar with my reviews on the Internet Movie Database will know that I can be a grumpy bastard from time to time There are a lot of films I don t like which for some unfathomable reason I ve felt the urge to review However if anyone out there is curious to know the name of the worst film I ve ever seen look no further than Transylvania 6 5000 Without question this takes the title of the all time no 1 awful film I can t believe that I actually made it from the start of this clunker to the finish br br It is clearly meant to capture the flavour of Mel Brooks s Young Frankenstein but where that film was a funny take on horror movie traditions this one is a desperately strained and misguided attempt to wring laughs from embarrassingly weak material Jeff Goldblum and Ed Begley Jr look ashamed to be here as a pair of journalists in modern day Transylvania perhaps they realised early on that they were doomed in this dud During their research they come up against all the chief monsters from past horror favourites such as vampires werewolves and mummies br br Anyone who manages to brave this film right through to its end may pray that a stake be driven through their heart to relieve them from the agony of boredom It marks a career nadir for everyone involved and proves that when comedy fails in a big way it results in awesomely dire entertainment
Oh brother The only reason this very irritating film avoids getting the total bomb from me is because it s at least historically noteworthy as the first Three Stooges film when they weren t yet on their own and were still saddled with that painfully unfunny Ted Healy But even as a longtime Stooges fan I d have to say that young Moe Larry and Curly are badly used here as three zany assistant janitors to Mr Healy s taller boss janitor They re not featured steadily through the movie and their silly on and off again stints paint them more like zany overactive cartoon characters trying too hard to be amusing br br Most of this toothache deals with Jack Pearl seeking in vain to get some chuckles from the audience himself as a man who impersonates Baron Munchausen here s a good example of the level of humor I object On what grounds Coffee grounds His sidekick is none other than a young Jimmy Durante but even the schnoz himself is a bore
Strained comedy a sketch like revue which was initially a vehicle to showcase one time radio star Jack Pearl but is now best remembered as America s introduction to The Three Stooges Actually Larry Curly and Moe are billed alongside comic Ted Healy as Ted Healy and his Three Stooges Although the supporting cast features Jimmy Durante who is completely wasted on dim material and ZaSu Pitts the only audience for the film these days are Stooges addicts and even they won t find much to applaud here Incredibly loud and overbearing it shows how far Hollywood had to go to reach a certain level of slapstick sophistication 1 2 from
This movie starred a totally forgotten star from the 1930s Jack Pearl radio s Baron Munchausen as well as Jimmy Durante However 7 1 2 decades later it s being billed as a Three Stooges film because they are the only ones in the film who the average person would recognize today Film fanatics will also recognize the wonderful Edna May Oliver as well as Zazu Pitts br br As for the Stooges this is a film from there very early days before MGM had any idea what to do with the team At this point they were known as Ted Healy and his Stooges as Healy was the front man Fortunately for the Stooges they soon left this nasty and rather untalented man read up on him you ll see what I mean and the rest is history Within a year they were making very successful shorts for Columbia and executives at MGM were soon kicking themselves for losing the team This sort of thing was a common occurrence at MGM a great studio which had no idea what to do with comedy such as the films of Buster Keaton Laurel and Hardy Abbott and Costello and others In fact up until they left for Columbia MGM put them in a wide variety of odd film roles including acting with Clark Gable and Joan Crawford in DANCING LADY And oddly in this film they didn t act as a team they just did various supporting roles such as Larry playing the piano br br This particular film begins with Pearl and Durante lost in the African jungle When they are rescued and brought home all sense of structure to the film falls apart and the film becomes almost like a variety show punctuated by scenes with the leads here and there As for Pearl I could really see why he never made a successful transition to films as he has the personality of a slug but slightly less welcome As for Durante I never knew what the public saw in him as least as far as his films are concerned he was loud and loud He apparently took time off from helping MGM to ruin Buster Keaton s career to make this film Together Pearl and Durante rely on lots of verbal humor and Vaudeville style routines that tend to fall rather flat br br In this film the Stooges they didn t yet have the right chemistry Seeing Healy doing the job that Moe did in their later films is odd What they did in the film was pretty good but because all the segments were short they came on and off camera too quickly to allow them to really get into their routines Stooges fans might be very frustrated at this though die hard fans may want to see this so that they can complete their life long goal of seeing everything Stooge even the rotten Joe DeRita and Joe Besser films oh and did they got bad after the deaths of Shemp and Curly br br Overall the film is rather dull and disappointing However there are a couple interesting things to look for in the mess At about the 13 minute mark you will see a brief scene where a tour guide on a bus is singing Look carefully as this is Walter Brennan in a role you d certainly never expect Another unusual thing to look for in the film is the Clean as a Whistle song starting at about 22 minutes into the film This song and dance number is clearly an example of a so called Pre Code scene that never would have been allowed in films after 1934 when the Production Code was strengthened Despite the word Clean in the title it s a very titillating number with naked women showing lots of flesh enough to stimulate but not enough to really show anything It s quite shocking when seen today though such excesses were pretty common in the early 1930s Finally at the 63 minute mark see Jimmy Durante set race relations back a few decades See the film you ll see that I mean
This film s basic premise is a political cartoon I suppose for those who know nothing about the realities of the military this is probably a feel good film on gender equality Indeed a recent commentator stated it lets women know that they can do anything they want to do What claptrap No one man or woman can do anything they want to do and unfortunately Demi Moore buffing up for SEAL Hell Week in the early 27 week BUD S program by a few sessions at the local gym and her desire alone to be a SEAL is simply not going to make it so There is approximately an 80 dropout rate in what is arguably THE roughest military training program those are the ones who voluntarily drop out can t compete on a physical level suffer frequent physical injury during the training or can t handle the psychological harassment I never got beyond the shallowness of the contrived purported message of this film In the real world Demi wouldn t last the first 24 hours in this harsh and sustained physical training Wishing alone won t do it Skip this film as wishful thinking and better spend your time reading The Warrior Elite by Dick Couch Crown New York 2001 for the best description as to what really goes on in this training Ring the bell Demi br br
This is easily the worst Ridley Scott film Ridley Scott is a wonderful director But this film is a black mark on his career Demi Moore and Viggo Mortensen both totally miscast in an overaggressive film about a girl going to the army Very stupid And there is never one scene that is convincing in any way It is really not difficult to make a film such as this Everything the crew makes could have been an idea of just anybody The writers didn t have much inspiration either many foolish dialogs that made no sense at all and some brainless action I strongly recommend to stay away from this rubbish I hope that the many talented persons involved in this project realize this type of film does not deserve their attention and that in the future they will work on more honorable and more intelligent movies than this useless mess
This movie is very much like Flashdance you know that dance flick with Jennifer Beals That film is probably the most boring film I have ever seen since it s not even bad enough to be funny G I Jane is much better than that film but that doesn t say much Here Demi Moore sweats a lot and there s high music and we get to see her fight and everything but it is certainly not very engaging I really think the idea behind the film is kind of interesting but the script is too clichéd and Ridley Scott can t do anything about that Well like I said It s better than Flashdance 4 10
A real disappointment from the great visual master Ridley Scott G I Jane tells the story of a first female ever to go through the hellish training at the Navy SEALs The training is the most difficult and hard in existence as the instructor says in the film to the lead character O Neil played by Demi Moore There is no particular message or point in this film or then I couldn t reach it properly It may be a some kind of a statement of female rights and abilities but it all sinks under the tired scenes and stupid gun fight at the end of the film br br I really can t understand why Ridley uses so much zooms in that mentioned last gun battle at the desert It looks sooooo stupid and irritating and almost amateurish so I would really like to know what the director saw in that technique When I look at his latest film Black Hawk Dawn there is absolutely nothing wrong in the battle scenes which are plenty and they are very intense and directed with skill The whole finale in G I Jane looks ugly and is nothing more but stupid and brainless shooting and killing br br This is Ridley Scott s worst movie in my opinion and there are no significant touches from which this great director is known Still I m glad I saw this in Widescreen format because there are still couple of great scenes and samples of Scott s abilities but they are very few in this film br br A disappointment and nothing compared to the classics Blade Runner Thelma Louise Alien and so on of this talented director So I m forced to give G I Jane 4 10
Hmmm where to start How does a serious actress like Demi Moore got involved in such crap First blood might be rated as bull t but this type of nonsense is just Rambo with tits point Of course if you are interested in the crapstory Demi Moore just wants to prove that a woman can be part of the NAVY Seals that is the most stupid cliché one I can think of you ll say GI Jane is a great movie Just the performance from Viggo Mortensen made this movie bearable but hell I can t think of Demi Moore being Rambo especially not during the last useless 30 minutes Ridley Scott doesn t deserve the credits to make this movie one that comes up for women with equal rights it s just brainless propaganda for the American army and to make it more attractive they dropped Moore in it Awful movie
A recent post here by a woman claiming a military background contained the comment A woman s life is no more valuable than a man s br br This mantra of the politically correct is not true as history as well as biology show Societies have managed to recover from heavy losses of their male population sometimes with astonishing speed Germany was ready to fight another war in 1939 despite the 1914 1918 war in which over two million of her men were killed In South America s War of the Triple Alliance 1865 Paraguay took on three neighboring countries until virtually her entire male population was wiped out but fought to a stalemate in the 1932 Chaco War against much larger Bolivia br br No society however has or ever could survive the loss of its female population Only when the very life of the nation is at stake are women sent to fight Israel faced that situation in 1948 but since then has never considered coed combat units for its Defense Forces despite the popular image of the Israeli girl soldier br br G I Jane is Hollywood fluff
br br How this film ever got a 6 star average is beyond me The script is so banal and frankly an insult to whomevers life it is based upon The cinematography comes straight from the slick world of advertising and the talented Ridley Scott should be ashamed Demi Moore however shows none a surprise by participating in this film if one looks at her tracklist All in all a high concept style film that even Don Simpson would be ashamed of
I think that movie can t be a Scott s film That is impossible Do you remember Blade Runner And Alien Two greats movies versus a one I hope didn t see ever it good bye
Naturally I didn t watch GI Jane out of choice I was more or less forced to watch this film round my ex girlfriends house br br GI Jane loses its credibility straight away by trying to convince the viewer that it is potentially a real scenario which of course it isn t The result of this is that the story becomes automatically bound by constraints restricting the amount of humour of which there is none or entertaining action scenes and soon becomes too serious The film therefore becomes extremely boring and predictable br br GI Jane fails where other action films succeed mainly because films such as James Bond Dirty Harry and various others are larger than life yet never proclaim to be otherwise They are escapism and therefore entertaining GI Jane tries to be real and fails br br This is a very disappointing film from Ridley Scott with a very non credible storyline unremarkable acting and the only reason I give it 2 10 instead of 1 10 is for some of the technical work
After reading through many of the reviews I don t know what movie some people were watching but clearly it wasn t the same one I saw br br This movie is horrible The acting primarily Moore s is just terrible The woman cannot act Nice tits but she just can t act At no point did she come across as the actual character Instead it was spoiled Hollywood actress goes to the beach to play make believe with the boys br br And that s what this movie ultimately is Hollywood make believe The training sequences are over the top The politics over the top The political correctness over the top The combat scenes you guessed it over the top Your mission is to get in and get out without being detected So what do you do Why shoot off as many rounds and make as much noise as possible of course Oh G I Jane you can be my wing man anytime br br The premise is good but as soon as Hollywood gets a hold of it we end up with Top Gun with tits br br What more is to be expected from commercial US films anymore Not much I guess
Watching this movie was a waste of time I was tempted to leave in the middle of the movie but I resisted I don t know what Ridley Scott intended but I learned that in the army women get as stupid as men They learn to spit to insult and to fight in combat and that s also a waste of time in my opinion And anyway what the hell was that final scene in Lybia Are they still fighting Gadafi or is it that it s easy for everyone to believe islamic people are always a danger
I ll be short and to the point This movie was an insult to any one with a room temperature IQ Sorry liberals feminists etc No women will ever be a Seal They can forget about the draft or being in combat too Ain t going to happen You see hard as it is to understand or accept men and women are physically different Regardless of the fact it is 2007 reality cannot change things in order for people to avoid having their feelings hurt Men can t give birth or breast feed babies Oh I forgot about San Franfreako br br Women lack the physical strength to be on par with men in a combat or other physically challenging situations How many women play in the NFL or NHL Lastly I couldn t give a bloody hoot in hell if what I just wrote upsets you Come to think of it if this does upset you that only warms my heart more I didn t write one thing that wasn t the truth This imbecilic movie is nothing more than a comedy and a lousy one at that
Demi Moore s character in the movie was selected for the SEALs because of her looks That was a bad start and the movie went down from there The plot was totally unbelievable The will to make it in a tough military unit is not enough This movie did not convince me of a woman s physical ability to perform the types of tasks required br br Trying to pretend that women and men are basically the same is an insult to everyone s intelligence The differences between the sexes are what makes life interesting
I thought this was a truly awful film I found myself actually yelling at my tv a couple times One or both of the gay male leads was miscast there was absolutely no chemistry between them and Richard Ruccolo looked like he d rather be kissing a dog The movie covers their long and tortured courtship highlighting each break up and make up but not developing the reasons in between in any detail These reasons would make for some interesting characters not the fight or the make up scene in bed lame even if you liked the movie br br Andrea Martin and Adam Goldberg shine as their characters but it doesn t make the film worth renting Save your money
Why would a person go back to a person who kicks them in the teeth not once not twice but over and over again br br This film teaches us that in order to find love we must accept abuse not just forgive it but fully accept it Gosh No wonder my first relationship only lasted ten years I obviously wasn t embracing my inner masochist br br As Bucatinsky s writing debut there are many wonderful aspects to this film however in order to justify the reunion of Eli and Tom more character development would have been helpful We are never acquainted with Eli s masochism in fact we are led to believe that he is not a masochist although Tom s psycho emotional sadism is highly evident
I saw this recent Woody Allen film because I m a fan of his work and I make it a point to try to see everything he does though the reviews of this film led me to expect a disappointing effort They were right This is a confused movie that can t decide whether it wants to be a comedy a romantic fantasy or a drama about female mid life crisis It fails at all three br br Alice Mia Farrow is a restless middle aged woman who has married into great wealth and leads a life of aimless luxury with her rather boring husband and their two small children This rather mundane plot concept is livened up with such implausibilities as an old Chinese folk healer who makes her invisible with some magic herbs and the ghost of a former lover with whom she flies over Manhattan If these additions sound too fantastic for you how about something more prosaic like an affair with a saxophone player br br I was never quite sure of what this mixed up muddle was trying to say There are only a handful of truly funny moments in the film and the endingis a really preposterous touch of Pollyanna br br Rent Crimes and Misdemeanors instead a superbly well done film that suceeds in combining comedy with a serious consideration of ethics and morals Or go back to Annie Hall or Manhattan
I saw this movie in NEW York city I was waiting for a bus the next morning so it was 2 or 3 in the morning It was raining and did not want to wait at the PORT AUTHORTY So I went across the street and saw the worst film of my life It was so bad that I chose to stay and see the whole movie I have yet to see anything else that bad since The year was 69 so call me crazy I stayed only because I could not belive it
This is one of those movies that apparently was trying to ride the martial arts wave craze Kind of like Billy Jack I guess However whereas Billy Jack did have one notable martial arts scene there are none in this one unless you consider some gentlemanly grappling and roughhousing as such We are introduced to the star who is described as having learned Judo in the marines I was in the marines and while they are pretty established in boxing I really don t remember any emphasis on Judo As a result the antagonist James Macarthur makes reference to the Judo when he offers an excuse for why he a state champion wrestler was so easily defeated Lame
God I am so sick of the crap that comes out of America called Cartoons br br Since anime became popular the USA animators either produce a cartoon with a 5 year old lazy ass style of drawing Kappa Mikey or some cheep Japanese animation rip off Usually messing up classic characters No wonder anime is beating American cartoons br br They are not even trying anymore br br Oh I just heard of this last night I live in the UK and when I found out this show first came out in 2005 well I never knew the UK was so up to date with current shows
I think this piece of garbage is the best proof that good ideas can be destroyed why all the American animators thinks that the kids this days wants stupid GI JOE versions of good stories the Looney Tunes are some of the most beloved characters in history but they weren t created to be Xtreme i mean come on Tiny Toons was a great example of how an old idea can be updated without loosing it s original charm but this piece of garbage is just an example of stupid corporate decisions that only wants to create a cheap idiotic show that kids will love because hey kids loves superheroes right the whole show is only a waste of time in which we see the new versions of the Looney Tunes but this time in superhero form this doesn t sound too bad but the problem is that this show tries too hard to copy series like batman the animated series or the new justice league the result bad copies of flash the road runner or superman who else bugs bunny the problem is that Looney Tunes weren t meant to be dramatic the were supposed to be funny as i said before this series sucks and many people wonders why anime is taking all over the world this show tries to be dramatic and action packed but that s something that few series and anime are able to do if you want to see a good upgrade of an old show watch Tiny Toons that s an example that it s possible to bring back to life old characters but with a good story and respecting the original roots too bad that show is already dead another corporate wise decision i suppose
Loonatics Unleashed is the worst thing that could happen to the classic characters created by Chuck Jones The Loony Tunes have many spin offs and different versions some were good others not very much But Loonatics it s the worst The concept is stupid and derivative of shows as The Power Rangers and Teen Titans There wasn t any similarity with the original characters and the stories are boring and poorly made The new designs are ugly and the animation is pathetic This show just doesn t work This horrible waste of animation is a complete failure and this shouldn t have be nothing more than a bad joke Lame Zero stars
Loony Tunes have ventured at least twice into the future The first time was with the brilliantly funny Duck Dodgers The latter time was with this um effort Loonatics Unleashed isn t without merit and might be considered a good product were it not that it isn t up to Warner Brothers quality WB cartoons are noted for their cheeky humor appealing at least as much to adults as to children These pedestrian superhero episodes on the other hand cannot fail to convince adults to pass them up br br The premise of the series is that 6 ordinary individuals 2 bunnies a Tasmanian devil a duck a roadrunner and a coyote live on the city planet of Acmetropolis and acquire super powers when a meteor strikes the planet in 2772 What s confusing is that the titles section features these individuals with a count up to 2772 from the 21st Century Cute but frelling stupid br br In each episode the super sextet amid mildly amusing but essentially banal banter fight various super villains For the most part these are types that appear in every mediocre superhero adventure series and even some of the better ones Like many mediocre superhero series this one takes its villains far too seriously for the context And of course these guys are the only characters that laugh the usual evil laugh of course Why is it that villains in predictable superhero adventures always ALWAYS laugh evilly at every opportunity Animated material of this sort seems to leave laughter exclusively in the province of villains and occasionally their henchpeople and or henchthings br br In point of fact the makers of this series missed their best bets right from the get go The superpowers of the characters are sometimes based on their previous normal abilities but sometimes not The problem here is that we don t see enough WB looniness Lexi and Ace have fairly ordinary biologically generated energy weapons and have virtually no personality traits one could describe as Bugs like What we have here is basically the silly and drekish Teen Titans including its overly modern animation look but with animals Feh br br The other misstep by the program s creators is or are the villains As noted before these are not terribly imaginative and do the evil laugh bit excessively Amazingly the writers totally missed the obvious technique of making villains from stock WB characters as well as the protagonists Adding to the fun could have been say Jupiter Sam as well as The Fudd still hunting wabbits as well as Tech E Coyote converted into a really neurotic villain and so on Ah the sadness of missed opportunities br br Sadly this whole production has gone into too much overtime that is a 2nd season Nevertheless we can rejoice that there s something new out there for the 14 going on 9 crowd The rest of us can hope for a 3rd season of Duck Dodgers
Well Chuck Jones is dead lets soil his characters by adding cheap explosions an American drawn anime knock off style and give them superpowers but sir don t we all ready have several shows in the works that are already like this much less don t dump all over their original creators dreams yes and those shows make us a bunch of cash and we need more but won t every man women and child who grew up with these time less characters be annoyed hay you re right set it in the future make them all descendent s of the original characters and change all the names slightly but not too much though we still need to be able to milk the success of the classics br br Well that s the only reason I can think of why this even exists If you look past the horrible desecration of our beloved Looney Toons then it looks like an OK show But then there is already the teen titan s which is the same bloody thing All the characters are dressed like batman they drive around in some sort of ship fighting super villains they have superpowers only difference is they sort of talk like the Looney tunes and have similar names and character traits br br This kind of thing falls into the it s so ridiculous it s good kind of category Think of the Super Mario brother s movie and Batman and Robin If you want to laugh for all the wrong reasons check this out If you are of the younger generation what this thing is actually intended for and can look pass the greedy executives shamelessness then run with it and enjoy br br If you enjoy this cartoon I don t have a problem with you it s the people who calculated this thing together that I am mad at You know how they say piracy is like stealing a car this show is like grave robbing They might as well of dug up all the people involved with the original cartoon shoved them on a display dressed them up in err pirate costumes and charged money If this show wasn t using characters ones that didn t resemble the Looney Toons in anyway whatsoever that have already made the studios millions then this would be fine But no For shame Warner brothers for shame br br If I saw this thing as a 30 second gag on an episode of the Simpson s or Family Guy I would love it As it is I just can t believe this was ever made I would bet anyone that 80 of the people who work on this show hate it But whatever it doesn t really matter in 10 years this show will have been forgotten while the originals will live on forever or at least until the world ends br br Coming 2008 Snoopy and the peanut gang are back and now they have freaking lasers and can turn invisible Can Charley Brown defeat the evil alien warlord Zapar Tune in and see
There will be a time where kids will have grown up without ever seeing the one and only Bugs Bunny kiss technically another man on the lips There will be a time where it won t be Duck or Rabbit season There will be a time where the Tazmanian Devil will be dubbed politically incorrect br br But so help me now is not that time br br Nobody really wants an EXTREME version of our beloved Loony characters Whoever it is in marketing who comes up with Corn Nuts Corn gone wrong and Extreme Doritos and evidently this festering turd should know that just because they have a degree in business or advertising or whatever doesn t mean they know jack about kids br br I think that they re doing a disservice to children depriving them of one of the greatest and most iconic shows of all time This show disgusts me and it s not just the dated artwork or terrible dialogue They misuse good voice talent like Phil Lamarr Michael Clarke Duncan Candi Milo and so many others It lacks style humor character development and most importantly heart br br The show like it s repackaged characters Slam Tasmanian Rev Runner Ace Bunny is but a shadow of it s former timeless and beautiful self
They probably should have called this movie The Map because the majority of the whole stupid film is revolved around a map of a cemetery Not to mention how many of the same boring shots of the map there are The only thing they show more than the map itself is the little beads of sweat that is constantly building up on the forehead of our main character This of course was the film makers way of showing us how incredibly tense things are getting up on the Immortal Hills Cemetery Come on now couldn t they have shown us just one of the death scenes We hear a whole lot about how everyone who is listed on the map is dropping like flies but we don t get to see anything Some how I Bury The Living manged to keep my attention so i was fairly generous with the rating i gave it but i will not recommend this movie to anyone Unless you have a deep fascination with maps or sweat i recommend renting a better I movie such as I Spit On Your Grave or I Drink Your Blood
This movie could have been great cause its got a somewhat fascinating premise but it never rises above sheer caricature The acting is severely flawed and there were moments where i cringed so severely that i thought i was going to fall of my seat in the theater Never and I mean never Watch this godawfull piece of Danish cinema has been getting a lot of good pr the recent years but if this piece of crosses the border I m afraid nobody sane will ever want to rent a danish movie This movie is the reason why i chose to register here I really felt i needed to steer people away from this piece of my sympathies go out to the people who already went to the cinema to watch this
I had high expectations of this movie the title translated is How We Get Rid of the Others After all the concept is great a near future in which the ruling elite has taken the consequence of the right wing government s constant verbal and legislative persecution of so called freeloaders and the left wing in general and decided to just kill off everyone who cannot prove that they re contributing something to the establishment the establishment being called the common good but actually meaning the interests of the ruling capitalist ideology br br Very cool idea Ideal for biting satire Only this movie completely blows its chance The satire comes out only in a few scenes and performances of absurdity but this satire is not sustained it is neither sharp nor witty And for an alleged comedy the movie has nearly no funny scenes The comedy I assume is supposed to be in the absurdity of the situations but the situations are largely uncomfortable and over serious rather than evoking either laughter or thought br br The script is rife with grave errors in disposition The action should have focused on the political aspects and how wrong it would be to do such a thing but instead oodles of time are spent on a young woman who was the one that wrote the new laws for fun and who s trying to save everybody by organizing a resistance that ships people to Africa All this is beside the point A movie like this should not pretend to be so serious It s a satire A political statement But it doesn t even begin to actually address the problem it s supposed to be about Maybe it was afraid of going too far How cowardly That s not art It s not even real satire br br Søren Pilmark a very serious and by now one of Denmark s absolutely senior actors was very good He largely carried what little entertainment value the movie had Everybody else nothing special well perhaps except for Lene Poulsen who did supply a convincing performance br br In fact a problem with most Danish movies is that the language never sounds natural Neither the formulation nor the delivery Why is it so difficult to make it sound right Why must it be so stilted and artificial I hope when people look at these movies fifty years from now they don t think that this was how people talked in general Danish society br br 3 out of 10
The script is so so laughable this in turn makes the actors lines sound stiff and unrealistic and not to be believed There s repetition of phrases my sweet little god daughter and minor variations of that line which comes to mind and it s just sloppy soap opera dialog br br Worse yet the music is so WRONG Plus the main bluesy theme is horribly quaint and entirely wrong for this And it feels overused mostly because the instrumentation texture and arrangement of this theme never changes even when the scene s emotional context does br br Subsequently whenever it appears it sticks out like a sore thumb as the main transition from one scene to another br br The music s corny and it s as if the writer were writing music for a soap or a sitcom a low budget 80 s Canadian sitcom at that and this makes it feel as if we re always on the brink of throwing to a commercial br br This is so miscast there s a lot of overacting and it s a real stretch that so many of these characters are employing only ONE type of NY accent a thick Bronx accent I don t know if it s a question of the actors limited capacity in only knowing one NY accent or whether it s a question of the director s ability to notice such an glaring anomaly br br In the end it s the amateur script with it s leaden lines which makes this entire movie blow When any foundation is shaky and unstable it s impossible to build upon it without it s flaws revealing themselves in exponentially more damaging and unflattering ways
I don t remember seeing another murder mystery movie as bad as this This movie about a medical examiner who investigates his friend s mysterious death in a car accident has the complete receipt for a bad movie bad acting boring story lack of suspense poor humor and no drama I remembered seeing this movie on PAX a TV station notable for dishing out low budgeted and campy made for TV movies such as this one TV movies of course do not have the edge factor or the suspense as movies from the Big Screen But this movie sure hit all sour tastes The makers of this movie have missed out on an opportunity to making Receipe for Murder a great TV movie the title does offer some suspense br br So if you want a good recipe don t watch this movie This movie alone can kill your TV appetite br br Grade F
The good thing about this that s at least fresh Almost no movies about dance music and the club scene if even made hit the cinemas And it radiates lots of energy too from the music to the portrayal of Ibiza br br But the main problem is that it can t decide what it wants to be Although it definitely likes to be a mockumentary in the line of This is Spinal Tap the makers also realized they wouldn t want to play copycat However it fails grossly on the jokes because it s not very well written and most characters are underdeveloped And it has no arc in its script and directing to make it to 90 minutes so why not edit it down to 75 The production department and cinematography still try to save the day e g Paul s home br br In a strange way and unexpectedly so It s all gone Pete Tong works much better as a simple drama in the line of Almost Famous Especially the scenes with Beatriz Batarda offer some acting power br br Conclusion it s a mess it somewhat entertains at a basic level but you better spend a night in your favorite club
This collection really sucks br br I rented it thinking I d really would enjoy some good fighting Man this sucked Quick flashy cuts an extremely annoying speaker and the fights them selves were heavily edited and shortened I m thinking especially of Jet Li s fight in Fists of legend and Jackie Chan s fight from drunken master 2 br br And what s the deal with those brawling streetfighters What s so cool about that I ve seen more interesting fights on Martial Law br br This a stupid collection of cuts for stupid people br br Do not ever buy this film Do not encourage the people who made this crap to make more of this crap br br Instead go buy the movies the fights were from and wath the fights in their uncut glory
Just because someone is under the age of 10 does not mean they are stupid If your child likes this film you d better have him her tested I am continually amazed at how so many people can be involved in something that turns out so bad This film is a showcase for digital wizardry AND NOTHING ELSE The writing is horrid I can t remember when I ve heard such bad dialogue The songs are beyond wretched The acting is sub par but then the actors were not given much Who decided to employ Joey Fatone He cannot sing and he is ugly as sin br br The worst thing is the obviousness of it all It is as if the writers went out of their way to make it all as stupid as possible Great children s movies are wicked smart and full of wit films like Shrek and Toy Story in recent years Willie Wonka and The Witches to mention two of the past But in the continual dumbing down of American more are flocking to dreck like Finding Nemo yes that s right the recent Charlie The Chocolate Factory and eye crossing trash like Red Riding Hood
Creepy lascivious wolf The young Red is wearing full make up and extremely short shorts robe Got about 20 minutes through and realized it could be a pedophile s dream come true The up beat music sounds a lot like something I d hear at a strip club I actually think this movie is a sick joke it s not a family movie Gross glad I was watching this with my daughter I don t want her to think it s normal for families to view quasi kiddie porn together Very bad Very sad it s sold as a family film Joey Fatone will probably be embarrassed he was in it And what s with advertising it as a special effects spectacular The effects do look low budget gawd awful
Relying on the positive reviews above we saw a free screening of this last night Now I KNOW that filmmakers plant positive reviews because there is no way an objective individual could have written these Destined to become a cult classic The theater was packed apparently with friends and families of the production crew because only a few of us walked out by the first hour br br The songs were the most literal I ve ever heard in a musical don t take the short cut honey there s a wolf in the woods Debi Mazar s eyes blinked furiously as she struggled to sing Fortunately most of the tunes lasted for only a few lines br br Now whoever plays the wolf in this tale should be charming and seductive Instead we get Joey Fatone ex N Syncer living up to his last name as he s not aged well He s not exactly lithe with his extra 50 pounds and junior high school quality makeup and out of tune singing Seriously this guy was in vocal group The rest of the actors are semi adequate but can t do much about the unimaginative script You know it is possible to write for adults and children at the same time see under Pixar br br On the positive side the virtual sets looked nice and were well integrated with the actors And it wasn t as offensive as Crash
The creativeness of this movie was lost from the beginning when the writers and directors left out a good story line only to substitute with horrible special affects This movie seemed to be focused on amusing children but couldn t even accomplish that Many small low budget films have the potential to become great movies but this movie is no where near that Fortunately this will be another film easily made and easily forgotten This movie was probably a chance for the actors to make a little money on the side until their chance came along for a real role in a good movie Anyone who has a shred of respect for films should avoid seeing this movie at all costs
This film is really vile It plays on the urban paranoia of the 70s 80s and puts it into a school context I m not saying that urban crime wasn t a problem for a lot of people or that schools weren t aren t problem areas but this vile piece of exploitation takes the biscuit Violence is beyond anything realistically imaginable but in this case it s not a case of social issues but a white upper middle class student uses it to turn himself into the crime kingpin of his local high schoiol And of course he knows how to play the system Does that sound familiar Yes This turd is pure violent exploitation a really nasty piece of work It s disturbing brutality dressed up as a social comment This belongs in the same category as trash like Exterminator Death Wish 2 5 and so on and so on The only remarkable thing is that Michael Fox was so broke at the time that he had to do stuff like this
Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn would roll over in their graves if they knew this Guess Who s Coming to Dinner Rip Off was actually in theaters Along with Sidney Poitier and Katherine Houghton these four brilliant actors made a great cultural statement with Director Stanley Kramer s 1967 master piece This present day rip off is a joke So a white guy from an overly stereotyped Italian family in Rhode Island brings his African American girlfriend home Insert GASP here to his grand father s funeral His family members reactions were of course predictable This movie was so painfully telegraphed from start to finish my girlfriend actually started fake snoring to signal to me that she wanted to leave Do yourself a favor and rent the original Take a pass on Wake
While some performances were good Victoria Rowell Adrienne Barbeau and the two Italian girlfriends come to mind the story was lame and derivative the emphasis on the girlfriend s racial background was handled clumsily at best and the relatives were mostly portrayed as stereotypes not as real people I found myself wincing uncomfortably at many moments that were supposed to be funny I can hardly comprehend why the local paper here in SF said this was a good movie and wonder WHO posted the glowing review here on IMDb Very disappointed in this movie and mad I actually went to a theatre to see it based on the faulty connection to Garden State which is a far funnier more inventive and touching movie than this one I must especially mention the emotional climax in the church which was so wooden and by the numbers that I nearly left and some in the audience actually DID THAT was followed by a silly climax at the graveyard which I saw coming 10 minutes before it happened I really don t like being misled to spend my money so uselessly
If you haven t seen this it s terrible It is pure trash I saw this about 17 years ago and I m still screwed up from it
This film is so ridiculously idiot that you may actually laugh at it But no even this is too much for this lost meters of celluloid I found it as an offer in a magazine and that s why I ve seen it I regret the time I lost to see this 1 out of 10 because they don t have a lower grade
It is hard to make an unbiased judgment on a film like this that had such an impact on me at such a young age This is with out a doubt the worst kind of exploitation film I was unfortunate enough to see this film for the first time in my youth Iwill never forget it I thought it was the most horrible movie ever made I then saw it again earlier this year and was once again horrified br br I am not a zealot or one to say what others should and should not see but I did take great offense to the way in which something as horrible as rape was dealt with in this movie I love lowbrow cinema but this is just plain nasty Rent some Rus Myer instead
Lipstick is another glossy movie failure I am trying to think of one good thing that I could say about the movie and I am having trouble coming up with something I guess the red dress that Margaux Hemingway was wearing in the end of the movie was the best part The writing and the script was not the worst that I have ever encountered but it could have been a lot better Lipstick was very pleasing to the eye to view The sets were very glossy and nice to look at The cast was okay I felt like Anne Bancroft s character was the only feasible character in the entire movie It was sad to see Chris Sarandon waste his time on this one
WARNING POSSIBLE SPOILER br br If you can get by the extremely unpleasant subject matter this film does offer a heaping helping of outrageously campy melodrama Surprisingly enough this movie has been copied and ripped off several times over the years although it s hard to fathom ANY filmmaker being inspired by this trashy drama Neither one of the Hemingway women can act here although Mariel HAS improved over the years Anne Bancroft offers the only touch of class as a prosecuting attorney and Chris Sarandon is by turns pathetic and unintentionally hilarious as the smirking smarmy bad guy of the piece br br Veteran director Lamont Johnson can t make a silk purse out of this sow s ear of a script which is stuffed to bursting with howlingly bad dialogue and outlandish situations For example the final sequence where Margaux grabs her shotgun and chases Sarandon down after his latest shocking act is meant to be exciting but elicits hearty chuckles instead Add a notoriously shrill and spacy musical score by Michel Polnareff and you have a true guilty pleasure even though you re likely to feel grubby and needing a hot shower after viewing it Don t say you weren t warned
Model Chris McCormack Margaux Hemingway is brutally raped by a teacher Chris Sarandon of her sister Kathy Mariel Hemingway He is brought to trial but goes totally free He then rapes Kathy br br Objectionable and sick rape film This movie was advertised as an important drama dealing with rape What it is is a badly written and for the most part badly acted drama It purports to be sympathetic to the victim of the rape but shoves the scene in our face To be totally honest however Hemingway s acting is so bad in that sequence that it loses any real impact it might have had The trial scenes were boring and predictable And the movie just went too far when 15 year old Mariel is raped thankfully that wasn t shown I do admit though that it did lead to a great ending when Margaux grabs a gun and shoots Sarandon dead But seriously having a young girl raped is just revolting br br Acting doesn t help For instance Margaux was no actress She was certainly a beautiful woman and an actual model I believe but her acting left a lot to be desired It lessens the film Mariel was just OK but this was one of her first films Sarandon does what he can as the rapist He wasn t bad but the terrible script worked against him br br I do remember hearing that at a screening of this back in 1976 some women stood up and cheered when Sarandon was killed so maybe this works for some people I found this boring simplistic and REALLY sick A 1 all the way
After seeing a heavily censored version of this movie on television years ago I was curious to see the unedited version I was surprised that it was more believable and well acted than I remembered but one thing really stood out I think other reviewers have mentioned this also namely what exactly is the nature and motivation of the Chris Sarandon character Has he raped other victims before Is he completely psychotic or an average sociopath How did he expect to get away with his attack on the younger sister Is this character at all credible or is it just a matter of more background being necessary He seems almost simultaneously to be an uncomfortably believable character and too crazy to actually be able to hold on to a teaching job that puts him in contact with young vulnerable girls This seems to to be the biggest complaint of viewers in general It has nothing to do with his performance which is terrifyingly convincing The movie occupies an uneasy position between sheer exploitation and a half way serious treatment of the subject without quite settling into either mode Not the worst movie ever made but not all that good either
Manipulative drama about a glamorous model Margaux Hemingway who is raped by a geeky but unbalanced musician Chris Sarandon to whom she had been introduced by her younger sister played by real life sibling Mariel whose music teacher he is While the central courtroom action holds the attention thanks largely to a commanding performance by Anne Bancroft as Hemingway s lawyer the film is too often merely glossy but also dramatically unconvincing the jury ostensibly takes the musician s side because a the girl invited assault due to the sensuous nature of her profession and b she was offering no resistance to her presumed aggressor when her sister arrived at the apartment and inadvertently saw the couple in bed together What the f she was clearly tied up what resistance could she realistically offer br br The second half of the film involving Sarandon s rape of the sister which curiously anticipates IRREVERSIBLE 2002 by occurring in a tunnel is rather contrived Mariel s character should have known better than to trust Sarandon after what he did to her sister but Margaux herself foolishly reprises the line of work which had indirectly led to her humiliating experience almost immediately The climax in which Sarandon gets his just desserts with Margaux turning suddenly into a fearless and resourceful vigilante is however a crowd pleaser in the style of DEATH WISH 1974 incidentally ubiquitous Italian movie mogul Dino De Laurentiis was behind both films br br It s worth noting how the two Hemingway sisters lives took wildly different turns this was the film debut of both Margaux s career never took off despite her undeniable good looks and commendable participation here while Mariel would soon receive an Oscar nomination for Woody Allen s MANHATTAN 1979 and interestingly would herself play a glamorous victim of raging violence when essaying the role of real life Playboy centerfold Dorothy Stratten in Bob Fosse s STAR 80 1983 With the added pressure of a couple of failed marriages Margaux took refuge in alcohol and would eventually die of a drug overdose in 1996 chillingly the Hemingway family had a history of suicides notably the sisters grandfather celebrated author Ernest who died of a self inflicted gunshot wound in 1961

When i got this movie free from my job along with three other similar movies I watched then with very low expectations Now this movie isn t bad per se You get what you pay for It is a tale of love betrayal lies sex scandal everything you want in a movie Definitely not a Hollywood blockbuster but for cheap thrills it is not that bad I would probably never watch this movie again In a nutshell this is the kind of movie that you would see either very late at night on a local television station that is just wanting to take up some time or you would see it on a Sunday afternoon on a local television station that is trying to take up some time Despite the bad acting cliché lines and sub par camera work I didn t have the desire to turn off the movie and pretend like it never popped into my DVD player The story has been done many times in many movies This one is no different no better no worse br br Just your average movie

There aren t many good things to say at all about Underneath Soderbergh s untrue endeavor into neo noir Soderbergh remakes Robert Siodmak s decent noir Criss Cross faithfully not altering the plot very much at all however the adaptation drains it of every ounce of its state of the art film noir atmosphere giving it the same story set in the very least appealing places lifestyles and anachronisms Soderbergh who would later make wonderful crime films like Out of Sight and the Ocean s series with great style and atmosphere takes the dangerously obvious route to modernization by renovating the story with the ugliest dullest and flattest fashions of the early 1990s Nightclubs have terrible revoltingly dressed garage bands Peter Gallagher s uninteresting version of Burt Lancaster s anti hero is left by his femme fatale girlfriend for compulsively buying cinematically lifeless modern appliances like stereos TVs and other up to date pieces of equipment that suck the reaction out of the film br br It could ve been more entertaining and less boring had it a few saving graces like a good score more flesh to its characters more than just William Fichtner giving performances that aren t wooden a crisper pace Unfortunately Underneath has none of these things Soderbergh a fine director does not utilize his dry detachment to the benefit of his film this time That disposition works wonderfully when he s helming a crime movie with more tongue in its cheek like the George Clooney pictures previously mentioned or a social or character drama like Traffic or sex lies and videotape With a movie like Underneath it intensifies the boredom experienced by the viewer
I read somewhere where this film was supposed to be a remake of the 1949 film noir Criss Cross I found the latter to be disappointing but it was still better than this film br br This movie is a neo noir since it s modern day and it s in color two things that purists would make it be disqualified for film noir status br br The biggest negative to it however wasn t the cinematography that was fine but the muddled storyline Hey some of 40s Dashiell Hammett stories were similar but I didn t care for some of those either The filmmakers here did not help the situation by placing flashbacks into the story what seemed like every three minutes No wonder it was the keep up with this story It was ridiculous What happens is that by the 45 minute mark their is so much confusion nobody cares anymore I know I didn t
Look it s the third one so you already know it s bad And Maniac Cop wasn t good enough to warrant the second installment so you know it s even worse But how much worse Awful approaching God awful br br When Maniac Cop goes on a killing spree a reporter exclaims What happened here can ONLY be described as a black rainbow of death br br 1 Rainbows are not black and can never be 2 Rainbows are harmless and can never inflict pain or death 3 A news reporter one valuable to his agency might find another way to describe the aftermath of a killing spree A black rainbow of death is not the ONLY way to describe the given situation br br This is what you re in for
The supernatural vengeful police officer is back for a third installment this time acting as guardian angel for a wrongfully accused female cop Standard stalk and slash picture yet well acted and directed thus making it oddly interesting and watchable though the violence isn t for the squeamish especially the director s cut which was originally given an NC 17 rating br br 1 2 out of
Matt Cordell is back from the dead for a third go round although I m not sure anyone cared at this point except for rabid MANICA COP fans Cordell who died in the last flick is resurrected through voodoo and is now hot on the trail of several miscreants involved in the shooting of a fellow officer Cordell is very fond of I missed part of this early 90s low budget quickie but it was pleasing to see Cordell wracking up the body count in various gruesome ways Problem is the overall film is pretty static and Cordell simply ain t Jason or Freddy The interest wanes pretty fast even with that grand B movie master Robert Forster as a doctor who ends up with his brains scrambled Stick with the first film in the series which is funny and scary and exciting all at the same time
I am at a distinct disadvantage here I have not seen the first two movies in this series although I have seen a lot of Larry Cohen films Fans of the series seem to think this is a good film Judging it on it s own it was pretty boring br br You never get a real good look at the maniac cop s Robert Z Dar face but what I did see was pretty grim The death scenes seem to be staged to eat up the most film not to give any thrills Maybe if I saw the NC 17 Director s Cut I may be more impressed br br The ending with the car chase with Z Dar Caitlin Dulany and Robert Davi was pretty intense best part of the movie
I always thought people were a little too cynical about these old Andy Hardy films A couple of them weren t bad Modern film critics are not ones who usually prefer nice to nasty so goody two shoes movies like these rarely get praise br br Nonetheless I can t defend this movie either You can still have an dated dialog but still laugh and cry over the story Watching this you just shake your head ask yourself how stupid can you get This is cornier than corny if you know what I mean It is so corny I cannot fathom too many people actually sitting through the entire hour and a half br br The story basically is Andy Mickey Rooney trying to get out of jam because he makes up some story about involved with some débutante from New York City as if that was the ultimate People were a lot more social conscious in the old days You d hear the term social climber as if knowing rich or beautiful people was the highest achievement you could make it life It s all utter nonsense of course and looks even more so today br br However it s about as innocent and clean a story and series there were a half dozen of these Andy Hardy films made as you could find Also if you like to hear Judy Garland sing then this is your ticket as she sings a couple of songs in here and she croons her way into Andy s heart Oh man I almost throw up even writing about this
ANDY HARDY MEETS DEBUTANTE 1940 is the ninth 9th film of the series and it shows the direction it was inevitably headed into Characters ANDY HARDY Mickey Rooney and JUDGE HARDY Lewis Stone were going to be front and center The rest of the cast was going too just punch the clock and collect their checks The series would rise to the occasion again and have its moments but a fatal decline had set in br br Lewis Stone throughout the series would continue too portray the character of JUDGE HARDY in a sympathetic manner The rest of the cast would be professional even though given less and less to do Mickey Rooney on the other hand would continue his character as if there was no learning curve ANDYs reaction to any situation was in a naive and unbelievable way Even after he returned as a veteran of World War II service in LOVE LAUGHS AT ANDY HARDY 1946 his reaction to any teapot tempest was the same juvenile br br In this film it is clearly illustrated ANDY gets himself into several unbelievable situations that with a simple explanation would have been resolved This screen writing device was known as the idiot plot A means of stretching a poorly written scenario Maybe it was less Mickey Rooneys fault then the Director and the Writers Most likely George B Seitz had directed one too many and a firmer hand was needed too control Rooneys excesses To see our overview of the entire series go to YOU RE ONLY YOUNG ONCE 1937
I must say this movie is a Mork and Mindy knock off when watching it i got the chills I even wet myself a little When that Korean guy with the spiders in his neck started kicking people i was like oh my lord Asian people smell and suck cause they eat dogs all the time Any way back on track Chuck had a somewhat terrible performance and lacked the intelligence of a regular non robotic human being Some people would compare it to his earlier days when he was a car wash analyzer and believed in the holy ghost and the ghost of Christmas past This movie is so bad I put my new born child in a box and left it in Mr Norris mailbox He can raise my kid I m not letting him into a world where he thinks chuck Norris is a karate expert Ill let him see what that hack is like in real life for the rest of his life
The shame of it There I was comfortable in the arm chair with a beer and a bag of popcorn bouyant in the hope of another splendid Muppet night of entertainment What did I get Disappointed How can the Muppets go from the sublime Christmas Carol to this The humour was dreadful the songs were worse than Country and Western and that s saying something and the plot was as confused and poor as Blind Pew I think the main problem was that they bit off too much in attempting Treasure Island A short tale such as Christmas Carol is perfect because you can weave the Muppet high jinks around it here the need to drag the plot along stopped all the fun Where do the Muppets go next How about Muppets Wizard of Oz
The Treasure Island DVD should be required viewing in any film production course It s a textbook example of how NOT to make a movie Watching the movie and then listening to the writer director s commentary demonstrates graphically the vast chasm between what he knows about the characters and what he communicates to his audience about them Call me old fashioned but I think of movies as a means of communication and communication isn t complete if the audience doesn t know what the hell the director is talking about The director s avowed purpose is to make a movie void of Hollywood conventions Among those conventions alas is consistency of character and clarity of concept The director himself realizes that audiences often don t understand points where he has purposely avoided a Hollywood cliché However he never seems to grasp the idea that clichés exist for a reason They are shorthand for conveying complex ideas quickly and clearly It s fine to avoid them but they need to be replaced with some other way of communicating the same idea not simply eliminated The film is built on an intriguing premise rich with potential Two puppets are assigned to fabricate a personality and background for an unidentified corpse that is to be used in a disinformation mission in the closing days of WWII Soon each begins to populate their personal fantasies with the character and their invention becomes increasingly real to them Someone with less disdain for the Hollywood convention of traditional storytelling could create a wonderful film with this idea This film certainly isn t it The puppets do everything they can to bring consistency to these characters but they are all too often defeated by the dazed and confused script In particular I m becoming increasingly impressed by Gonzo who plays the lively corpse In a number of muppet films he always stands out as a very charismatic puppet
Alicianne Laurel Barnett becomes a live in babysitter for young Rosalie Nordon Rosalione Cole who has recently lost her mother But Rosalie misses her dead mother a lot and continuously visits her grave conveniently located in a cemetery right behind the house late at night where she also meets her friends br br This starts off good with a truly eerie sequence in the cemetery then falls apart The story is thin and there is TONS of padding to make the film 85 minutes long The acting is terrible across the board with Cole easily being the worst Badly directed with some of the WORST editing I ve ever seen in a motion picture Scenes and sound are just cut off with no rhyme or reason Also the film has terrible and obvious post production sound br br As for blood and violence forget it There s very little and what there is looks incredibly fake I ve NEVER seen such fake looking blood looks like ketchup Boring pointless a rightfully forgotten drive in movie You can skip this one
If you re going to look after a child make sure they don t live anywhere near a graveyard Especially if said kid has a habit of drawing gory pictures and disappears at night among the tombstones to see her friends But our long haired heroine oblivious to all the signs shacks up with her family the Nortons which include a strict father and a dullard older brother who becomes a love interest for our budding babysitter Even more spooky than the zombie gang outside is the cast s tendency to talk even when their lips aren t moving and for the words to not match the movement of their mouths But enough of that domestic animals are being sacrificed old ladies are having eyeballs torn out and the orchestra won t shut up during any scene even the quiet ones Oh and the editor is having a day off going by the way the film drones on br br In fact it would been better if everybody involved had taken a breather smelt what they d signed up for and gone AWOL Yes I know it s hard to get into movies these days but this sort of starter point is not one on your CV you d want If would be like a trainee farm labourer having a conviction for chicken molesting Featuring one of the worst lead performances ever by the shrill Laurel Barnett and another almost equally as bad by the charisma free child actress Rosalie Cole The next Dakota Fanning she ain t the film meanders on and on with nothing but padding until we get what passes for a climax br br This involves five or six members of the undead barricading our utterly useless heroine in a shed while her bit of rough fends off these ghouls with a plank of wood a one shell shotgun and whatever he can lay his hands on But back up a minute earlier on they were in the car and they accidentally discovered that the creatures found the noise of the horn so repellent they shuffled off at the sound of it So do they stay where they are safe No of course not they run off to this abandoned building in the middle of nowhere so the bloke can prove what a hardnut he is the girl can act like she s having a nervous breakdown br br Finally the film closes It doesn t end it just goes to a grinding halt The main character wanders back to her vehicle covered in fake blood as if nothing horrible had happened But my dear viewer something horrible has happened You have just sat through one of the most lamebrained boring horror films you re ever likely to see and lost 82 minutes of your life you ll never get back Just think years from now on your deathbed what you d trade an hour and 22 minutes for just to spend a bit of extra time with your family Sadly it s already too late for me Don t you make the same mistake 2 10
And that comes from someone that will withstand almost ANY viewing The acting and sound is awful This might qualify for a so bad it s good point of merit for some However I take my horror movies seriously and this is just crap it s just soooo cheap I think that s my major complaint The dialogue is often hilarious attention to how many times you startled me is used The child actress is seriously god awful I pray her acting career ended here her line DONUTS I HATE DONUTS is worth repeated viewing however
This movie was seriously awful The acting was the worst It was worse than a student film Super cheesy and I think the worst actor was the old lady At first I thought to myself well it s an old movie Then I remembered that that is no excuse I ve seen older movies with way better acting and such br br The music was terrible to It was really choppy The editing was poor most of the dialog was out of sync br br Overall this movie doesn t even deserve a 1 I only watched it because I was so bored and the movie hardly entertained me It was just laughable My dead grandmother s left pinkie toe could make a better movie than this
There were a lot of truly great horror movies produced in the seventies but this film certainly isn t one of them It s a shame The Child isn t better as it works from a decent idea that takes in a couple of sometimes successful horror themes We have the idea of a vengeful child which worked so well in classic films such as The Bad Seed and then we have the central zombie theme which of course has been the backbone of many a successful horror movie The plot is basically this young girl blames a load of people for the death of her mother so she goes to the graveyard and raises the dead to get revenge as you do This is all well and good except for the fact that it s boring Nothing happens for most of the film and although it does pick up at the end with some nice gore it s not enough of a finale to justify sitting through the rest of it The film was obviously shot on a budget as the locations look cheap and all the actors are rubbish There s really not much I can say about the film overall as there isn t much to it The Child is a dismal seventies horror flick and I certainly don t recommend it
A little girl lives with her father and brother in the middle of the countryside This little girl Rosalie has some psychotic tendencies as the movie opens with her feeding kittens to some kind of creatures in the cemetery and she has recently lost her mother who went crazy but whilst alive enjoyed staying in the woods all night The premise of the film has a new young lady coming to Rosalie to take care of her She is introduced to the evil of the woods while driving and imagine the suspense here experiences a huge blue barrel falling over the side of a cliff to somehow stop her car dead in its tracks From there she walks to the nearest house and discovers Mrs Whitfield who then goes into a whole lot of explanation about Rosalie and her family The earnestness exuded by the Mrs Whitfield character has to be seen to be believed Well the young lady meets up with the child and we soon learn that not only is she strange but everyone in the film is very bizarre as well They all do share one thing in common which is none of them ever heard of an acting school None of these people can act as evidenced by the few vehicles any of them in the entire film appeared in before or since and all of them look like they have little idea what is going on pause to remember lines and have all the conviction of a paper bag The director plods through the material in a slow pace with this horrible piano music crescendoing here and there at things that are suppose to be scary It takes us a bit before we get to a couple of murders by the creature friends but by that time I didn t care The murders are not convincing either and truth be told the whole film looks like someone through it together on their friend s farm with the people and things on hand there That all being said the ending does have some creepy aspects to it though we don t learn one darn thing about why Rosalie is like this or more importantly who the creature with the cheap masks are Cheap doesn t even begin to describe the budget here with It basically is a couple old farmhouses and some sheds at the end and of course the woods Someone lent the director a couple old cars too No special effects of any kind and only the most minimal make up There are so many guffaws ridiculous moments to list but I will just list a few here that at the very least made me chuckle from the lack of aptitude from the creative powers involved 1 Watch the gardener s body well after he has been slain Len comes in and sees him butchered and you can see his fat belly heave with life 2 the dying scene at the end where the actress playing Rosalie is killed She looks like she is listening to directions and takes her sweet time dying considering the method 3 How about the guy playing Roaslie s father giving us a cranky poor man s Andy Griffith The scene where he is laughing about boy scouts dying was a weird hoot The Child is indeed a very bad film and is very bad even for the standards of 70 s cheese if you will This isn t a B film but more like a Z film with producer Harry Novak making some money on virtually nothing
I m not going to say that this movie is horrible because I have seen worse but it s not even halfway decent br br The plot is very confusing I couldn t really figure out what was happening and where things were going When the movie was over I was left scratching my head I watched through to the end of the credits to see if they had something after them that may clear things up but once the credits were over that was it I felt like I was jarred from one weak plot point to another throughout the whole movie with little or no transition between the two br br Character development is very shallow I couldn t figure out when somebody was angry or had a grudge against someone I couldn t tell if half of the characters were just supposed to be drunk stoned mentally challenged or they just had a bad actor to portray them This film seems to be based around stereotypes to it s credit they are hard to avoid using when you are making a film about a singer in a rock band which SHOULD make character development easier since so many other films have already illustrated the suffering of an abused child or the trials of a heroin addict trying to come clean Stereotypes are easy to depict which would explain why so many bad films tend to overuse stereotypical characters This film on the other hand uses stereotypical characters left and right but then tries to keep them as incomprehensible as possible br br Another problem with the characters is that they seemed to be dismissed with no explanation I guess that s OK because so little time was spent developing the characters that I really didn t get a chance to know any of them so I never really missed any of them br br And last but not least was Sadie s singing It s awful The music backing her up is not prize winner but it is usually drowned out by the screeches that are released from Sadie s vocal cords I swear that there s one point in the movie where she sings a song for at least 10 minutes I seriously thought I was going to have to turn it off during this howl a thon br br As a whole this movie is confusing Characters are ill developed Georgia s acting is wooden and stiff Sadie s character is yanked from one bad situation to another with no back story or explanation The music was unbearable and I can think of no good reasons to see this film unless you have a thirst for cinematic pain
Jennifer Jason Leigh and Mare Winningham are a good match portraying vastly different siblings but only Winningham is able to bring something convincing or substantial to her role Leigh playing bar band singer and alcoholic Sadie Flood constantly leans on older sis Georgia an acclaimed folk singer in the Joni Mitchell mold Perhaps due to her double duties as co producer on the film Leigh seems to have boxed herself into a corner she isn t credible as a singer and even if this is intentional gives herself far too much screen time at the microphone Probably hoping for a tour de force Leigh is wire drawn and nervous and jagged however we simply do not see any talent within this character Leigh is obviously a solid actress but she makes decisions here that wall us off from her If Sadie had even the slightest bit of charisma or appeal we might be able to buy into the concept that she gets the small breaks that she does As it is the likelihood of her ever getting up on stage is slim Director Ulu Grosbard crafts a few intense dramatic sequences and the editing at the finale juxtaposes Sadie s bar performance with Georgia s sold out arena show both singing the same song and it s a sadly nuanced moment but really what s the point 1 2 from
I don t remember Barnaby Jones being no more than a very bland standard detective show in which as per any Quinn Martin show Act I was the murder Act II was the lead character figuring out the murder Act III was the plot twist another character murdered Act IV was the resolution and the Epilogue was Betty Lee Meriwether asking her father in law Barnaby Jones Buddy Ebsen how he figured out the crime and then someone saying something witty at the end of the show br br One thing I do remember was the late great composer Jerry Goldsmith s excellent theme song Strangely the opening credit sequence made me want to see the show off and on for the seven seasons the show was on the air I will also admit that it was nice to see Ebsen in a role other than Jed Clampett despite Ebsen being badly miscast I just wished the show was more entertaining than when I first remembered it br br Update 1 11 2009 I watched an interview with composer Jerry Goldsmith on YouTube through their Archive of American Television channel Let s just say that I was more kind than Goldsmith about the show Barnaby Jones
Yes AWA wrestling how can anyone forget about this unreal show First they had a very short interviewer named Marty O Neil who made Rock n Roll Buck Zumhofe look like a nose tackle Then it was Gene Okerland who when he got mad as the wrestler would say either Were out of time or Well be right back acting like he was mad but actually sounding forced After he went to the WWF Ken Resneck took over even though his mustache looked like week old soup got stuck to it was a very fine interviewer who Georgeous Jimmy Garvin called mouse face which made me fall off my chair laughing After he jumped ship then Larry Nelson came on board which he was so bad that Phyllis George would of been an improvement Then there s Doug McLeod the best wrestling announcer ever who made every match exciting with his description of blows Then he was offered more pay by the Minnesota North Stars hockey team At ringside who can forget Roger Kent who s mispronouncing of words and sentences were historic Like when a wrestler was big Hes a big on punched or kicked in the guts right in the gussets or when kicked He punted him or the piledriver should be banned after Nick Bockwinkle used it on a helpless opponent Right Roger like you care After he left to greener money WWF they had Rod Trongard who s announcing style was great but different Like when a wrestler scraped the sole of his boot across another guys forehead he d say Right across the front e lobe or when a wrestler is in trouble Hes in a bad bad way He also would say AWA the baddest toughest meanest most scientific wrestlers are here right in the AWA No extra money Verne Gagne After he left WWF Larry Wheres Phyllis Nelson took over and I would talk to someone else or totally ignore him WWE wisely didn t take him Also Greg Gagne had the ugliest wrestling boots I ever saw a yellow color of something I don t want to say Also when hes looking for the tag he looks like he wants to get it over with so that he can run to the nearest restroom Jumpin Jim Brunzell was such a great dropkick artist that you wonder why Greg was ever his partner Jerry Blackwell RIP was also a superstar wrestler but you wonder why Verne had himself win against him Puhleeeeze Then when Vince McMahon would hire Gagnes jobbers he would make most of them wrestle squash matches I like to see the Gagne family say wrestlings real now
Any film which begins with a cowhand shagging a female calf can t promise much As for the stereotyping of the kibbutz as it was 50 yrs ago well I was there and it just wasn t like that OK every kibbutz had just a small piece of something shown in the film like youngsters raiding the kitchen at night but you can t show the whole kibbutz as being full of all those shall we say naughty traits Each kibbutz had its own problems but hardly any kibbutz had all of them The views of Israel were great I still remember my youth in that Garden of Eden called the Emek valley Yes and the acting was good too so you see it wasn t all black just a wrong portrayal probably on purpose too
I saw this movie just now not when it was released and hailed as best picture of the year here in Israel and to summarize everything right now I will just say this is not a good film br br This is Dror Shaul s second feature film and I have to admit that his first and the TV drama he made before this picture are much better further more this is his first attempt at directing a drama the early works were comedies and were funny and effective br br The first thing you have to know if you ll ever see this film Israel of the 21st century hates the kibbutz and the values it represented since the formation of the state of Israel the real situation of the kibbutzim is very dire and some of them disappear one by one the kibbutz Hebrew word for collective was a sort of village for members only where the values of equality and socialism were the dogma for everyday life with the change in social values with time it seems now that the kibbutz was a place where the human spirit was repressed locked within the dogma rules with no ticket out the entrance of capitalist values and way of life in the 90 s and so far made it very hard on the kibbutzim to survive the crazy mother in the film is the central metaphor for that br br But I regard this film as having nothing to do with nostalgia for the good old days of the kibbutz once it was a dream of every young couple to live in a kibbutz and raise children in this quite and beautiful environment but the film shows the opposite that the kibbutz with it s socialist dogma was a place sort of like a cult of crazy people with crazy ideas that undermine the freedom of each individual within the collective this is the central philosophy of post modern capitalism your individuality is the most important thing you must place yourself in the center and no one else but you is the matter this is the philosophy the film stands for and that s just it s first sin br br If you disagree with me on the political side I m sure you will agree that the acting the tone of the film it s script and it s direction are the four sins that follow the film has no real visual text and none of it s shots is something to remember it is also very delicate a delicacy that is no more than artsy fartsy attempt to provoke emotions which do not surface not in the film and not with the viewer it brings nothing but boredom br br Can someone please explain why this film won so many prizes maybe because it shows that Israel is in line with the rest of the world hating socialist and human values or maybe it shows that Israel is a delicate place not giving in to dogmas and fanaticism that we are basically very human and good people capable of emotions especially when they are fake ones just like capitalism expects us to be or maybe because it tells one of the biggest lies of Israeli cinema in recent years a lie that undermines the justification of the existence of the Jewish state no matter what the answer is it s not a good one not for the world not for human values and not for the Jews
Tainted look at kibbutz life br br This film is less a cultural story about a boy s life in a kibbutz but the deliberate demonization of kibbutz life in general In the first two minutes of the movie the milk man in charge of the cows rapes one of his calves And it s all downhill from there in terms of the characters representing typical kibbutznikim Besides the two main characters a clinically depressed woman and her young son every one else in the kibbutz is a gross caricature of well evil br br The story centers on how the kibbutz like some sort of cult slowly drags the mother and son deeper into despair and what inevitably follows There is no happiness no joy no laughter in this kibbutz Every character situation represents a different horrific human vice like misogyny hypocrisy violence cultism repression etc For example while the protagonist is a strikingly handsome European looking 12 year old boy his older brother is a typical kibbutz youth complete with his jewish physical appearance and brutish personality He cares more about screwing foreign volunteers than the health of his dying mother He treats these volunteers like trash After his little brother pleads of him to visit his dying mother whom he hasn t seen in a long time due to his military service he orders Quote Linda go take shower and I cum in two minutes br br There is one other good character in this movie a European foreigner who plays the mother s boyfriend When the animal rapist tries to hit the mother s son the boyfriend defends him by breaking the rapist s arm He is summarily kicked out of the kibbutz then for violent behavior against one of the kibbutz members More hypocrisy The indescribably annoying French woman who plays the school teacher preaches that sex cannot happen before age 18 or without love and gives an account of the actual act that s supposed to be humorous for the audience but is really just stupid She of course is screwing the head of the kibbutz in the fields who then in turn screws the little boy s mom when her mental health takes a turn for the worse br br The film portrays the kibbutz like some sort of cult Children get yanked out of their beds in the middle of the night and taken to some ritual where they swear allegiance in the fields overseen by the kibbutz elders The mother apparently can t escape the kibbutz although in reality anyone was is always free to come and go as they choose It s a mystery how the boy s father died but you can rest assured the kibbutz drove him to it and his surviving parents are another pair of heartless wretched characters that weigh down on the mother and her son br br That s the gist of this movie One dimensional characters over dramatization dry performances and an insidious message that keeps trying to hammer itself into the audience s head that kibbutz life was degrading miserable and even deadly for those who didn t fit in I feel sorry for the guy who made this film obviously he had a bad experience growing up in a kibbutz But I feel as though he took a few kernels of truth regarding kibbutz life and turned them into huge atomic stereotyped bombs
There just isn t enough here There a few funny spots but not really enough I was very disappointed because I love stupid movies I was expecting this to be a hidden gem IT WAS NOT It was a hidden turd br br The whole time I was watching it I was thinking Geez I could do better than that and I m a moron Don t believe the few good reviews I was suckered in by them At no point did I laugh at loud Maybe this was funny or cutting edge in 1987 but man it fell flat today This movie had promise it just didn t deliver on it Maybe if they rewrote it a few more times I cant fault the actors They weren t the best but they just didn t have much with which to work This movie failed because of threadbare writing SORELY disappointed
Mark Pirro s Deathrow Gameshow of 1987 is a black comedy that is extremely cheesy in many parts but occasionally very funny nevertheless This movie could certainly have been a lot better the acting is terrible and some extremely cheesy scenes make it hard to watch at times but the concept is funny and it has some hilarious moments br br In the near future the year 1991 game shows have changed Chuck Todean John Mc Cafferty hosts a game show called Live Or Die in which convicted death row inmates have the chance to play for their lives and for money Candidates who fail get executed on the air using many different methods such as guillotines electric chairs and other more bizarre devices of execution followed by applause from the cheering studio audience The show is of course more than controversial and Chuck has made lots of enemies br br Deathrow Gameshow is incredibly cheesy and crappy in many aspects and the acting is terrible but it is without doubt fun in many parts especially if you re a fan of dark humor You haven t missed anything if you haven t seen it but it is definitely funny and a good time waster 4 10
I rented this film to see what might be a bloody non stop action movie and got this overly sentimental and super cheap low budget action drama that makes Kickboxer look like Die Hard Lou and Reb are in Vietnam and as Lou saves Reb from the gooks he gets shot in the head in what is easily one of the worst effects ever The Vietnam scenes are shot in someones backyard I swear Lou is now brain damaged and Reb and him live together and own a bar Super homoerotic Lou is convinced to fight in a cage for money and Reb goes on a killing spree to get him back There is no good fight scenes at all the punches are two inches away from a person Characters personalities change in matter of seconds One guy is a bad and in the next scene he s good The acting is horrid and the music is some overly sentimental Frank Stallone sounding song that would make you sick I hated this film
Cage 1989 was another one of those low budget buddy action flicks that were produced during the 80 s thanks in large part due to the films such as 48hrs and Lethal Weapon This one stars Reb Brown and Lou Ferrigno as to former Vietnam Vets who happen to run a local dive bar Reb takes care of Lou because he saved his life in Nam But Lou was shot in the head and is now pretty soft Although he s huge Lou has the brain of a child One day some ruffians throw their wait around in the bar and Lou and Rebb beat the tar out of them But payback s a mother They crash the bar leaving Lou and Reb with nothing That is until these two thugs come into the picture one of them s a real nice guy who have a plan in mind br br The film s a waste of time Maybe if they went all they way and made a hard core action flick instead of trying to tone down the gruesomeness of the situation perhaps it could have worked Alas it doesn t and the audience is left holding the bag Oh well It s too bad because you have all the elements for a great B movie Better luck next time I guess br br Not recommended br br xxx
If you want to laugh like crazy rent Cage Cage is about two war heroes Billy and Scott who are best friends When Billy is shot in Vietnam he is unable to fend for himself so Scott takes him in br br I have never seen a movie with more gay references to the two main characters Billy and Scott love to wrestle and Scott tells Billy that he is still sore from last night among other things br br Wonderful catch phrases like Shut the sh t up and Ping Pang Pong cut the sh t will keep you laughing for hours The native American guys that are supposed to be playing Mexican gang members are also top notch As they say it s party time right now Ba ba ba ba ba ba I could go on forever but just watch this movie and laugh your a off It was so funny I went out and bought the DVD for 5 99
I don t know what you guys are inhaling but please stop This movie was complete trash br br Macaulay Culkin as Kevin McCallister was lovable cute sweet loving and extremely fun to watch He had that innocence but at the same time he was strong as well br br This new kid Alex Annoying as all hell Just a blatant ripoff at trying to match Culkin s charm and grace failing miserably at that br br The villains complete crap Harry and Marv they were such an entertaining on screen team They were comedic they were humorous and just made you really want to root for Culkin even more which is what a good villain is suppose to do These guys Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern absolutely PERFECT for those roles On the other hand in 3 we have 4 new idiots that just bicker and again try to capitalize on the charisma and duo charm of the first villains Not saying they were horrible but they were not memorable or even really that entertaining More on the corny side actually br br Then we got the actual movies Part 1 and 2 classics Memorable Perfect to watch around Christmas and brings a wonderful Christmas feeling and brings out so many emotions It makes you fall in love with the story and care about the characters Simply memorable and close to being masterpieces Part 3 Masterpiece of crap Enough said br br All and all I don t know why people like this I think people really don t know what a good movie is anymore Its a crappy sequel rip off with more unrealistic traps and a stupid new main character kid that I wish the robbers would of at least beat the crap out of br br Run run away from this garbage And lets not even start with Part 4
Whoever thought that ANOTHER Home Alone film would be a good idea should have their head examined Same plot different kid more villains which leads to MORE endless stupidity in the traps The other two films were bad enough and this is where it hits rock bottom People may as well watch the other films for plot as it s all identical
I hated this movie It was absolutely horrible poor poor PITIFUL acting REAL REAL REAL stupid criminals that weren t even the LEAST BIT funny unlike the first 2 home alone movies that were very good all the boobie traps are weak pathetic excuses for ideas poorly copied of of the first two which just meant that the people writing this movie were just lazy because their paycheck didn t go above 20 bucks a week This movie is absolutely lousy it s not worth even renting In fact don t even watch it on t v Go use your eyes in a more useful way by seeing the first two I BARELY give this 1 star out of 10 Just trust me when I say if you liked the first two and you are not a complete stupid person you will not like this movie do not watch this movie
I loved the first two movies but this movie was just a waste of time and money for me and the studio I m still wondering why they made this horrible movie The thing with the plastic gun and with the toy car that can go into another house are ridiculous Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern in the first two movies were so funny but the terrorists in this one are so stupid and not funny Believe me this movie is just a waste of time
Remembering the dirty particulars of this insidiously vapid movie is akin to digging into your chest cavity with a rusty salted spoon Perhaps Home Alone 2 Lost in New York 1992 was a bit on the predictable side but this pathetic excuse for a film is just one of the most shameless bids at commercialization I have ever heard of A boy fighting off spies terrorists when he s home alone in a Chicago suburb with the chickenpox Ridiculous Why did this film have to be made I am the kind of person who believes even terrible movies are not wastes of time but rather learning experiences However this is actually a waste of time It should be avoided at all costs
Home Alone 3 is one of my least favourite movies It s the cream of the crop or s if you tend to be more cynical as it ranks up or down there with stuff like Battlefield Earth and Flinstones Viva Rock Vegas In fact it could even be worse than those two since those two at least intermittently made me laugh at their stupidity This just made me cringe in pain constantly and clap when the credits started rolling No other movie has made me cringe in pain Now I will point out exactly why this movie is so incredibly atrocious br br First off the plot is ridiculous It revolves around a chip in a remote control car that is misplaced and how these terrorists want it Dumb stuff br br The action that ensues is similar to that of the other two Home Alones with boobytraps and all but watching these boobytraps being executed is rather than being funny incredibly unpleasant to watch I didn t laugh or even so much as smile once rather I cringed constantly and hoped that the terrorists would nail the kid The bird rather than providing comic relief was unfunny and annoying br br The acting as done by a bunch of no names ranges from poor to atrocious There is not a single good performance here Alex D Linz is absolutely unlikeable and unfunny as the kid while the terrorists act and judging by their movie credits look as they ve been hastily picked off the street and well that s it br br I can see some people saying Man it s for the kids Don t dis it man Well MAN kids may like this but they can get a hell of a lot better See Monsters Inc and Toy Story before even considering getting this out Hell even Scooby Doo and Garfield which suck see those reviews for more are better than this br br So in short this is an irredeemably atrocious movie This was clearly recycled for the money as it almost completely rips off the first two the only thing is it completely insults the first two as well No human kid or otherwise should find any reason to see Home Alone 3 Ever It s THAT bad br br 0 5 stars
I would like to say that curiosity got the best of me If only I saw a trailer I d be able to tell you the whole plot of the movie I could have saved myself the most pointless one hour and forty minutes in my entire life and about twenty dollars This movie was a disaster waiting to happen and it is an embarrassment to Hollywood br br The movie displays a vivid ignorance of reality For example this kid s remote control race car goes all over the neighborhood and even enters this house It s even covered with clothes Is it not rational to believe that a remote can no longer transmit a signal under those circumstances Hollywood obviously did not believe so Common logic and any concept of electronics dictates the opposite I doubt the race car could even have reached the street let alone a house across the street Another unrealistic trait is the lack of intelligence the criminals possess Why is it in all these movies these criminals are rocket scientists until they encounter an eight year old The kid is meant to be the most intelligent person in the movie instead of professional terrorists Please there s more reality in The Matrix Also the leader puts down his real pistol and accidentally picks up a plastic pistol apparently he could not tell the difference Even with a glove on one should be able to do that Just because they look the same does not mean anything there is other senses then sight The traps are unrealistic as well if any one of them actually worked the criminals would be dead But Hollywood intends for us to laugh at the funny results of the traps I did not laugh I sighed and rolled my eyes br br But I recommend this movie to anyone who thinks they have seen a really bad movie the movie they saw will seem like Citizen Kane compared to this one Otherwise skip this one for the sake of your pride Home Alone 3 also raises a question We all know Alex D Linz stars in the movie but did he write it as well
This is the worst ripoff of Home Alone movies that I have EVER seen Watch part 1 and two but don t let anyone say that this is BETTER than the first two I mean really you don t make a movie then make a sequel with the same characters and actors and then make another sequel with DIFFERENT characters and actors I mean it would have been OK if this wan t a Home Alone movie but they DID make it a Home Alone movie Culkin is too old now so you re suppose to STOP making sequels Goodness this movie makes me SICK Buy part 1 and 2
I like to keep my reviews short and simple but this pretty much sums it up You can not beat the original two for a number of reasons one of which including the directing talent of Chris Columbous br br This movie had terrible directing covered up by even more terrible acting I cant even believe these people are considered actors br br Painful to sit through and watch The storyline was a complete joke about a secret chip and Russian terrorists on a painstaking quest to get it back Horrible rent one of the original tow and enjoy yourself br br The movie wasn t even set during Christmas like the original Home Alone was turned from an excellent Christmas time family comedy movie to a joke with no moral or plot
In 1987 John Hughes wrote and directed Planes Trains and Automobiles which was a hilarious and poignant comedy the best thing he s ever done Ten years on he s reduced to again recycling the plot of Home Alone in this second sequel which is not connected to the other films but is equally uninspired and sadistic The four crooks that s right four And one of them is a girl Congratulations Hughes for introducing this revolutionary change to the series are electrocuted with metal chairs brained with barbells and blinded with paint ha ha ha haaaaaaaa ha while the new kid is even less charming than Culkin You d think that the departure of almost all the key players from the first two films would stop Hughes from fossilising the same old routines but the only surprise is that not even he turned up for Home Alone 4
Alex D Linz replaces Macaulay Culkin as the central figure in the third movie in the Home Alone empire Four industrial spies acquire a missile guidance system computer chip and smuggle it through an airport inside a remote controlled toy car Because of baggage confusion grouchy Mrs Hess Marian Seldes gets the car She gives it to her neighbor Alex Linz just before the spies turn up The spies rent a house in order to burglarize each house in the neighborhood until they locate the car Home alone with the chicken pox Alex calls 911 each time he spots a theft in progress but the spies always manage to elude the police while Alex is accused of making prank calls The spies finally turn their attentions toward Alex unaware that he has rigged devices to cleverly booby trap his entire house Home Alone 3 wasn t horrible but probably shouldn t have been made you can t just replace Macauley Culkin Joe Pesci or Daniel Stern Home Alone 3 had some funny parts but I don t like when characters are changed in a movie series view at own risk
The first Home Alone was a decent enough film the sequel was pretty much the same at a new setting This one tries to be original and succeeds to some degree of course the formula is basically the same so it s like watching the same movie for a third time with slightly altered plot The new score is quite bad though the new setting traps piece was if nothing else interesting and different especially compared to the grand score of the first and the almost but not quite as good score of the second It almost makes up for it by using some pretty good non original music but it s just not the same The plot is fair and somewhat original to the franchise but it s still basically the same movie as the first two with worse acting and a less impressive example of the scary character turning out to be good The acting is mostly unimpressive The characters are mostly caricatures The new thieves are less entertaining than the old ones and they make fun of spy stuff which is almost criminal given the limited amount of good spy flicks there are and how precious few of them are cool The fact that there are more of them and thereby more traps is just a weak attempt at trying to go one higher than the first two films and it doesn t work The idea behind the thieves and their mission is a tad too adult and serious for a children s film and there was a sexual joke or two though that isn t the first time in the series It s also unnecessarily complex as is the plot in general I could follow it but I doubt a kid could Some of the exposition are delivered so obviously that even children may find it stupid The animal stuff is generally not amusing There are fewer siblings which should mean that those there are get developed more but they have less personality than the least featured of those of the first two films All in all just not particularly good or worth watching unless you really love watching criminals getting hurt in cartoon y violence I recommend this to huge fans of the series only 3 10
Home Alone 3 is the first of the Home Alone movies not to feature Culkin in the main role and the same villains However the plot is very similar to the original Home Alone film Instead of two comical villains we get three or four of them This film involves some traps but it also has a long scene with a remote control car The slapstick humour is consistent as well but the young boy and the villains really fail to make an impact in this film No pun intended This film offers nothing new or different than the previous films did and there really is not the warm holiday feeling or subplots that the other two films had It s more of a pure comedy but it did not succeed in making me laugh as the characters really did not do it for me I would not recommend this film it s pretty boring If you are seeking a good holiday family film with comedy then watch the original Home Alone movie
Beating the bad guys Again is the tag line for this movie it exposes so much truth about it br br Home Alone one and two film classics Home Alone three and four a good film if you re three Like Sharkboy and Lavagirl as hard as it tries to be funny it s not Culkin is replaced by Alex D Linz or something else He s a very bland actor with bland performances but it s not entirely his fault the writing called for bland vocabulary and bland expressions The pranks are just copied from the first two with different crooks and you d have to be blind to think those chicken pox are real A good choice if you are a preschool teacher in which is showing this film on a rainy day And to make things worst a totally different cast go see if you don t believe me but you ll regret it
The first Home Alone was one of the funniest movies of the 90 s The second was just as funny with the same cast and jokes Now comes Home Alone 3 I was curious how they could continue with the same story considering Kevin would ve been 17 by 1997 He could take care of himself right So what does the director decide to do He takes a child just as annoying and makes him sick The kid is like 6 years old and the mother leaves him alone in the house What kind of team of burgerlers are these idiots I don t really want to get too into detail if you want to sadly see this movie But please I d recommend that you d stay away from it It s not worth your precious time Go fold a piece of paper do chores balance a pencil on your nose or take a nap It s better to do then to watch Home Alone 3 br br 1 10
This is the worst brain damaged ultra cheap super stupid silly pointless piece of trash I ve ever seen an unbelievable garbage of instant cult status among fans of the bizarre If you think that Ed Wood s Plan 9 is bad well let me tell you looks like Citizen Kane compared to that one Special effects again Plan 9 is Star Wars Acting Thor Johnson is Al Pacino so it s beyond bad really But if you are looking for that kind of incredible movies it s for you I m a fan of American International for so many glorious horror movies the Price Corman Poe saga and some great blaxploitation stuff but with Star Creatures they descend right down to the Z level Of course my 1 out of 10 works in reverse if you like to watch bad movies for fun the guy playing an Indian chief is great so have fun and enjoy if you can
Some things need to be clarified The picture of Mark Ferris is not the Mark Ferris who starred in this movie I know that because he was my dad Please remove that picture Also Mark Ferris was the writer at least one of them I have been trying to find a copy or a way to see this movie again It has been years and if someone can point me in the direction of obtaining a copy that would be great The movie wasn t all that bad and trying to compare it to todays world of Star Wars and other high tech sci fi s it futile If you watch it just enjoy it for the rediculousness and humor it possesses Lighten up on being movie snobs and enjoy some less creative and innovated films
Invasion of the Star Creatures would definitely be in the so bad it s good category if the film wasn t quite so sexist or racist That it is such just makes it plain bad br br It has the same kind of hardline stereotypical sexism that you saw in Queen of Outer Space and the kind of racist stereotypes in this instance Native Americans that you would normally find in thirties forties b westerns In terms of being non funny the same walking through the cave gag is repeated well over ten times during the course of this fairly short movie Ray does do one good impression of Jimmy Cagney but can t make it work for two impressions of Cagney in a row nor handle a Peter Lorre when he tries it There really aren t any production values to speak of as the Star Creatures make the Ro Man from Robot Monster or Tor Johnson in Plan 9 from Outer Space look like creations of Industrial Light and Magic br br This film was definitely one of a vanguard of what you would have to call early independent cinema not artsy enough for those theaters and not good enough for anything but the last feature of an all night drive in br br
Let me start by saying that I understand that Invasion of the Star Creatures was meant to be a parody of the sci fi films of the 50s I understand that none of it is to be taken seriously The problem I have is that none of it works A parody should be funny and this one just isn t Not once during the entire runtime did I so much as crack a smile In general I am easily entertained but I couldn t find a sliver of entertainment anywhere in Invasion of the Star Creatures br br I knew I was in trouble right from the beginning The two stars make their screen appearance with one of the lamest gags imaginable a water hose they can t control that gets them both wet These two come off as Bowery Boys wannabes Why anyone would want to mime the act and persona of the Bowery Boys is beyond me After the less than illustrious beginning the movies goes on to feature comical chase sequences dancing Indians vegetable men decoder rings and other assorted unfunny bits It s all just a complete waste of time br br I bought this on the double feature DVD with Invasion of the Bee Girls That movie is Academy Award winning stuff in comparison with Invasion of the Star Creatures
Gloria Victor and Dolores Reed in space girl costumes br br I love 50 sci fi I even love cheesy 50s sci fi but this film is really really bad And not in a MST3K kinda way br br Virtually unwatchable as a couple of bozos do their best hip cat impression of Abott Costello br br Chessecake can usually save cheesy sci fi such as in Cat Women On The Moon but it can t in this case This film requires a mute button and fast forward feature br br That said I could watch Gloria and Dolores walk around the space ship for about an hour or so
This was one of those films that got a ton of play on the airwaves in the early 1970 s usually on the 4am Movie or one time on the 7 30 PM Channel 6 Big Movie and still another on Creature Double Feature WHen local channels used to run movies as part of their local programming mostly gone today in favor of infomercial time It was of the time A couple of low rent Abbott and Costello wannabees Frankie Ray and Robert Ball are in a platoon of soldiers half a dozen guys in Army Surplus remainders who are sent on field maneuvers to look into some strange radiation and wind up encountering extraterrestrials They first go into Bronson Canyon to what would be later the famous Batcave on BATMAN and encounter the remains of a dead carrot monster Later in the cave they re chased by a living carrot creature basically a guy in black suit and paper mache head with sparkly things on it and ping pong ball eyes Two of them complete geeks Ray and Ball are captured and wake up tied to tables and are being examined by space amazons Dr Poona nooo kidding and Professor Tanga who are stunningly beautiful and even moreso in their skimpy bikini uniforms We were too young at the time to realize what later bondage and fetish scenarios this examination scene would more than suggest Turns out that the two gals and their carrot monster are stranded on earth with a ship that s well hidden and are trying to return to their world br br The film was made as a total comedy with varying degrees of taste but remember this was of the time when Eric Von Zipper and his crew from Frankie and Annette s films were the height of B film drive in comedy So it only seemed a natural to jump on the bandwagon for some quick bucks br br For some reason I only thought I d imagined seeing this film to start with No I really saw it And when it was released on restored DVD I was assured in my memory The comedy goes from mildly funny to just plain stupid but whatever The budget is non existent which is a minor miracle when you think about it that it even got made and we can talk about a restored version here and now over 40 years later The payoff is the girls who want to learn about love and kissing and the upshot is the geeks which all of us were get the girls and love wins out It s just goofy and silly and for the locations has nostalgic significance
I appreciate a think positive feel good about yourself film but this is too much In the end they look like a bunch of loonies This film is one of those finding yourself 70 s plots I know the film is made in 1980 A lot more of Clint and girl friend movie This movie is a 3 10
Sondra Locke stinks in this film but then she was an awful actress anyway Unfortunately she drags everyone else including then real life boyfriend Clint Eastwood down the drain with her But what was Clint Eastwood thinking when he agreed to star in this one One read of the script should have told him that this one was going to be a real snorer It s an exceptionally weak story basically no story or plot at all Add in bored poor acting even from the normally good Eastwood There s absolutely no action except a couple arguments and as far as I was concerned this film ranks up at the top of the heap of natural sleep enhancers Wow Could a film BE any more boring I think watching paint dry or the grass grow might be more fun A real stinker Don t bother with this one
Clint Eastwood is Bronco Billy the leader of a Wild West troupe one of six regular misfits who comprise a struggling to break even touring show The seventh member of the bunch is a woman Billy s assistant but such women never last long and the position is chronically open Enter Antoinette Lilly Sandra Locke Eastwood s girlfriend at the time It seems Miss Lilly as Doc Scatman Crothers calls her is a would be heiress who will only receive her long deceased father s estate if she s married by the time she turns 30 so on the eve of that birthday she gets hitched to the cartoonish Geoffrey Lewis br br So what s the plot of this film It s hard to say There s the romantic tension between Billy and Miss Lilly but the problem is that for the first half of the movie she s so haughtily insipid and detestable that when she suddenly becomes one of the troupe halfway through the film it s not only unbelievable but the audience is well past caring about her There s the chronic lack of funds behind the Wild West show but this topic isn t touched upon enough to really be the raison d etre of the film There s Miss Lilly s predicament of being stranded in the rural west cut off from the funds that fuel her spoiled life of luxury she s mistakenly believed to be dead by her family and the press But are we really supposed to believe that she couldn t get back to New York and her waiting fortune if she gave it a bit of effort br br No the point of this film seems to be that Billy is the leader of a family a lovable bunch of losers who hang together through thick and thin This is a warm fuzzy film or at least tries to be br br Along the way Clint shows us his skills with a gun even foiling a bank robbery in a shooting that is grotesquely out of place in an otherwise relatively non violent film One of the gang is arrested on an old draft evasion charge Billy bribes the local sheriff The show s tent burns down an orphanage makes them a new one But numerous mundane pitfalls do not a plot make br br Compounding the problem is the acting or lack thereof Aside from Scatman Crothers the supporting cast is quite amateurish Eastwood isn t on top of his game either though he looks better simply by virtue of being surrounded by such a lackluster bunch br br And for all this the film plods on for 116 minutes To what point Good question br br 4 out of 10

Ten minutes worth of story stretched out into the better part of two hours When nothing of any significance had happened at the halfway point I should have left But ever hopeful I stayed And left with a feeling of guilt for having wasted the time Acting was OK but the story line is so transparent and weak The script is about as lame as it could get but again stretching out the ten minute plot doesn t leave a whole lot of room for good dialogue
This movie is hilarious not in good way The fights are awfully bad done while sometimes they will try to shock you by breaking some bones and even this happens only two or three times definitely not enough to call it a shockmovie A gunfight means a hero can walk into an open field with 10 people shooting at him with uzi s pick up a gun start shooting back and not get hurt br br The story empty guy waking up lost his memory starts fighting cos that s what he s good at Five years later memories come back takes revenge blablabla br br Not worth your buck not really worth your time unless you re drunk and bored
This movie is so bad that I cannot even begin to describe it What in the blazing pit is wrong with the writers producers and director How on earth did they get funding for this abomination The plot is laughable the acting is poor at best the story What story The first fight in this movie is OK but then it keeps repeating itself until you want to turn it off br br I guess I m the biggest looser for not turning this stupid movie off after the first minute br br SPOLER ALERT br br I only saw this movie because Scott Adkins was in it and he is in it for 30 seconds br br I give it 1 out of 10 because it s the lowest grade IMDb has to offer br br Do yourself a favour See an Uwe Boll movie instead twice it s more worthy of your time
I had always been a big Lynda Carter Wonder Woman fan so when the Sci Fi Channel ran this movie I had to see it I was bitterly disappointed This is a Wonder Woman movie in name only She doesn t wear the right costume she must have refused to or had ordered major changes and the plot runs like a poor man s James Bond There s none of the things that made the comic book heroine a success i e the superhuman strength or determined will It s just one long bad dream I don t even think Cathy is all that attractive anyway I wouldn t waste your time on this
I ve been reading posts here concerning Wonder Woman s costume for this TV movie It should be pointed out at the time the movie was made she wasn t wearing her traditional outfit The producers were actually sticking to the comic book writer s conception of WW for the early seventies br br As for the movie itself I have to agree with many of the other posters here Snoozefest I was a kid when it appeared on ABC in 1974 so I was at the right age to have appreciated a movie about a comic book hero Yet I was so engrossed with the plot I stopped watching it three quarters into the movie br br Of course I wasn t at the right age to appreciate Cathy Lee
I remember watching this on prime time when I was about 7 years old I was a huge comic book reader at the time and anything relating to superheroes was anticipated heavily The end result however was underwhelming br br I was aware of the Emma Peel Diana Prince stories as they had only recently come to an end and Diana was returned to her Amazonian form However there was so little action that I was bored throughout most of the movie The final costume was an interesting idea but looked more like a cheerleader than a superhero br br I saw the movie again in my late teen years It hadn t improved much Cathy Lee Crosby was more familiar thanks to That s Incredible but her acting was no better The script had a few good ideas like the rogue Amazon and a decent villain in Ricardo Montalban but it just didn t come together and was still boring br br I think they should have built the back story better and built the show into a more epic climax It was too much like a bland spy film crossed with a superhero story written by someone who had never seen a comic book The Amazon elements were intriguing but needed to be expanded br br The film did succeed in forcing producers to go back to the drawing board and come up with something more faithful if a bit too camp and low budget The budget was also pretty low here and superheroes don t come cheap br br It would be nice to have the movie available on DVD if only as a comparison and historical document Even Superman 4 is available and it has nothing over this film except Chris Reeve and Gene Hackman It s worth seeing for curiosity sake and for a bit of inspiration and caution for future versions
Apparently Shakespeare equals high brow which equals in turn a bunch of folks not seeing something for what it really is At one point in this film someone I believe Pacino s producer warns him that film is getting off track that it was once about how the masses think about Shakespeare through the vehicle of RICHARD III Instead he decides to shoot a chopped up play with random comments sprinkled throughout Some scenes seemed to be included as home movies for Al was there really ANY reason for the quick visit to Shakespeare s birthplace other than for a laugh about something unexpected which happens there and before the film has really even begun we are treated to seeing Al prance around and act cute and funny for the camera I thought his silly act with Kay near the end of GODFATHER III with the knife to his throat was AN ACT but apparently it s how Al really behaves in person br br Enough rambling Here s a shotgun smattering of why I didn t even make it 3 4 of the way through this 1 pretentious Al always knows when the camera is on him whether he s acting as Richard or in a real conversation with someone you can see it in the corner of his eyes also some of the actors around the rehearsal table become untethered and wax hammy to the extreme If anyone reading this has ever spent any time with an group of actors and has witnessed this kind of thing from the outside it s unbearable Look at me chewing all the scenery 2 Winona Ryder When she appears as Lady Anne this film comes to a screeching halt which it never recovers from She has nothing to add in the discussion scenes but the camera lingers on her to bring in the kiddoes Her performance is dreadful to boot 3 the only things you really learn from this are told to you by the very scholars the filmmakers are trying to keep out of the picture Of course you also learn that Pacino shouldn t be directing films or doing Richard in the first place I d rather watch BOBBY DEERFIELD than this br br Lastly read the play and learn it for yourself Go out and see it performed In 1997 I saw the play performed at the University of Washington Ethnic Cultural Theater and it made what we see in this film seem like high school drama except for the gratuitous throat slashing of Clarence My God Was that necessary br br It s all just a bunch of sound and fury signifying nada
It seems that Salvatores couldn t decide what to do with this movie some of it is a very weak thriller and I say very very weak some of it is an attempt to explore the relationships between the main characters Both things have been tried in psychological thrillers but in this case the movie cannot hold things together due to poor superficial scripting bad acting and a too dark too dull cinematography I d say that Salvatores gave his best in other genres and in other settings where he was free to look at the characters without having to think about the plot On the whole a B movie hardly worth your money Vote 4 10
This film s premise is so simple and obvious that only a Texas millionaire high on oil fumes and whiskey would have a problem understanding it if someone shouted it across the proverbial parking lot In summary the oil business is in cahoots with The Government or Gummint if you prefer the Gummint is in cahoots with Middle Eastern despots and the CIA is a singular festering pool of double dealing sons of insert word willing to toe any line that comes their way The only people that get done over are the good ones like Mr Clooney Bob Oh and terrorism is a result of the poverty which globalization creates when wicked multinationals stalk the world looking for a tasty takeover or three That really fits to the profiles of the well heeled 9 11 perpetrators br br In Syriana this facile tissue of political half truths and Hollywood holograms is stirred up in a repugnant vermicelli of story strands that twist turn and whirl through the gloopy circumlocutions of their own insignificance until the poor viewer is left alone with the conclusion that br br 1 the director good joke should never be let near a camera again br br 2 people like Clooney and Hurt might know how to act but they sure don t know how to pick a script br br 3 if you want to see a film that deals with corruption in big business and the state go and see Claude Chabrol s L ivresse du pouvoir which is insightful funny and brilliantly acted br br Empty doom laden sententious piffle spun out to evening ruining length
Considering how much money was budgeted for this film you would expect more from the story as a whole This could be quite possibly the most worthless movie I have ever watched There was no real advancement of anything Character development minimal Plot advancement maybe Enjoyment none I m not sure what points were even trying to be made If you want to see a movie where terrorists are kinda good guys American CIA bombs everything that doesn t agree with our opinions all capitalists are corrupt and you like to see anything resembling a storyboard advancement accompanied by a death have at For those of us who realize that it doesn t take killing off a good guy to make a point we ll stick to other movies In summary this was a horrible attempt at an Ocean s 11 style hide the plot so person has to think movie because not only do you not know what s going on nobody who made the movie did either Home Alone 3 was a better cinematic piece
We gave up at the point where George Clooney s character has his finger nails extracted We were not squeamish having sat through an hour of this drivel we just knew what it felt like To say this film was incomprehensible boring pretentious twaddle would be to over praise it How did people manage to sit through this confusing slow depressing pseud s corner of a film let alone nominate it for an Oscar Clooney looked as ill as we felt watching him What was he thinking Oh and what was with those subtitles did we just have a dud DVD or was the original film done like that sentences left hanging in mid air The film was hard enough to follow without that as well I pity the cast who obviously did their best with the material available
Contrary to most other comments about Syriana on the IMDb web site I and my family found watching this film on DVD at home a complete waste of time and space br br In short this was a film based on a script whose writer was being too clever by far Rather than trying to tell a complex story in an intelligent and clear manner it was assumed that constantly throwing mostly vague and hard to connect with each other 30 second vignettes of different story lines from a dozen or so story lines at the audience made for great and clear viewing No sir it does not What does make for great viewing is total clarity precision plots and story lines and characterisations which have a beginning a middle and an end br br This kind of cinematic presentation akin to the Dim Sum experience in a Chinese restaurant is pretentious and unintelligent in the extreme br br Thank goodness then for the TV and DVD presentations of the Hollywood and British film noirs of the 1940s and 1950s whose writers director and actors knew the value of clear story telling diction and acting that meant something br br This is one DVD that this family will not be sitting through again
I saw this film last night following a lot of good reviews from many sources I would like to point out that if your not ready to try and work out continuously who is who and what it all means you will hate this film br br I am still struggling to understand the roles of the actors in this film the film jumps from different stories and does not allow you to really empathise with any of the roles br br For the political buff s and those interested in corruption in other world governments out there this film is probably quite good but to the average movie watcher this film is awkward very boring in places and you will leave the cinema confused and annoyed that you paid the entrance fee br br see it if your ready to focus 100 on every minute detail or politics interest you don t see it if you actually like watching films
OK Hollywood is not liberal br br Obviously I m lieing because it is Im a conservative but the politics i will leave out of my opinion of the movie This movie was anti bush anti middle east anti big oil propaganda but that is not why it was bad br br Fist off i will give credit where credit is due i saw this film opening night because i happen to like these kinds of films and am a political science major in collage The cinematography was excellent and the acting was as far as i could tell very good br br The plot was impossible for me to decode however I have been tested and have an IQ of 138 but no matter how hard i tried there was no way i could piece together the story line of the movie and what characters where doing what br br The story and scene sequence was totally incoherent and poorly organized br br Unless this is one of those movies that is meant to be watch many times to get the full depth pf the story which it very well may be i have no idea exactly what was going on br br Which makes sense because if you want to make a political argument and not receive any criticism then make your argument impossible to critique If you cant dazzle them with brilliance then baffle them with Bull S
This movie supposedly a thriller had about five sub plots that developed simultaneously to climax at the end but it ended up more as a yawn br br The writing was trite the pace was slow and disjointed and the characters were boring George Clooney looks like he needs to get into a gym Matt Damon hammed it up and the others seemed to read their lines from a teleprompter br br The worst part of this movie was that it was carefully crafted to be politically correct and so it ended up saying nothing at all about big business oil and the Middle East I have seen documentaries provide more excitement Watch it only if there s absolutely nothing else to do
Exceedingly complicated and drab I m a bright guy but this was just too much for a tired brain It would really benefit from a few early clues as to who these people are and what they are doing Probably better for the US market GC himself hinted that this alone did not supply his Oscar and you can see why br br Still the sand dunes are pretty The nail pulling is nasty The attorneys drunk dad is a mystery The cricket is good to see br br Very difficult to write the required ten lines on this despite it being over 2 hours long Thank heavens they shortened it Admittedly we don t get to the pictures much but the last film we saw Walk the Line was 10 times better and I don t really like Johnny Cash My wife says George still looks good with the beard and a few extra pounds so there s that am I nearly there yet br br How about now
I couldn t wait to receive the DVD after hearing so much about the film What a disappointment This became one of the most confusing films I ve ever viewed There were so many characters introduced some resembling others that it became impossible to follow the story line I could not understand how George Clooney received an acting award for the film since he was hardly involved at least in the first half of the movie My wife and I gave up after about an hour of misery and stopped the DVD I might have considered fast forwarding to see if the ending was any better but after so much confusion decided that chances for improvement were slim A co worker told me that a lot of the movie comes together in the last minute or less I was glad I didn t waste another hour waiting I gave the DVD away the following day
This movie was slower then Molasses in January in Alaska The man who put togeather the preview should get an award for managing to put every one of the 30 seconds that were interisting into the preview I had to wake up the people I was watching it with several times After it was over I felt bad for having woken them up br br Most of the film is taken up with hoping something will actually happen but nothing ever does It was easy to loose track of people s motives and the characters were flat and uninteristing By the end of the movie you just hoped everyone would died Everyone runs around either being contemptible petty or pitiful and usually all three br br And worse we watched a minute or two of the added features just for kicks and giggles you understand and all that we saw was people being smug about how socially aware they are If they had spend the time on the movie that they did patting themselves on the back it might have been worth watching br br I was brought in expecting the excitement of 24 I got a lecture on social awareness through the blery eyes of the sandman
Simply put the movie is boring Cliché upon cliché is confirmed and story lines never come together It seems as if the director was unsure whether to make a movie or a documentary The main plot is very thin a CIA agent is ordered to kill an oil prince gets caught and then warns the prince why and therefore some elements were added to make the movie more interesting So a kid dies which results in the natural response of the father freely advising the person indirectly responsible for his son s death The lawyer has a drunk friend and keeps him around why no one knows Some kids become suicide terrorists and blow up a ship br br All in all this is one of the worst movies I have seen in quite a while I was neither entertained nor intellectually challenged I neither laughed nor cried I did not gain an understanding nor was I compelled to learn more or take up a cause It meant nothing to me which in my eyes is the worst one can say about a movie
Seldom do I give up on a movie without seeing the entire show This is particularly true when I have rented it on DVD Syriana was one in which I did give up Half way through I turned it off in bored disgust br br This movie is disjointed boring confusing and lackluster The acting was dry and without credible portrayals The general plot was good but developed in such an insipid and boring fashion that it failed to grasp my attention or interest The multiple sub plots often failed to connect to each other and seemed more like random stories than an actual connected plot Too bad such a serious subject and such great actors could create such a flop I cannot imagine this movie receiving any nominations much less an award
Syriana swept the critics upon release and everything seemed to be raving about it I suppose it s one of those films that is intensely intelligent so intelligent that I think you need to be well versed in the oil industry and a politically brilliant mind I don t consider myself unintelligent I ve been studying politics since my early teens and I enjoy an intelligent film but for the most part unless it s a documentary films are meant to be primarily entertaining as well as have a message Syriana tried to be strictly intelligent and it does turn some people away I would even go so far as to say that those who rave about it and insist it s a 10 10 are lying because they think they look better This film was the most confusing senseless mindless dribble I have seen in awhile Especially considering the critical acclaim the Oscar nods and the cast Screenplay writer Stephen Gaghan has disappointed me yet again His horribly written Havoc preceded this film and I think he s just trying way too hard I can t believe he was offered the opportunity to write the Da Vinci Code screenplay On top of that Gaghan directed the film which made it an absolute mess I had no idea who anyone was why things were happening who was who and what was what It was a disaster br br Because I don t really know who anyone was I can only mention the actors and what I thought of their performances because despite the horrendously complicated script the actors did alright George Clooney plays C I A field agent and assassin I think Bob Barnes Clooney has never been a favorite of mine but lately he s managed to churn out some decent performances and this seemed to be a pretty good performance on his part Barnes was a complex character with a sordid history and if I knew what was going on with him I would have really enjoyed his character Matt Damon plays Bryan Woodman and he is rather bland and always looks like a deer in the headlights which I can understand his confusion after reading this script and then trying to perform it Amanda Peet plays his wife and she does well in the few scenes she is given Christopher Plummer makes a cameo appearance as someone doing something I like Plummer and love seeing him show up even if he doesn t get top billing anymore br br The cast is intense if only the story made sense I d like to exact quote the description of plot on IMDb A missile disappears in Iran but the CIA has other problems the heir to an Emirate gives an oil contract to China cutting out a US company that promptly fires its immigrant workers and merges with a small firm that has landed a Kazakhstani oil contract The Department of Justice suspects bribery and the oil company s law firm finds a scapegoat The CIA also needs one when its plot to kill the Emir apparent fails Agent Bob Barnes the fall guy sorts out the double cross An American economist parlays the death of his son into a contract to advise the sheik the CIA wants dead The jobless Pakistanis join a fundamentalist group All roads start and end in the oil fields WHAT Say who now Syriana might be the thinking man s movie but it bored me to tears and no matter how hard I tried to stay with it I eventually surrendered and turned it off after an hour and a half and you couldn t have bribed me enough to get me to finish it I suppose if you want to form an opinion than by all means watch it but I promise you someone looking for entertainment or an enjoyable film will be asleep in the first half hour 1 10
Living in the Middle East in Israel I was excited when I bought my ticket for Syriana Having seen the trailer and being a thriller lover I expected to see first of all a fast moving breath catching movie which wisely dips in global policy making and the relation between oil power and corruption from a fresh angle Well I almost left the movie in the middle The pace was painfully slow almost all characters were stereotyped the intertwined editing made understanding the logic very difficult but as Steve Rhodes wrote in his review in the end you don t care Save your money save your time choose another movie br br Robi Chernitsky
Imagine turning the American national anthem into a cartoon Throw in a couple of cute animals some terrible puns and a pair of roller skates and you d find yourself with almost an exact replica of this film br br I remember seeing this when I was younger I made my Mother rent it from the video shop about 5 times The story itself isn t too bad it s just that any Marxists watching would certainly have something to complain about br br If you don t like America you won t like this film
This is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen everything about it is weak and incoherent The acting is absurd the costumes even crummier and the story is non existent This poverty row sword and adventure film was meant to capture some of the success that Beastmaster and Conan enjoyed but it doesn t give us any reason to follow along The lead character is tepid and dull he can t even fight with a sword and the sword is from the 16th Century All the action sequences are like that slow and unrealistic not to mention the castle and the horribly dated music playing whenever they are riding a horse Don t even bother with this crap
I saw the MST3K version of Deathstalker III and loved the movie so much even unmystied that I decided to watch the entire series of Deathstalker films I bought I and II and settled down for a laugh br br Nothing about Deathstalker I was funny on any level and when the credits rolled I was embarrassed and regretful that I had bought it Too much ugliness and nudity I guess either DS 3 was a much cleaner production or MST3K really edited a lot because I expected something similar i e stupid and carefree and simple I was wrong Even at 6 99 it seemed a waste of money I didn t even open DS 2 as I will return it tomorrow Now I ll probably just throw away this DVD as I can t return it and no one wants it including myself So really don t bother with this one Even the nudity lots of it btw is uninspiring and icky
I don t recall walking out of a movie theater except this once Not only that but I was with 7 friends and we all wanted to go An uninteresting plot characters made of clay violence with no point I didn t care when the good guys died I didn t care when the bad guys got it The fantasy and magic was laid on thick as liver pudding and there was no coherency In short fine entertainment if you happen to be spending an eternity in Hell
Wha BAM Someone surely had fun devouring a whole truckload of acid mushrooms and then subsequently scripting this crazy excuse for a motion picture Writer Howard Cohen expands the Sword Sorcery concept with a couple of extra S s like Sex Silliness more Sex and Sheer Stupidity This isn t just a movie this is every juvenile pervert s dreams fantasies come true Deathstalker has it all blood violence trolls female mud wrestling attempted rape successful rape life sized pigs awful hairstyles hideously oiled muscular bodies multi sexual orgies gay warriors tournaments to the death delirious witches dismemberment laughable villains and boobs boobs BOOOOOOOOOBIES Deathstalker literally wipes the floor with its obvious role model Conan The Barbarian when it comes to terms of cheesiness and sheer flamboyance The story is evidently of minor importance Lone and gay only he doesn t know it yet warrior Deathstalker goes on a mission as commanded by an annoying witch to gather the three notorious elements of creation or something like that On his journey he combines forces with a troll turned human a fighter who s even gayer than he is and last but not least a luscious lady who doesn t really seem to be a big support of the concept of bras Together they head for the kingdom of the ultimately evil Munkar where they ll participate in a warriors tournament and conquer no less than two out of three elements Munkar is bald guy with half a spider s web tattooed on his skull and an impressive harem that would even make the wealthiest oil sheik jealous Okay granted Deathstalker is a pretty damn awful and at some times even unendurable movie The fight sequences are lame and the costumes and make up effects are downright pitiable For a moment when beholding the opening sequence I actually feared I was watching Troll the Prequel The monsters look incredibly cheesy and the complete opposite as menacing but it s undeniable entertainment if you re in an undemanding mood I presume this isn t a favorite amongst feminists as the overall portrayal of women is somewhat um discriminating Most of the gals exclusively serve as eye candy in the harem They re allowed crawl over the floor naked and play around in the mud but strictly forbidden to open their mouths The two leading ladies Barbi Benton and Lana Clarkson are ravishing but in all honesty if it wouldn t be for their continuously exposed racks they would hardly be worth mentioning either
This is one of those movies that you and a bunch of friends sit around drinking beers eating pizza and laugh at Unfortunately for me I found myself watching this one alone My friends and I rented a big block of movies and never got around to seeing this one It was due back and I figured that it was a waste not to watch it So I did and I was impressed at how absolutely terrible this movie is br br Now I love bad movies quite a bit and I probably would have liked this one if the hero wasn t so utterly loathsome The entire movie I was hoping that he d put that stupid sword down and let someone kill him He does very little heroic things in the movie He s a beefy disgusting stupid thing He has less redeeming qualities than the villains do And what was it with all the naked chicks I mean I love naked chicks just as much as the next guy but this movie went a tad overboard in that department br br Well anyway if you love bad movies and can stand a disgusting hero then I m sure you ll like this schlock of a film
I had to give this film a 1 because it s that bad but don t make this think that I didn t enjoy watching because I laughed and laughed and I even had a few questions So half of the time I was laughing half of the time I was saying what in the hell is going on or why would someone do this et cetera I mostly enjoyed the terrible fog effects the 80 s style nude scene battle dialogue nude scene and the way that the warrior s swords flap in the wind when they ride their horses And there s some crappy model effects those aren t supposed to be real trees are they and I still don t understand this guy that they find in the cave what in the hell is he A friend of mine told me about these movies and I thought I would give em a try and I basically liked the film as people like Ed Wood films I have no real enjoyment of what the film was meant to be I look at it in my own hilarious way So don t let this distract you if you really thought this was an action movie it is I just liked it for other reasons It s much much worse than Evil Dead so it can actually make you think as though you are wasting your life by watching it which came into my mind a few times I guess the best thing for most people would be to have a few drinks have some friends around and laugh at this film Maybe this is a bit harsh but I don t think so rent it and you ll see Yo
DEATHSTALKER is perfect for B fantasy movie fans this barely 80 minute travesty of film making features everything hecklers can ask for non existent plotting terrible acting save for at least a raspy sounding old lady laughable scripting and schlock editing and bargain basement style background settings There are no characters that come across as likable or interesting in particular the lead doesn t have ANYTHING appealing about him and the actors assembled barely do anything to rise above the F grade material If that s not enough then how about the lack of a compelling plot which this movie has nothing of the sort to make DEATHSTALKER qualify as a major turkey I was also offended that the women in this movie barely serve any purpose other than to 1 be topless and or scantily clad 2 get raped 3 have sex with the hero 4 all of the above In addition the background music is hideous a bizarre mess of electronic noise cheesy choral bursts and blaring orchestral cacophony Ear numbing and eye numbing all in one packed with nary a thing to keep one interested DEATHSTALKER is probably best suited for folks looking for something to laugh at and believe me there s plenty of that in here Otherwise I do not recommend this 100th grade CONAN wanna be to anyone in the least
Or more precisely so bad that you are going to have the time of your life laughing your ass off when you watch it James Sbardellati s Deathstalker of 1983 is certainly one of the most awful productions the Sword Sorcery sub genre has brought along but it is highly amusing The acting is terrible the plot is pure crap and the effects and photography couldn t be more amateurish But it is the bad acting the cheesy effects and the many errors that makes this movie so hilarious br br SPOILERS AHEAD br br Deathstalker Rick Hill is an extremely strong and skilled warrior One day a good witch tasks him to unite the three powers of chaos and creation a sword an amulet and a chalice in order to free the country from its brutal ruler the evil king and sorcerer Munkar Obtaining the sword is quite easy but the amulet and the chalice are in Munkar s possession Fortunately the evil king has arranged a tournament in which the county s most skilled warriors fight each other until death The winner is then to take the king s place Of course the king doesn t want anybody to take his place an therefore he has planned to kill the winner instead of just not arranging the tournament in the first place Deathstalker is not only to obtain the the three powers of creation but also to save the old good king s gorgeous daughter Barbi Benton from the claws of evil Munkar Luckily he doesn t get bored on his way to the tournament since he is allowed hump the gorgeous female warrior Kaira Lana Clarkson in the meantime br br The film has many great incredibly stupid and funny scenes Some of my favorite scenes include br br Deathstalker beheads a bad guy with his sword The head that falls down however is not that guy s head The falling head has a red goatee while the guy beheaded by Deathstalker had dark hair and no beard br br When the character of female warrior Kaira Lana Clarkson is introduced she is first seen in a black robe hiding her face and body Deathstalker s traveling companion Oghris Richard Brooker fights her and during the sword fight her robe under which she is of course topless opens exposing her breasts Her breasts are the first thing we see of Lana Clarkson even before her face br br The last warrior Deathstalker has to fight in the tournament is a giant guy with the body of a man and the head of a pig br br Evil Munkar has an ugly little creature locked in a chest He feeds that little creature human eyeballs and fingers br br There are many other unintentionally funny hilarious and great scenes The acting is terrible but Barbi Benton and the late Lana Clarkson are eye candy and although I described this movie as unintentionally funny I sometimes had the impression that some of the actors were absolutely aware of how crappy the movie is There is a fair amount of gore and lots of female nudity to keep the viewer entertained Deathstalker is an incredibly awful movie but I still highly recommend it People with a sense of humor will have the time of their lives
This sword sorcery story of an appallingly brutal and callous hero vanquishing an evil king is worthless in almost every detail The acting is horrible from the leads to the supporting roles The leering gloating glee with which the director shows the hero smearing blood around is absolutely disgusting nor is it redeemed by any justice to his cause since he is as bad as the people he s fighting Z movie editing is abundant including a scene where a character dies from a sword thrust that very obviously missed completely br br The movie is clearly banking on the charms of the female leads Barbi Benton and Lana Clarkson who are paraded around mostly naked throughout the movie As a 20 something male I will not pretend that female flesh on the screen doesn t attract me But the treatment of their characters is so degrading and the sex scenes so casual and joyless that I couldn t enjoy even this aspect of the movie br br Most cheesy movies of this era are at least somewhat redeemed by a light hearted tongue in cheek feel the sequel is better in this regard but DEATHSTALKER seems to take itself completely seriously as heroic fantasy No way Avoid at all costs br br Rating 1 2 out of
Deathstalker is directed by John Watson and it stars Rick Hill who is some kind of body builder and famous of that if I have understood right The plot follows as Deathstalker Hill tries to get something back from the evil lord and he has to travel to the lord s cave He meets many dwarfs and monsters during his journey and the settings are very close to Tolkien and of course Conan the Barbarian This is a rip off of huge success of Conan and even though this is very stupid film it has many nice trash merits and is recommended for trash fans and tolerating film junkies br br There are no many cinematic merits in this film Couple of scenes are almost atmospheric and fascinating but what Deathstalker concentrates to show are nude females and huge muscles of Hill Females are usually helpless victims and very stupid too so this is very macho film and thus may not please many feminists The fight scenes are nothing special and pretty dull and the monsters are not either anything special And all the other aspects of the film are also very amateurish and badly done but what did you expect from low budget effort like this This tries to be as great as Conan but fails pretty miserably As I said this can please fans of turkey cinema but no one else This belongs to the category it s so bad it s great br br Deathstalker is still not as near as bad as it could be and as a turkey film I appreciate this almost as much as other turkeys enjoyable ones of course If bad films are your cup of tea then try this and have fun but if you don t understand enjoyably bad films then stay away And if somebody can t stand large amount of nudity then stay away as well There is more nudity here than violence and due to these scenes the film has an R rating Otherwise this could be some safe PG family film br br 4 10
This film s kind of like Conan the Barabarian but with more sex rape and murder There is a plot somewhere underneath all this debauchery but the filmmakers don t do a good job showing it which is a shame because it could be a decent story Richard Hill gives a solid performance in the lead role as does the villain who sadly didn t appear in anything else of note The fight scenes aren t too bad either I love the way Deathstalker lets his sword drink the blood of his victims and there s plenty of nudity and sex to temper the general level of machismo throughout br br All in all not good but not necessarily that bad either
Woosh Man What can I say br br The opening scene maybe We see a bunch of mongoloid barbarians with bad make up jump off the walls of some ruins They sneak around and attack some dude with a scantily clothed captive girl The dude runs off the mongoloids follow him and one of them stays behind seemingly to rape the girl but instead he exposes one of her breasts and kidnaps her Then the dude still on the run sees a horse and tries to steal it Suddenly a blond god like looking hero with a bad wig appears saying That s my horse The Mighty Deathstalker just made his appearance The mongoloids arrive Deathstalker kills all of them including the dude on the tunes of some rather inappropriate Mexicanos western score this is supposed to be a Swords Sorcery flick so what s with the arriba trompettos and then goes up to Captive Girl and exposes both her breasts He starts to rub them and Captive Girl seems to like it She starts liking her lips and caressing Deathstalker Just when they are about to get down to it this old dude appears interrupting what could have been the end of a perfect day for Deathstalker and a possible perfect ending for a short film br br Now tell me Isn t that the point where either a feminist would angrily switch off the movie or any other male viewer would say This is going to be one hell of a good movie The plot is as simple as throwing a kitten from the balcony Deathstalker must obtain the Sword of Justice and use it to steal the Amulet of Life and the Chalice of Magic from the evil sorcerer Munkar br br Aside from decapitations dismemberment random bloodshed retarded fist fights and embarrassing sword fights this film also contains a massive amount of t ts a shots I initially wanted to add one extra point to this movie for each gratuitous shot of naked boobies I could count After 9 points not even halfway into the movie I had to give up counting It was distracting me from the rest of the movie And the rest of the movie was worth it Totally crazy stuff Check out this mutant cat worm like creature Munkar has as a pet and which he feeds eyeballs and fingers And here s an interesting question What would you do if a man in a woman s body would enter your bedroom and try to kill you with a knife The answer is simple You slap him around a bit take away the knife and then try to rape him Then you discover that he s actually not a woman so you throw him out of your bed and tell him to leave your room It works out well I tell you Deathstalker does it too and the Deathstalker way is the right way br br DEATHSTALKER is a wonderful movie really as pointed out in other comments The villains are vile The women are delicious There s blood sex violence rape and tasty chicken There s a completely pointless tournament which just features a bunch of barbarians beating slashing and hacking the crap out of each other My favorite weapon used in that tournament was a giant wooden hammer used to beat a poor contender to bloody pulp And my favorite contender undoubtedly was that one brute with the Warthog head reminiscent of the Gamorrean Guards from RETURN OF THE JEDI I won t reveal how the movie ends but just prepare to ravish in delight when I tell you a 4 way dismemberment is thrown into the movie s climax br br And of course there s a wonderful display of ineptitude throughout the whole movie See a guy being dragged behind a horse over a dirt road and the next point of view shot shows him being dragged over grass no road See that awesome tattoo on the sorcerer s head magically change sides within the same scene on shot has it on the left side of his head the other on the right Well after all Munkar is a magician It s that or this movie was shot in an alternate universe where things like continuity simply don t exist br br As much as I enjoyed this and as much as I am looking forward to the other 3 installments in this series I do have enough shreds of decency left in me to not let this movie pass I am prepared though to give it the maximum amount of minimal points just so I could be able to deduct a couple of more points for the possibly inferior sequels to follow DEATHSTALKER might be a superbly fun trashy sleazy CONAN rip off it also is an abominable movie
Bette Davis brings her full trunk of tics to this miserable flop which is another variation on the hilariously mismatched lovers theme Sadly Cagney and Davis are truly mismatched in acting styles and the mix is not simply unpalatable but distasteful The only distinction in the film comes from Eugene Pallette who literally phones in his usual part as the deb s misunderstood dad Jack Carson s performance can only be described as an act of mayhem on the audience
Rich ditzy Joan Winfield a woefully miscast Bette Davis is engaged to be married to stupid egotistical Allen Brice Jack Carson looking lost Her father Eugene Palette is determined to stop the marriage and has her kidnapped by pilot Steve Collins James Cagney Seriously They crash land in the desert and hate each other but sigh start falling in love br br This seems to be getting a high rating from reviewers here only because Cagney and Davis are in it They were both brilliant actors but they were known for dramas NOT comedy and this movie shows why The script is just horrible there s not one genuine laugh in the entire movie The running joke in this has Cagney and Davis falling rump first in a cactus this is done THREE TIMES Only their considerable talents save them from being completely humiliated As it is they both do their best with the lousy material Cagney tries his best with his lines and Davis screeches every line full force but it doesn t work Carson has this what the hell look on his face throughout the entire movie probably because his characters emotions change in seconds Only Palette with his distinctive voice and over the top readings manges to elicit a few smiles But all in all this was dull and laughless a real chore to sit through This gets two stars only for Cagney and Davis acting and some beautiful cinematography but really it s not worth seeing Cagney and Davis hated this film in later years and you can see why
This film was a big disappointment br br I take the opposite view of the critics This is not a case of the material not being up to the level of the actors here the actors Bette Davis and James Cagney are simply not up to the level of the material Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert were every bit as big as Davis and Cagney and look how It Happened One Night turned out an all time classic With a very similar story Davis proves that she has no talent for comedy good thing for her that this is just about the only comedy she ever attempted Davis one note performance oozes petulance but none of the nuances of Colbert s acting in It Happened One Night Cagney who was a great comedy actor just seems out of sync with his costar Davis The script provides some decent lines and gags but the delivery seems better suited to drama than comedy br br Part of the problem is the soundtrack which like the delivery of Davis and Cagney seems more suitable to a light drama than a comedy br br Jack Carson who played similar roles throughout his career has more capably handled very similar material In a fairly typical supporting role Eugene Palette delivers a respectable performance In a slightly different role as an old west relic Harry Davenport is very good But in one of his poorest performances William Frawley is quite irritating His character s constant references to fictional cops are a poor effort at irony br br I really love every one of these performers and it is a shame that as an ensemble they achieve no more chemistry and no better result than The Bride Came C O D
0 5 10 This movie has absolutely nothing good about it The acting is among the worst I have ever seen what is really amazing is that EVERYONE is awful not just a few here and there everyone The direction is a joke the low budget is hopelessly evident the score is awful I wouldn t say the movie was edited brutally chopped would be a more appropriate phrase It combines serial killings voodoo and tarot cards Dumb Dumb Dumb It is not scary at all the special effects are hopelessly lame laughably bad throughout The writing was appallingly bad The cinematography is real cheap looking and very grainy sometimes and the camera work is dreadful Again what really does the movie in is how badly all the actors are Cheesy
I was searching through Hollywood video last night with a friend trying to find a good looking horror movie to watch over the New Year s weekend As I was looking through the shelves Severed spotted my eye and I grabbed it off the shelf and it looked like it might be a decent B grade horror movie The cover looked fairly good The plot sounded semi interesting So I rented it What a mistake Don t be fooled by the cover which actually looks decent I m thinking that more money was spent on the cover artwork than the movie itself The film follows two police detectives who are tracking down a voodoo inspired ritualistic serial killer called The Head Hunter who is decapitating victims left and right in some unnamed city probably Los Angeles and they become drawn into his world of ritualized murder br br Story sound somewhat good Well it is and this movie could ve been halfway decent But good God it was bad Almost everything about it was laughable The opening scene features some redheaded actress in a car trying to talk on this huge outdated cell phone and for whatever reason she goes outside and talks to some guy Then a shadow comes up behind them hacks off his head and the girl drops to the ground and starts crawling for absolutely no reason while trying to dial 911 Sound ridiculous Yep you bet it is The entire movie looks like it was filmed on a VHS quality camera and I m assuming it was The acting was mostly awful and the special effects were far from believable And the scenes with the policemen on the phone were awful the voice on the other line was echoing and it sounded like it was being recorded in someone s bathroom Everything about this movie was simply amateurish and tedious and it didn t hold my interest for very long and I often found myself bored and tired mostly because of the bad acting and the horrible cinematography The pacing was bad Everything was just bad br br Overall Severed is a failed attempt at what could have been a decent B movie The plot was good and I think if this film had been handled better and had a higher budget it could ve been alright But this movie fell flat on it s face If you re expecting something semi decent you ll be sorely disappointed Only recommended if you can tolerate D grade horror flicks Otherwise you ll probably want to stay away from this straight to video garbage It had a little potential but it was beyond a mess 1 10
I own this movie I bought it for 3 99 at a fairly major video retailer in order to do some indie type movie research since I had just finished my own feature and was editing it Now when I feel down about my skills as a first time director I just sit down with a plate of cookies and Severed Within minutes I feel great br br I hate to down talk another filmmaker so I ll just use constructive criticism 1 Find good actors Take the time It really helps 2 When shooting video over light your scenes and darken in the computer later on in post 3 Closeups are better for Video 4 When an actor enters a scene wait a bit before br br having them speak so that we know what s going on and who s talking 5 Never show the back of a door while we wait for someone to come open it Damn well worth the 3 99 br br The True Horror would be getting the reviews Severed has here on IMDb And you have to give these guys credit they did get distributed
Hm While an enjoyable movie to poke plot holes point out atrocious acting primitive at best special effects all of which have caused me to view this movie three times over the past six years Severed ranks among the worst I ve ever seen I m never sure who the protagonists are all I know is that the killer uses a portable guillotine as seen in the dance floor murder scene All in all I don t really like the movie because only the first 30 minutes are enjoyable the rest is a mishmash of confusing dialog and imagery that fail to progress the story to a logical conclusion which I can t remember anyway
This is one of them movies that has a awesome video box but has wired camra work and unknown actors that speak with bad dialogue Its so dark when the killings happen you can hardly see it plus the movie is hard to understand The only star in this is WCW s Vanessa Sanchez Tygres in WCW before it folded and she is a good actress I like low budget film especialy ones that has errors because they are fun to watch but Severed unfourtunatly isn t one of them This movie is ok to see if you like voodoo and severed heads but this is no blockbuster but if you need something new to watch then rent Severed
Bad acting bad lighting bad plot This had the quality of a porno movie I have seen more interesting home video of a boring wedding than this movie it sucked big time Don t waste your time or money on this crap It s amazing that they allow this kind of smut to even be released on video it should be a crime
There was nothing about this movie that I liked It was so obviously low budget with bad lighting and camera work almost like Blair Witch Project only it wasn t supposed to be that way There wasn t really much to the plot and the movie just drug on and on I actually fast forwarded through the last 1 3 of the movies but that did not help matters much It looked like it might be good from the box but I must say again nothing about this movie even resembled good No good actors the special effects were so fake the camera work was horrible and the dialogue was painfully terrible On my own personal scale I give this movie a 0 of 10 Yikes
OK I love bad horror I especially love horror bad enough to make fun of Demonicus or House of the Dead those were bad enough to make fun of Severed was not br br It was worse br br spoilers who cares br br My friend and I sat through the entire film and I have a number of comments both in the this sucks style and in the realm of actual critiques br br Plot sort of There s a guy in this city which is possibly Seattle see comment below who is running around and cutting off heads He s been doing this for over a year I m not going back to get exact numbers thank you VERY much possibly two or three years One head a week And the police are JUST NOW calling in a specialist who ONCE refers to himself as a psychic but that never comes up again br br Schya right Feds take over after what THREE connected homicides After NEARLY A HUNDRED SIMILAR KILLINGS we d be under freaking martial law br br Anyway this specialist consults the voodoo chick who the police have been ignoring the entire time and the two of them come to the conclusion that it s Baron Samedi a voodoo spirit who is cutting off heads to gain enough power to make himself a body and then presumably take over the world or possibly just go to Disneyland br br Um br br Setting where IS this happening Well if you re not from Seattle you might not realize that at the bar rave occupied by about ten of the movie staff and their family members there s a poster for a local radio station and that in the highly entertaining Pulp Fiction esqe dialog as IF between the two cops yes the ones who get their heads cut off about 15 minutes into the flick they discuss the new stadium which may still have been an issue when this movie was made br br Being from Seattle I apologize on the movie s behalf and hang my head in shame br br OK here s where it gets really critical being a horror movie writer not published don t go looking for my name in the IMDb I do research Lots of research And unlike the writers of this movie I know that Baron Samedi while a Voudon Loa spirit who guards the graveyards and has traditionally been associated by various Christian oppressors with Satan is actually a Loki like trickster god br br In other words he doesn t cut off heads br br Besides a major part of the Voudoun religion is that Baron Samedi can have a body whenever he wants Their religious ceremonies center around the possession of various members of the congregation by the loa br br Not to mention if he s already possessed someone why make a NEW body br br Also if Baron Samedi GOT a body he wouldn t go around cutting off heads he d get some good rum and cigars and par TAY br br In summary the only thing they did get surprisingly right is that in the completely unnecessary Tarot card reading used only to show that the voodoo chick is spooky they didn t screw up the interpretations of the cards the way most movies do Again I ve done research Anyone remember the old late night ad for phone in tarot readings The lovers you will soon fall madly in love and all that nonsense br br If you made it this far through my comments I congratulate you And I m sorry again I ll be more sorry if you feel the need to watch the film on account of me so please don t
To be brutally honest I LOVED watching Severed That s why I br br gave it a 1 10 stars because of its starkly unimaginative br br story filming acting everything This film was a RIOT to watch If br br you enjoy watching bad films in order to poke fun at them you will br br really get a kick out of Severed br br The story really doesn t matter it involves some guy who s bald br br and has a sword and goes around beheading random people br br But he has a supernatural twist nobody ever sees him do it br br Even when in one very memorable scene he walks into a br br jampacked night club and whacks off some girl s noodle and br br nobody sees it br br Severed doesn t merely look like it was filmed on video it WAS br br filmed on someone s home camcorder The filmmakers had br br knowledge of lighting very thin knowledge and composition br br actually holds together in some scenes But mostly you can t hear br br the actors you can t understand what they re doing and you laugh br br when the next vicitm gets his pumpkin detatched from his body br br Go and rent this movie Support films like this they are a hoot and br br a hollar
I m sure that the folks on the Texas Louisiana border must have had a a good laugh or two when Paramount s B picture unit inflicted this one on the war time public Very simply the area along the Sabine River where the film opens is cotton country just like the rest of the Deep South or at least the Deep South was post Civl War No big cattle empires there they re much farther west in Texas farther than Richard Dix and Preston Foster could ride to set up their empire br br The film begins with the two of them partners in a riverboat and when Leo Carrillo tries a theft of their services by not paying them for hauling his cattle they keep the cattle And that s the beginning of the big Ponderosa like ranch they start br br Along the way Foster marries Dix s sister played by Frances Gifford and feuds with his much smaller neighbors They also have some further run ins with Leo Carrillo br br Anyway us easterners who like westerns usually don t bother with geographical trifles and it s still a good western from the production mill of Harry Sherman who produced all those Hopalong Cassidy westerns for Paramount The climax is a blazing and I mean that literally gun battle that should have maybe been used on an A production br br But I wouldn t have any but western fans look at it
This film has the kernel of a really good story The work of the men and women of the Coast Guard especially in the North Pacific is the stuff of heroes and legends This film mucks up a good story with three endings none satisfying a couple of unneeded and pointless bar fights and two alleged romantic relationships that have as much spark as dead campfire The rescue scenes are great even if the computer generation is hokey and the scenarios are pretty unreal but the backstory is lame and disappointing Costner is good especially his hand acting watch for it Ashton Kutcher is flat but not terrible The main female characters are one dimensional The best female is one of the Coast Guard sailors in the rescue center and she s on camera for about two minutes in the whole film It could have been an excellent film and Costner needs one
I went to the movie as a Sneak Preview in Austria So didn t have an idea what I am going to see The story is very normal The movie is very long I believe it could have cut to 1 2 without causing any problems to the story Its the type of movie you can see in a boring night which you want to get bored more Ashton Kutcher was very good Kevin Costner is OK The movie is speaking about the US Coast Guards how they are trained their life style and the problems they face As there aren t much effects in the movie So if you want to watch it then no need to waste your money and time going to the Cinema Would be more effective to watch it at home when it gets on DVDs
