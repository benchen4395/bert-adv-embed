Simply put this is the best movie to come out of Michigan since well ever Evil Dead eat your heart out Hatred of A Minute was some of the oddest and best cinema to be seen by this reviewer in a long time I recommend this movie to anyone who is in need of a head trip or a good case of the willies
Hatred of a Minute is a hauntingly beautiful film A psychological thriller that takes you on a journey through the nightmare that is the life of a serial killer Eric Seaver Strong performances and excellent cinematography make this film a must see for any film student or horror fan The realness of the story and the human side of Eric separate this film from other psycho killer movies Some shout outs to the film s producer Bruce Campbell as well as to the film The Evil Dead add some humor for anyone that knows the genre
Michael Kallio gives a strong and convincing performance as Eric Seaver a troubled young man who was horribly mistreated as a little boy by his monstrous abusive alcoholic stepfather Barry a genuinely frightening portrayal by Gunnar Hansen Eric has a compassionate fianc√© sweetly played by the lovely Tracee Newberry and a job transcribing autopsy reports at a local morgue Haunted by his bleak past egged on by the bald beaming Jack the demon a truly creepy Michael Robert Brandon and sent over the edge by the recent death of his mother Eric goes off the deep end and embarks on a brutal killing spree Capably directed by Kallio who also wrote the tight astute script with uniformly fine acting by a sound no name cast Jeff Steiger is especially good as Eric s wannabe helpful guardian angel Michael rather rough but overall polished cinematography by George Lieber believable true to life characters jolting outbursts of raw shocking and unflinchingly ferocious violence a moody spooky score by Dan Kolton an uncompromisingly downbeat ending grungy Detroit Michigan locations a grimly serious tone and a taut gripping narrative that stays on a steady track throughout this extremely potent and gritty psychological horror thriller makes for often absorbing and disturbing viewing A real sleeper
I thought I should qualify my position after reading other reviews The movie is not great but it has a lot of great elements The lighting and scenes along with the camera work are great The story is slow and weak but entertaining The acting is bad but no worse than you will find on the SyFy Channel The music is pretty good and the gore is good It has the great Leather Face in the film and is produced by Bruce Campbell I watched the complete movie and while mostly predictable it was still enjoyable The women are attractive enough and the lead actor does a good job of being brooding and creepy The movie was remarkably clean for a modern film and the violence appropriate for children 13 and up There was no sex scenes I gave it 7 out of 10 and I think that is fair I would watch it again if I had nothing better to do The gay sounding angel was the most annoying aspect of the film the devil is quite creepy
Hatred of a Minute is arguably one of the better films to come out of Michigan in recent years Not to say that it s a brilliant film by any means but it s definitely worth a watch br br Hatred chronicles the sordid adventures of Eric Seaver played by director Kallio a formerly abused child now grown up and starting to listen to his evil side br br Hatred is very nice visually The shots are creative and the lighting is approporiately moody and interesting to look at This film actually has an element of production value to it unlike other recent Michigan releases like Dark Tomorrow and Biker Zombies Subtle dolly shots and stylized shot composition show good use of this film s 350 000 budget br br However Hatred stumbles in the same places that so many other local films do and that s in the story and character department Essentially things just kind of happen Eric Seaver doesn t evolve at all Basically he s always been crazy it s just that people are starting to notice The film just wanders along its merry way with very little development Also the ending is very abrupt br br However since this is a horror film since when do we care about plot We just want to see people die and Hatred certainly delivers As the body count mounted people in the theater started cheering Kill her Kill em all When people scream back at the screen it s always fun br br That s the place where Hatred succeeds It s fun And in the end that s all that really matters
This is a decent little flick made in Michigan about a guy that is haunted by his past with his abusive stepfather Gunnar Hansen and has grown up not so well adjusted In fact he s absolutely bonkers but tries not to be too obvious He s got an entourage too his own little demon angel that follow him around The demon never says a word but really doesn t have to and he s Max Schreck creepy Let s just say that the angel pretty much spins his wheels in this as Eric is busy doing things that make him feel better like freeing people that he decides need it mostly beautiful young women This is a decent portrayal of madness and you re kind of on your own at some point to figure out some of what s going on but overall I watched this from start to finish very focused on the film because it definitely held my interest It s a little lacking in some areas but nothing I can really lay my finger on A decent effort and worth seeing IF you like serial killer flicks
So what constitutes a real independent film In a day and age where the latest fad of mainstream hollywood is to appear rugged and cutting edge I m sorry to say that what the general public tends to perceive as independent film is usually nothing more than a clever marketing ploy br br Which is why we should be glad that films like Hatred of a Minute exist Across the board this film makes a point out of contradicting its own template indie horror film Love it or hate it Hatred isn t afraid of being what it is and in watching this film you get the real sense that Kallio the director didn t just make this film to spray fake blood all over the place he s in this to tell stories Good ones You may find this film in the horror film section of your video store but don t be fooled this story is also about love about good people pushed over the edge and that oh so distant light at the end of the tunnel br br If you expect smut or an Evil Dead ripoff stay away from this film But if you dig the finer points of the horror suspense genres check this film out br br Yes Bruce Campbell did produce this movie and I m sure he s proud to tell anyone that it s not Evil Dead Bruce has never tried to bank on his ash image and it s obvious that he didn t get involved with Hatred so that it could do so either br br My advice though to all Dead ites rabidly devouring anything issued by Mr Campbell is to check this film out anyway and see what else Mr Kallio and Mr Campbell are trying to show you br br The acting is well done although nothing about this film is oscar caliber perhaps intentionally it s good to see compassionate performances in a horror film So often actors in films such as these don t even seem to try with Hatred it seemed as though all the actors took thier charecters very seriously never resorting to typical horror film campiness br br Technically Hatred is about as competent as indie film gets The editing is fast paced the cinematography is good given the budget and Hatred keeps a quick pace without any bog down points or bad anti climaxes br br All in all Hatred may not have the glossed over look of all those multi million dollar fake indies but personally I don t see a problem with that It s a film by folks who actually care about the medium People who reached into thier broke ass pockets pulled out thier nickles and dimes threw caution to the wind and made a damn good movie br br Check this one out
despite the occasionally stilted acting and seen it all before story this is a fairly compelling movie br br It has suspense the scenes with the demon are actually pretty creepy some of the visual effects are superb and best of all no ridiculously ill placed humour to detract from the film as too many wannabe horror films have in them now br br honestly this isn t the greatest film ever made but it actually draws you in and at least makes an attempt at character development br br i was glad i watched it
Michigan Edgar Allen Poe a toaster and a frying pan If you don t mind the psycho thriller or horror film genre and you have a special place in your heart for the twisted this is the movie for you An amazingly well developed first film Hatred of a Minute has all the draw of mainstream hits like Silence of the Lambs and of cult classics like Army of Darkness The editing and effects are well done better than many films in the genre Kallio weaves an intricate tale of torment drawing on both the Bible and Poe s writings At a time when big budget big name films lack much in the way of substance the independent film has resurrected this dying trait If you love Michigan a good story or a decent thriller go check out Hatred of a Minute
I think it unfortunate that the leading comments on this movie include the words Clueless and appalling nonsense I think it is a very funny movie and excellent entertainment One has to suspend one s disbelief that a homosexual man and a lesbian woman could fall in love have a child and live together happily ever after But it is always wonderful to see it played out in a movie and have one s heart warmed Is it so impossible There are far more implausible events described in other movies The acting is good the script is funny The only negative comment is that the story could well have ended when the family drives away from its initial house instead of extending on to explore whether the man retains any residual homosexuality
This film was seen by my wife and I when it came out in 1978 It was a revelation to us We actually thought that we were the only gay and lesbian couple who had ever married and had children Obviously we were wrong Love may come from where you don t expect it and maybe don t want it But we both chose that love anyway br br And no it never changed our sexual orientation That kind of stuff is for the Christian wackos br br When we were young we both had affairs but never with the opposite sex As we aged we stopped having extramarital affairs br br This story is not far fetched However the suggestion that they became heterosexuals seems pretty unrealistic to me My wife and I have been sleeping together for the last 40 years We are still gay End of story
This is a film for entertainment I did not think the world made social commentary from one small film I personally find this film funny audacious and memorable It is a fantasy not unlike a cinder girl becoming a Princess This film was done very well I might add in the 70 s a time of the best experiments in film with being able to mention a person s sexuality This movie is not about a person being homosexual or not it is however about love in all it s strange forms This film does show some of the realities of being gay in the 70 s in Hollywood or in California Pretty boys being looked after by older not so pretty men Women who had to stay deeply locked in the emotional closet or risk not having a career Bathhouses were an integral part of the gay community br br THEN the fantasy begins Let us mix a lesbian with a gay and add some liquor and what do we have Well this movie which in ANY way was better than that dismal redo The Next Big Thing Perhaps someone should have asked the entire crew to see this movie and then try to do better br br I enjoyed this movie when I saw it in the 70 s and it still brings a smile to my lips now I heartily advise anyone who wants a funny tender movie to curl up with some popcorn and have some fun Some people need to lighten up And this is the film you should do it with br br
This movie is as unique as it is overlooked A Different Story is just that it shows how out of the need to survive or maintain one can find the capacity to love if you have an open heart as well as an open mind I first saw this on cable in the late 70 s and it truly depicted the limitations of the gay community at the time I believe this movie was ahead of its time in depicting a little slice of an obscure way of life It is truly a classic in the sense that it was a precursor to what is now depicted as the extended family This film should be available on DVD VHS so that not only the extra ordinary performances of Meg Foster Perry King can be acknowledged but to show how far we have come still have to go where relationships are concerned
In order to stop her homosexual friend Albert Perry King from being deported back to Belgium Stella Meg Foster decides to marry him The only other problem with that is that Stella herself is a lesbian The two have their separate lives when one night after Albert s birthday party they fall into bed and then into love Later in the film after falling in love Stella suspects Albert of cheating and shows up at his job one night late after closing What she finds will leave the viewer stunned This is a great film very original Perry King and Meg Foster are so good in their roles that it is amazing that they were not better recognized for their work here Very controversial upon its release in 1978 the R rated film is now PG in this much more liberal time br br Recently released on DVD the disc contains a Making Of segment on the special features and in it it s stated that the film was based on an actual story so the viewers who say the film is not real are mistaken Everyone is an individual and different people fall in love for different reasons these are the issues explored in this wonderful film for everyone who has ever loved
I appreciated the photography the textures the colours and often unlike one comment the lighting What was lacking for me was a coherent storyline I found it often disjointed badly edited and at times difficult to follow My version was 110 minutes IMDb shows one at 125m Possibly the cuts and subtitles didn t help I applaud any films that escape from the Hollywood mould but this left me disappointed Miss Gillain was luminous and the performances were all fine I just wanted a little more dialogue If anyone would like to see another film that has some affinity with this one try Hideous Kinky with Kate Winslet
This story is a complex and wonderful tale of the last Harem of the Ottoman empire well told and provoking we see the inner workings of a world now gone and learn about the people who lived there br br I enjoyed the story characters acting and scenes A few scenes suffered from quick editing and the sub titles sometimes disappeared too quickly otherwise a wonderful piece br br The main character Safiya is played wonderfully by Marie Gillain who I am pleased to say did a fantastic job without over doing it The scenes with her and Alex Descas Nadir are charming and lovely br br I recommend this film for anybody looking to watch something less Hollywood and more authentic to the world they are emulating
Harem Suare is the best film I saw in the year 2000 Bravo Ferzan Ozpetek Sensually shot and stunningly portrayed Harem Suare is a bold film that tackles interracial romance which is such a taboo in Hollywood Women of all shapes sizes and color populate the film Cut off from the outside world the women entertain each other by telling stories about intrigue rivalry and jealousies within their ranks
When I think about this movie all the adjectives that come to mind somehow relate to the physical appreciation of the world Texture smell color that s how I think this movie should be judged in terms of See the rich golden tones surrounding the young concubine asleep by the fireplace or the sweltering turkish bath and let it flood your senses with impressions of spice coarse cloth smooth skin scented oils flickering flames satin rustle Don t just watch and listen be absorbed let the droning voice of the storyteller mesmerize you
Dolph Lundgren is back Detention marks Dolphs first film in nearly 2 years and that is following the delayed Hidden Agenda This film still marks an improvement for Dolph over his cheapie trilogy of Jill Rips Agent Red and Stormcatcher However this film is well below the standard of Hidden Agenda which was better in almost every respect What this film does have in it s favour from Dolph s previous outing is a sense of cheesy fun The film also has a rejuvenated Dolph back in a high action role and it s good to see Dolph doing his own stunts again br br The films story is ludicrous and prime B movie material An ex military man is now a teacher and on his last day of teaching whilst taking a Detention class he runs into some Slovakian bad guys who have taken over the school to use as cover for a big drug deal The film has no originality but in a movie of this type you need to have a sense of fun with all the cliches If you take it too seriously the audience will find little to enjoy Thankfully the filmmakers don t take matters too seriously and along with all the action cliches you can think of and the predictability this film has a so bad it s enjoyable kind of vibe br br Where the film is let down is miss using a fairly decent budget The budget of around 10 million has not been well spent It s all up on screen with plenty of carnage and big explosions but a lot of the shootouts lack imagination The opening action is okay but after that the good moments become more sparse There are some good moments You have a car careering through school hallways for example and a decent shootout at the beginning with plenty of destruction The rest of the shootouts are fairly mechanical but there is plenty going on onscreen br br As for the cast Hidden Agenda boasted the best cast Dolph has worked with in ages There was a good standard of actors for a DTV film This however has problems The actors are on the most part bad The bad guys are terrible but the lead bad guy has a kind of enjoyable cheesiness because Alex Karsis plays it so over the top and without the hint of any menace that you can laugh at the pure badness The teenagers of the piece are actually good but they are playing such cliched characters They all hate authority each other and all have bad attitudes and of course by the end they learn important life lessons but generally they are decent and Chris Collins in particular has a likeability This movie is all about Dolph though While this film is nowhere near his best it is nowhere near his worst It also marks a turning point in his career He is now back in good shape and will be in even better shape in his next film Direct Action Dolph looks enthusiastic here he does all his own stunts and it is good to see him play the typical action man running from explosions in slow mo one liners and handling large weapons again in a movie like his older ones albeit with less flair and imagination than cliched films like Army Of One It is good to see Dolph looking energised His films of the last 8 or so years have seen Dolph looking a little more weary and using doubles a lot he still does all the fights himself though but the new streamlined Dolph seems up for it br br Overall this is watchable if only for the cheese value and Dolph in prime action man mode There s not a single surprise but it has a laughably inept kind of charm
This is a great entertaining action film in my opinion with cool characters lots of action and an amazing performance from Dolph Lundgren however Alex Karzis is awful as the villain The story is very good and i found the kids to be likable for the most part plus Dolph Lundgren is simply amazing in this The action scenes are excellent and it s almost like Die Hard except it s set in a school plus Kata Dob√≥ is very menacing and sexy as the sidekick The finale is very exciting and it has a couple of cool emotional moments as well however i just wished it had another villain because Alex Karzis just didn t cut it as the villain way too OTT and laughable for my tastes This should be higher then 4 1 in my opinion as i thought it was a great action film and while the kids were very stupid at times they got quite resourceful as the movie went along plus the shootouts were pretty cool as well The ending is very amusing and Corey Sevier s character was my favorite student plus Dolph has still got it This is a great entertaining action film in my opinion with cool characters lots of action and an amazing performance from Lundgren but Alex Karzis is awful as the villain still i highly recommend this one The Direction is very good Sidney J Furie does a very good job here with great camera work good angles and keeping the film at a very fast pace There is a bit of blood and violence We get lots of extremely bloody gunshot wounds knife in the side of the head bloody arrow hits an impaling and other minor stuff The Acting is fantastic Dolph Lundgren is amazing as always and is amazing here he is extremely likable kicks that ass as usual had great chemistry with the kids had an awesome character is very charismatic and he may not have shown a great emotional rage he still was a hell of a lot of fun to watch he is one of my favorite actors Lundgren Rules Alex Karzis is god awful as the villain he is laughably OTT was boring and not menacing at all he also annoyed the crap out of me Kata Dob√≥ is very sexy as the side kick and did fine with what she had to do she was the real villain in my opinion Corey Sevier is funny as Mick he was my favorite student and i really started to warm up to him in the 2nd half i liked him a lot he had good chemistry with Dolph too Dov Tiefenbach Willy Chris Collins Hogie Mpho Koaho Jay Tee Danielle Hampton Alicia Nicole Dicker Charlee all do great as the students Jennifer Baxter is very cute and is good as The fianc√©e rest of the cast do fine Overall i highly recommend this one 1 2 out of 5
this dolph lundgren vehicle is a fun die hard throwback action flick it isn t going to win any awards and its not very original but it delivers the goods you would want to see from a dolph lundgren movie our man dolph is an ex soldier who is now a teacher at a tough inner city high school and when it gets taken over by terrorists its up to him to save the day sure the script isn t going to win any Oscars its good fun and it has its fair share eplosive action dolph lundgren gives a good enough performance but he comes alive more in the action scenes and the rest of the cast are not the best actors but they hold it well all in all detention is an enjoyable action flick but youv e seen it a million times before
I just viewed Detention last night and i liked what i saw It was a cool fun movie Dolph looked superbly cool on the Bike He also looked good in this movie as compared to his other recent movies He is now in a pretty good shape The story was ok and the other actors were also passable I wouldn t call this movie his best but its still a good movie br br But it also had its share of Problems The first one was the way bullets were flying everywhere and even when they were being fired at point blank range they missed the target They should ve had shown the ppl escaping the bullets in a better way Another problem which i had was the way the students were swearing I dont know in which school the students can swear in front of their teacher and even in the classroom The third problem was that the bad guys were very few in numbers There should ve been more bad guys Last problem was definately the fact that the set looked cheesy but that was due to the small budget Overall the movie was a good Movie I enjoyed it I would recommend others to watch it P S Now u r a DEAD beat cop Some One liners were also cool br br
There has been a political documentary of recent vintage called Why We Fight which tries to examine the infamous Military Industrial Complex and its grip on this nation It is considered both polemical and incisive in making its case against both that complex and the war fiasco we are currently involved in in Iraq Yet a far more famous series of films with the same name was made during World War Two by Hollywood director Frank Capra Although considered documentaries and having won Oscars in that category this series of seven films is really and truly mere agitprop more in the vein of Leni Reifenstal s Triumph Of The Will scenes of which Capra recycles for his own purposes That said that fact does not mean it does not have vital information that subsequent generations of World War Two documentaries such as the BBC s lauded The World At War lacked nor does that mean that its value as a primary source is any the less valuable They are skillfully made and after recently purchasing some used DVDs at a discount store I found myself with the opportunity to select a free DVD with my purchase I chose Goodtimes DVD s four DVD collection of the series br br Rarely has something free been so worth invaluable While there are no extras on the DVDs and the sound quality of the prints varies these films provide insight into the minds of Americans two thirds of a century ago when racism was overt as in many of the classic Warner Brothers pro war cartoons of the era and there was nothing wrong with blatant distortion of facts The seven films produced between 1942 and 1945 are Prelude To War The Nazis Strike Divide And Conquer The Battle Of Britain The Battle Of Russia The Battle Of China and War Comes To America br br Overall the film series is well worth watching not only for the obvious reasons but for the subtle things it reveals such as the use of the plural for terms like X millions when referring to dollars rather than the modern singular or the most overused graphic in the whole series a Japanese sword piercing the center of Manchuria Yet it also shows the complexities of trying to apply past standards to current wars The lesson of World War One avoid foreign entanglements was not applicable to World War Two whose own lesson act early against dictatorships has not been applicable in the three major wars America has fought since Korea Vietnam nor Iraq The fact that much of this series teeters on the uncertainties of the times it was made in only underscores its historic value in today s information clogged times It may not help you sort out the truth from the lies and propaganda of today but at least you ll realize you are not the first to be in such a tenuous position nor will you be the last
The second of the Why We Fight Series concentrates on Hitler s grab of the Sudetanland and beyond as he makes a chump out of Neville Chamberlain and embarks on his conquest of Europe br br Clearly meant as propaganda in its day this series over the test of time has become an informative documentary as well with most of the Allied bias turning out to be historical fact The Fuhrer hoists himself on his own petard with smug pronouncements before his people and the world as he says one thing and does another as his army moves East The Czechs and Austrians quickly capitulate but the Poles put up an heroic struggle against overwhelming odds br br The disparity between Hitler s military might and Chamberlain waving the Munich treaty like a white flag declaring Peace in our time to this day has durable propaganda qualities Here in its original context it resonates even more powerfully as the darkness of World War ll sets in on Europe leaving the American viewer with two options freedom or slavery In 1943 there was no evading this simple truth and The Nazis Strike makes its point effectively
Adolf Hitler s maniacal desire to impose his will on the rest of the world is the subject of this second in a seven part series of films produced by the U S War Department as an instructional tool for new soldiers entering the Armed Forces during World War II Hitler s plan was methodical and well conceived starting with the conquest of Eastern Europe expanding to the European heartland then moving on to the World Island consisting of Europe Asia and Africa His final move would be to reach across the oceans for the ultimate conquest of the Americas and the World br br In 1935 Hitler ordered national conscription as the rest of the country fell under his evil spell Grade school children sang his praises and young German boys received training and indoctrination in military camps Marching unopposed into Austria in 1938 Hitler followed by annexing a strip of land bordering Germany and Czechoslovakia called Sudetenland In 1939 Hitler took all of Czechoslovakia Later in the year the world was stunned to learn that Germany signed a non aggression pact with it s mortal enemy Russia a ploy to delay Hitler s military involvement on too many fronts Immediately after Germany invaded Poland bringing Hitler s conquest right to Russia s doorstep He would deal with her later br br It was during this period that Britain still declined to oppose Hitler s thrust across Europe Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain felt he procured a great victory for his country by accepting a treaty with Germany his infamous declaration stating Peace in Our Time It didn t turn out that way br br The most fascinating information to be learned in this installment at least to me was provided by a small snippet of footage from a German pro Hitler rally in the mid 30 s It was led by a German American taking his cue directly from the homeland The venue Madison Square Garden
This great film is composed mostly of documentary footage is currently contained on a DVD along with Prelude to War The great American filmmaker and story teller Frank Capra made these films which simply and clearly call attention to the main points that caused World War II and Hitler s rise br br Every school child nay every American should watch these films today because they are so apropos History has been repeating itself over and over again The Lord Chamberlains are still alive and kicking the tactics used by the Nazis of infiltrating countries through sympathizers and then the Communists and now by Muslim terrorist groups are still working to these evil group s advantage br br By sitting back and letting Hitler as early as 1935 be aggressive France America and England caused over 50 million people s deaths Americans French and British today would happily let Hitler do exactly the same thing despite the fact that we should have learned from history what happens when you let dictators break treaties br br These great films may be too simplistic for World War II history buffs They don t tell the horrors that the Soviet Union caused simply because at the time America was teamed up with them fighting Hitler This film does tell the plain facts and motives that led to the terrible war
I can t understand what it is that fans of the genre didn t like about this film It was truly a lot of fun The special effects were wonderful I generally agree with reviews and with IMDB voters but not this time I waited until it came to home video which I felt was another reason that I wouldn t enjoy the film I believe special effects films need to be seen on the big screen but again this was not the case To me the film begs comparison to two films that were released around the same time Blair Witch and The Mummy Both films that I thought were terrible Blair was probably the most overrated horror film of all time The Mummy made gobs of money and it was pure dreck People liked it for it s special effects Films like the Mummy and The Haunting are not rich in character development they are more like funhouse rides Well with that analogy the Mummy was a B ticket to the Haunting s E ticket
What can I say that hasn t been said about The Haunting It has everything that would make a great picture Wonderful sets moody music and sound design to die for were all in place The screenplay though sometimes boggles the mind in such a weird surrealistic way The entire team must have forgotten to read it through maybe because they were too busy creating cg effects and building gothic sets to notice how weak the plot was Each member of the cast gives a worthy performance although with little conviction to the material at hand Lili Taylor has the most to do while the others mostly react to her But that s about it All I can say is that it was a slightly enjoyable two hours but you will definitely want more A lot more
What can I say about it It s another Hollywood s horror flick with very high budget 80 million dollars Not scary at all it offers us only a few thrills and one really creepy sequence with skeleton in the fireplace A lot of computer generated special effects and nothing more Catherine Zeta Jones is beautiful as always Lili Taylor is also a good actress The architecture of the Hill House is amazing all these monuments statues furniture Delicious However I don t like the ending because it was so luscious Check this one out and form your own opinion on it I give this picture 7 out of 10
I rented this movie this past weekend cranked up the surround sound system and got some great sound from special affects This movie is a great movie rental the special affects where enough to scare my fiance but I noticed some looked suprisingly computer generated I didn t go to the movies and see this but its a scary late night don t feel like going out movie I would recommend it
Some films just simply should not be remade This is one of them In and of itself it is not a bad film But it fails to capture the flavor and the terror of the 1963 film of the same title Liam Neeson was excellent as he always is and most of the cast holds up with the exception of Owen Wilson who just did not bring the right feel to the character of Luke But the major fault with this version is that it strayed too far from the Shirley Jackson story in it s attempts to be grandiose and lost some of the thrill of the earlier film in a trade off for snazzier special effects Again I will say that in and of itself it is not a bad film But you will enjoy the friction of terror in the older version much more
I don t know why the critics trashed this movie I hardly ever agree with them anyway br br The movie could have been a little scarier I don t usually go to Horror movies I even had to psych myself up to see it in the daytime I needn t have bothered The Cinema was full of kids too heh Liam was great as always I also liked Catharine Zeta Jones Theo and Lili Taylor Eleanor Nell br br The house was very Gothic and beautiful in a spooky way The special and sound effects were awesome I also loved the music score particularly the gentle tunes for Eleanor and her journey to save the children how she grew out of her stagnant routine and life and finally gain her power peace and freedom
I know it is fashionable now to hate this movie I have seen hundreds of spook films including he original 1963 Haunting as well as most of the Hammer films This film is not restrained and does not hold back at all which is probably why so many modern viewers seemed not to like it Yet many viewers can accept out of control films like Scream because knife killers are more easy to believe for most people than demons or ghosts Actually this film had many great scenes and the acting and special effects were great I have seen it 15 times now and it gets better every time The director of this film has made a number of interesting and stylish films and was not trying for the type of realism of the 6th sense The Haunting lets go and is certainly not boring Perhaps this film might appeal more to John Carpenter fans but more of an traditional plot structure The old Haunting was also a fine film from 1963 It was even more scary See both and also The Innocents and The Legend of Hell House with Pamela Franklin
The Haunting is a film that boasts a really creepy house good effects work and sound work a cast that seems to believe that everything around them is real and that house There are scenes that make you jump and the sinister aspects of what went on at Hill House in the past I found interesting There are genuinely creepy moments in the film and I liked the way the ghosts manifested themselves in sheets curtains and the house itself Jerry Goldsmith s score gave it the right atmosphere and the sound design had voices popping up around you What I wish could ve happened is for something a little more intense Jan De Bont had a PG 13 rating to contend with and I think that he held back a little too much Poltergeist scared me silly when I saw it many years ago and it still holds up The Haunting could ve used a few more scenes of pure terror The ending was for me a little anticlimactic Overall I enjoyed it The acting is good and there are moments that make you jump I just wish it scared me more
It seems to be a perfect day for swimming A normal family wants to gain advantage from it and takes a trip to the beach Unfortunately it happens that the father is trapped under a pier and neither his wife nor the small son is able to help him out of this whereas the tide is rising The woman Barbara Stanwyck takes the car and searches for help br br John Sturges short movie 69 minutes is powerful because of unanswered questions Stanwyck finds a guy who could help but there is a price she has to pay for this There is a double question the movie poses How far would you go to help the man that you love and on the other hand observing Stanwyck s behaviors towards the stranger does she really love her husband Like a good short story this movie leaves the viewer to himself with questions he can only answer himself
What a great Barbara Stanwyck film that I happened to see the other night Jeopardy was fantastic It was made in 1953 and probably for double bills but it kept me on the edge of my seat br br Barbara Stanwyck plays Helen who with husband Doug Barry Sullivan and son Lee Aaker drive to an isolated fishing spot in Mexico for a vacation Husband has a fall from the jetty and the only way he is to be saved is if Barbara drives back to a garage for some rope br br While there she runs into a psychotic killer Ralph Meeker one of my favourites and what follows is a game of cat and mouse as Barbara tries everything in her power to get Meeker to come back with her to free her husband br br The film was so suspenseful and such a surprise I was not expecting such a great film But I suppose I should have realized is there anything Barbara Stanwyck does that is anything less than wonderful
Jeopardy has the feel of being a stock movie of sorts one of the movies that the studios pumped out inbetween big budget box office ones It s a mere 70 minutes and doesn t feature many sets and the only star is Barbara Stanwyck But what a star of course br br Stanwyck is a tough lady once again as she runs into an escaped convict while seeking help for her trapped husband in the Mexican desert The majority of the movie is focused on how she deals with her captor who wants her to submit to him in exchange for his help Some psychological battling there br br It s a surprisingly effective little movie its short length makes it taut and that Stanwyck is great should go without mention but I ll still praise her every time
The only time I have seen this movie was when I was 10 years old I have remembered it all of these years as I couldn t sleep for a week or more after seeing it It just absolutely rattled me I was on vacation with my aunts in Ft Worth Texas and I will never forget it Now 48 years later my daughter is trying to get a copy of this for me to view as an adult It has taken a lot of research to find out what movie it was but I always remembered that Barbara Stanwyck was in it and finally was able to get the name and reviews on it I very much enjoyed it but it gave me quite a scare Jaqui
I like cheap perfume better it doesn t last as long Ralph Meeker s convict character Lawson tells this to Barbara Stanwyck s Helen character after he gets a whiff of the perfume that she picked out w her husband in Tijuana This line cracked me up and also seemed like a metaphor for this film that cheap is better than expensive because a cheap perfume loving man who has a way with a 2 x 4 is a better man to have around in the long run I agree with some of the other comments posted about Helen s attraction to Lawson Even though her narration states that she wants Lawson to be put away she did seem attracted to his fiery nature and that passion he stirred up in her wouldn t likely wash away with the tide
I found this movie to be suspenseful almost from the get go When Miss Stanwyck starts her narration it s only a few minutes until you realize that trouble is coming The deserted area the lock on the deserted gas station door everything sets you up to wait for it here it comes At first you think it will be about the little boy but all too soon you start holding your breath watching the tide coming in I found this movie to be really stressful even though I had watched it before and was prepared for the denouement Now a movie that can keep you in suspense even when you have seen it before deserves some sort of special rating maybe a white knuckles award
Jeopardy is a tense satisying thriller a cut above a B but not really a major production It qualifies as almost an experimental film as the studio that produced it Metro was desperately looking for new kinds of films stars and directors to compete with the then new medium of television The director John Sturges was an up and comer whose best years lay ahead He had just recently begun directing A level films and had already proved himself a most capable craftsman Stars Barbara Stanwyck Barry Sullivan and Ralph Meeker were at very different phases of their careers Stanwyck s glory years were behind her and yet she could still carry a film as she proves here Barry Sullivan as her husband was one of a dozen or so leading men who got started in films in the forties who never quite achieved the success many had hoped for him He was a fine low key actor poised but in an upper middle rather than upper class way which made him excellent in professional roles As the escaped convict who is the only person around who can save Sullivan s life he is trapped under a pier and the tide is rising Ralph Meeker is more energetic than usual This excellent actor had the misfortune of having come to films after Brando and Clift He was in his way as good an actor as either of them but he lacked charisma His bargaining with Stanwyck which comes down to his demanding sex in exchange for saving her husband by implication only as this is 1953 makes for an intriguing premise which had this been a different kind of film could all raised all sorts of interesting questions about Stanwyck s character Meeker is indeed a more exciting character than Sullivan and in her scenes with him Stanwyck is livelier than she is with her husband and son But as this is a formula picture not a Strindberg play the possibility that Stanwyck might want want to have a fling leaving aside the question of her husband s predicament remains unexplored In this sense the incoming tide doesn t quite have the effect one might have wished though the movie remains tense and highly entertaining thanks to excellent acting fine location photography nearly all of it outdoors and excellent direction by the woefully underrated Mr Sturges
Leonard Maltin must ve been watching some other movie Though I find his Guide to be quite a valuable resource please disregard his comments on this one He states starts off well then fizzles when it s really the reverse starts off tepid then catches fire The plot is about as simple as it gets Happy Mom Happy Dad and Happy Son take a vacation at an isolated beach Dad incapacitated in accident Mom runs off to get help meets up with dangerous escaped convict Mom tries to trick convict into helping while Dad waits and hangs on for dear life br br Good white knuckler given an electric jolt by Ralph Meeker appearing suddenly the director John Sturges films it in a clever way that will make you gasp around halfway through as the cunning desperate criminal Meeker is an unusually flippant reckless actor at least here and in the classic Kiss Me Deadly and he happily snatches the keys to the film s narrative and speeds off with the top down His character has a habit of grinning childishly and saying Pretty neat huh when he s especially pleased with his misdeeds There is a funny break in the action when they get a flat tire and he tersely instructs his hostage Barbara Stanwyck Don t go away She fires back Where would I go they re in the middle of nowhere and he realizes sitcom ishly Yeah that s right The friction between them is a hoot br br There are flaws somewhat ridiculous ones There s one scene where the police who have been chasing after Meeker for some time stop Stanwyck s car and to evade detection Meeker rests his head on her shoulder like a loving husband supposedly would and pretends to be asleep as she s being questioned A He looks conspicuously un masculine in this pose and B I think it s safe to say that any adult who appears to be asleep during an encounter with law enforcement would certainly arouse suspicion br br Still a sturdy thriller which builds to an exciting and edifying conclusion br br
Here s an excellent Barbara Stanwyck double bill on one disc The first movie and believe me the lesser of the two is MGM s To Please A Lady 1950 in which she is paired with Clark Gable It is essentially a star vehicle with Gable as usual dominating the film with his screen presence Here he plays a macho racing driver who gets some bad press from feminist reporter Stanwyck and the battle of the sexes begins Of course after much ado they eventually end up in each others arms and it all comes to a predictable and pleasing close A bit of a fluff of a move really but Gable and Stanwyck two icons of the Golden Age make it watchable br br But the real meat on this DVD is the second feature a marvellous and quite unknown little thriller called JEOPARDY Produced by MGM in 1953 this is a wonderful little gem of a movie that hasn t dated one iota Here Stanwyck plays the wife of Barry Sullivan and mother to their young son Lee Aaker on vacation on a deserted and remote Mexican beach when suddenly tragedy strikes A dilapidated wooden pier collapses trapping Sullivan under a heavy pylon and guess what Yes the tide is coming in With not a soul in sight and unable to free him herself Stanwyck sets off by car for assistance After driving some distance the only aid she can muster comes from an unscrupulous escaped convict Ralph Meeker who in return for his help wants more from her than money or a change of clothes I ll do anything to save my husband Does she or doesn t she br br Meeker runs away with the picture He turns in quite a brilliant performance Once he comes into the film you simply cannot take your eyes off him An actor in the smouldering Brando style he surprisingly never made much of his career in films Although he gave splendid performances as the unsavoury disgraced cavalry officer in the outstanding Mann Stewart western Naked Spur 1953 and as one of the doomed sacrificial french troopers in Stanley Kubrick s powerful WW1 drama Paths Of Glory 1957 his only real claim to fame was as Mike Hammer in Mickey Spillane s Kiss Me Deadly in 1955 His performance in Jeopardy should have done wonders for him but he had only a so so career in films He died in 1988 br br Because of this release Jeopardy can now proudly take its rightful place as a classic noir A memorable taut and exciting thriller thanks to fine performances tight direction by John Sturges the crisp Monochrome Cinematography of Victor Milner and an atmospheric score by Dimitri Tiomkin Extras however are no great shakes except for a radio version of Jeopardy and trailers for both movies br br This disc is also part of a Barbara Stanwyck box set celebrating her centenary Hard to believe that the lady would be over 100 years old if she was still around br br JEOPARDY an MGM winner
Does anyone else cry tears of joy when they watch this film I LOVE it One of my Top 10 films of all time It just makes me feel good I watch the closing production number with all the cast members over and over and over Bebe Benson Michelle Johnston is THE babe of the film IMHO I never saw the play but I get angry when I read reviews that say the play was better than the film The two are like apples and oranges The film making process will seldom deliver a finished product that is faithful to the original work I believe it s only due to the fear of public alienation that many well known works adapted to the screen aren t changed more than they are This is a very good film it is very satisfying That s all you need to know
As a disclaimer I ve seen the movie 5 6 times in the last 15 years and I only just saw the musical this week This allowed me to judge the movie without being tainted by what was or wasn t in the musical however it tainted me when I watched the musical br br I actually believe Michael Douglas worked quite well in that role along with Kasey I think her Let me dance for you scene is one of the best parts of the movie a worthwhile addition compared to the musical The dancers and singing in the movie are much superior to the musical as well as the cast which is at least 10 times bigger easier to do in the movie of course The decors lighting dancing and singing are also much superior in the movie which should be expected and was indeed delivered br br The songs that were in common with the musical are better done in the movie the new ones are quite good ones and the whole movie just delivers more than the musical in my opinion especially compared to a musical which has few decors The one bad point on the movie is the obvious cuts between the actors talking and dubbed singers during the singing portions for some of the characters but their dancing is impeccable and the end product was more enjoyable than the musical
When I really began to be interested in movies at the age of eleven I had a big list of must see films and I would go to Blockbuster and rent two or three per weekend some of them were not for all audiences and my mother would go nuts I remember one of the films on that list was A Chorus Line and could never get it so now to see it is a dream come true br br Of course I lost the list and I would do anything to get it back because I think there were some really interesting things to watch there I mean take A Chorus Line a stage play turned into film I know it s something we see a lot nowadays but back then it was a little different apparently and this film has something special br br Most of the musicals made movies today take the chance the camera gives them for free to create different sceneries and take the characters to different places A Chorus Line was born on a theater stage as a play and it dies in the same place as a movie Following a big audition held by recognized choreographer Zach Michael Douglas Richard Atenborough directs a big number of dancers as they try to get the job br br Everything happens on the same day the tension of not knowing the stress of having to learn the numbers the silent competition between the dancers And it all occurs on the stage where Douglas puts each dancer on the spotlight and makes them talk about their personal life and their most horrible experiences There are hundreds of dancers and they are all fantastic but they list shortens as the hours go by br br Like a movie I saw recently A Prairie Home Companion the broadcast of a radio show Atenborough here deals with the problem of continuity On or behind the stage things are going on and time doesn t seem to stop Again I don t if Atenborough cut a lot to shoot this but it sure doesn t look like it and anyway it s a great directing and editing John Bloom work But in that little stage what you wonder is what to do with the camera With only one setting Ronnie Taylor s cinematography finds the way making close ups to certain characters zooming in and out showing the stage from different perspective and also giving us a beautiful view of New York br br In one crucial moment Douglas tells the ones that are left Before we start eliminating you re all terrific and I d like to hire you all but I can t This made me think about reality shows today where the only thing that counts is the singing or dancing talent and where the jury always says that exact words to the contestants before some of them are leaving even when they are not good It s hard you must imagine at least here where all of them really are terrific br br To tell some of the stories the characters use songs and in one second the stage takes a new life and it literally is a dream come true The music by Marvin Hamlisch and the lyrics by Edward Kleban make the theater to film transition without flaws showing these dancers feelings and letting them do those wonderful choreographies by Michael Bennett The book in the theater also becomes a flawless and very short screenplay by Arnold Schulman which is very touching at times So if it s not with a song it will be with a word but in A Chorus Line it s impossible not to be moved br br During one of the rehearsal breaks in the audition Cassie a special dancer played by Alyson Reed takes the stage to convince Douglas character that she can do it The words let me dance for you never sounded more honest and more beautifully put in music and lyrics
I watched this movie after seeing it on Broadway I love the Broadway musical and I love the movie I watched the movie like it was not related to the Broadway show I am an avid reader and have seen what happens to most books when they are turned into movies so I developed a philosophy really early Assume that the movie is going to be based on the book or musical in this case but that while the story line may be similar it will not be the same it will be different so watch it for what it is br br I danced for 12 years before I had to make a choice I was a good dancer picking up chorus work in local productions as a child etc but I wasn t super talented I was however super talented as a show rider I was told by my dance instructor and my trainer who i spent several months a year at his farm out of state that I had to make a choice when I turned 14 That I needed to move up from dancing two hours four five days a week and riding 3 hours a day 7 days a week and dedicate to one or the other So I dearly love dancing and I love this movie and a lot of the other ballet and dance movies I just chose to watch this movie for what it is it is a great movie about raw emotion and human interaction It is about the power of anticipation and heartbreak when you work really hard to get something you want and you just do not get it I love the movie I love the Broadway musical
As many reviewers here have noted the film version differs quite a bit from the stage version of the story I have never seen the stage version of the story and therefore I have a more favorable review of the film than many other reviewers Perhaps Richard Attenborough was not the best choice for director of the film but the film is still an entertaining account of several dancers trying to make the big time in choreographer Michael Douglas show The film does right by not selecting any famous actors or performers to wind up in the final try out group This way our attention is focused on the dancers movements and individual stories and struggles as they unfold during a marathon day of try outs Douglas is also probably not the best choice for the part Apparently some songs were cut out in favor of a new one and the backstage clich√© ridden story of a romantic liaison between a dancer and the choreographer was added I have to say in all fairness this was the weakest part of the film The repeated intrusions Cassie made during try outs appear to mirror the almost desperate pleas one often has to make when engaging in the artistic professions in the absence of talent and or luck However this aspect of the film has been done to death in the past and it s curious to see this tired old shoe kicking its heel up once again The revelations of the dancers themselves began promisingly enough with the I can do that number but then it plodded a little at various points while the dancers were telling their stories Frankly their stories differed little from real life folks who never get a chance like this of 4 stars
This movie will always be a Broadway and Movie classic as long as there are still people who sing dance and act
This is a great film The first time I saw it I thought it was absorbing from start to finish and I still do now I may not have seen the play but even if I had it wouldn t stop me thinking that the film is just as good
I love this movie I mean the story may not be the best but the dancing most certainly makes up for it You get to know a little bit about each character the way THEY want you to learn about them I just think that you won t like this movie unless you re into Broadway
Anyone who has seen this movie and reviewed it poorly I would refer them to Roger Ebert s review of this movie He is one of the most respected Critics in the industry and he gave it 3 1 2 Stars br br This is a great movie It may not be perfect or spectacular but I enjoyed it A Chorus Line is not so much a story as it is a group of stories about the lives of Broadway hopefuls I read reviews where people said that too much time was wasted on the romance between Zach and Cassie That is an incorrect view It is another story along with all the other stories that are told about each of the Broadway hopefuls What people fail to realize is that those who are dancers for Broadway shows go through the same things that the common man goes through And that I think is really the point of the whole show It is to showcase not only the talent of these special dancers but to give us some poignant things to think about in regard to life in general This is a study of life as a Broadway star Anyone who has dreamed of becoming a Broadway star watches this movie with a great feeling of relationship because they have gone through exactly what the characters are going through br br This is a great musical It has its slow points and at times gets a little confused with the pacing of certain story lines but all in all I thoroughly enjoyed it Take a closer look at the movie and then maybe you will understand what I am talking about
hi for all the people who have seen this wonderful movie im sure thet you would have liked it as much as i i love the songs once you have seen the show you can sing along as though you are part of the show singing and dancing dancing and singing the song ONE is an all time fave musical song too and the strutters at the end with the mirror its so oh you have to watch this one
I don t agree with one of the reviewers who compared this film to the American International Pictures Basil Deardon has directed a brutally realistic film with an honest attempt to portray the rise of juvenile delinquency in post war England but without the sentimentality of Blackboard Jungle The cinematography was excellent as it really captured the scariness and isolation of the huge housing estate The estate looked like an old prison Stanley Baker was excellent as the hardened detective reassigned to the juvenile division Urgent urgent Larceny five iced lollies He finds he is the butt of many jokes David McCallum showed that he was one of Britain s top young talents of the fifties He had a very different role in another Stanley Baker film Hell Drivers His portrayal of Johnny and the fanatical following he inspired was very frightening Ann Heywood was also very good as the cynical Cathie I wouldn t say there was a romantic subplot in it br br Detective Jack Truman is investigating a string of arson attacks by someone labeled the Firefly Just as he finds evidence which could lead to a breakthrough he is assigned to the Juvenile Division he is pretty disgusted at what he feels is not proper police work Amid all the heckling he gets his first call out the 6 year old Murphy twins are working a scam at the local lolly shops br br Taking the twins home he meets their brother the charismatic Johnny and their embittered sister Cathie He starts to appreciate how life on the ghastly housing estates can turn young kids into criminals As he gets more involved with the family he realises there is a strong link between the fires Johnny and a frightened Chinese youth who works for a laundry The local priest Peter Cushing in an unusual role away from the Hammer horrors explains that when Johnny was younger he had rescued some people from a burning building and had been hailed a hero He wanted to recapture the feeling of importance and being useful and felt he could by lighting fires The school siege was filmed in a very real way and the viewer felt the children s fear the teacher thinking only of her own safety runs off and locks them in the room with the frightened gunman br br I thought it was a really excellent film that tried to show some of the social problems Britain experienced after the war br br Highly Recommended
I ve long wanted to see this film being a fan of both Peter Cushing and David McCallum I agree that the romantic sub plot was a waste of time but the talent of McCallum shines through this juvie role Thank heavens for Turner Classic which aired the show last week I can imagine that there were lots of problems with children after the war especially with the way things were throughout the 1950s Some of the boys are a bit scary I certainly wouldn t want to met them on a well lit street much less a dark one There were some good insights regarding the feelings of a firebug as well or as they call him a firefly
This film was shot on location in Gerard Gardens in Liverpool and was the UK s answer to films such as Blackboard Jungle The film stands the test of time quite well with all the moral stories still or even more relevant today The film feature some fine performance from some notable British actors such as David McCallum Stanley Baker Peter Cushing and Anne Heywood Baker plays a Liverpool cop assigned to juvenile liaison duties with the premise that if you catch the kids at an early age they will end up being responsible adults br br Notable cameos in the film include Freddie Starr Fred Fowell and Melvyn Hayes Gloria Tsai Chin and Michael Chow play brother and sister they are real life brother and sister who are caught up in an arsonists web Tsai Chin is still acting and can be seen in the latest Nicole Kidman film The Interpretor br br Violent Playground features a gun siege in a school so is unlikely to be shown on TV following similar events in Scotland Russia br br I lived in Gerard Gardens where the film was shot though was not born at the time and have fond memories of the area I have recently completed a documentary on Gerard Gardens which includes extracts from Violent Playground and a small UK film Coast to Coast which stars Lenny Henry and Pete Postlewaite The tenements were demolished in 1987 and the films go some way in keeping the memory alive br br There were some complaints from the residents when the film was released as the film portrayed the area in a bad light Time has helped heal those wounds br br A little gem of a film I would recommend you seek this out
This film was the first British teen movie to actually address the reality of the violent rock and roll society rather than being a lucid parody of 1950s teenage life In an attempt to celebrate the work of Liverpool s Junior Liaison Officers the opening title points out that 92 of potential delinquents who have been dealt with under this scheme have not committed a second crime However this becomes merely a pretext to the following teen drama until the film s epilogue where we are instructed that we shouldn t feel responsible or sorry for such delinquents however mixed up they might seem br br Stanley Baker plays a tough detective who reluctantly takes on the post of Juvenile Liaison Officer This hard boiled character is a role typical of Baker Having been currently on the trail of a notorious arsonist known as the firefly and does not relish the distraction of the transfer However as in all good police dramas he is led back full circle by a remarkable turn of events back to his original investigation br br His first case leads him to the home of two young children Mary and Patrick Murphy played by real life brother and sister duo who have committed a petty theft Here he meets Cathie satisfyingly portrayed by Anne Heywood their older sister whom he eventually becomes romantically involved with It quickly becomes obvious that the squalid environment of such inner city estates is a breeding ground for juvenile delinquency br br The elder brother of the Murphy family Johnny is the leader of a gang of rock and roll hoodlums McCallum does an eye catching turn as the Americanized mixed up kid who owes more to the likes of Marlon Brando than any previous British star One is reminded of Brando s character Johnny from The Wild One who led a leather clad gang of rebellious bikers in much the same way as this film s Johnny leads his gang br br Thankfully the preachiness of earlier Dearden crime dramas such as The Blue Lamp is not so apparent Instead we are presented with several well drawn out characters on both sides of the law as the drama of the delinquents and the romantic interest between Heywood and Baker takes the forefront br br The plot whilst at times predictable does deliver some memorable scenes The disruptive influence that rock and roll music was thought to have had is played out in a scene where Johnny abandons himself to the music leading a menacing advance on the police sergeant The most grippingly memorable piece of film however is the climatic classroom scene where a bunch of terrified school children including Mary and Patrick are held hostage at gunpoint by Johnny Obviously in the light of the real life Dumblaine Massacre this scene seems all the horrifying Understandably because of this the film is seldom aired or available to modern audiences
One of THE comedies of the 1970 s Also has the best signature tune of any comedy show The story is about three people sharing a flat living above their landlords George and Mildred The comedy rests on the mix of the people sharing A man and two women Richard O Sullivan is besotted with Paula Wilcox Its played in a gentle and not a leering way which is why this show was such a success br br The scripts and the stars were always giving the best performances and Richard s frustrated love life was shown with a relaxed charm The end titles contained visual jokes which went unnoticed in the early 1970 s but concerned the flat sharers living arrangements
Man about the house is a true situation comedy in every sense of the word The comedy concerns a character called Robin Tripp played by the great Richard O Sullivan who finds himself after a wild party ending up at the home of two ladies called Jo and Chrissy Ironically the party was held to say goodbye to their old flatmate The obvious ends up happening as he moves in br br Man about the house was a pre cursor to Cooke and Mortimer s spin off show George and Mildred which featured the 2 characters who were landlords to Jo Chrissy and Robin These two characters would actually turn out to be the linchpins of man about the house with Mildred the late and much missed Yootha Joyce in particular getting some of the best lines of the series A semi regular character was Larry Doug Fisher a useless person who was always on the scrounge and only ever came round when he wanted to borrow something and never to return it br br The American s did a version called three s company but it doesn t stand a chance when compared to this far funnier original Thames took a risk in producing a comedy about a man sharing a flat with 2 women at a very conservative time but they should worry as the ratings at the time suggest that around 20 million people just wanted to watch a good old fashioned bit of comedy with inspired casting and a sharp script What a pity modern comedy can t reach that high standard br br This programme is available on network DVD
As is nearly always the case when Britain comes up with an entertaining and or successful sit com or quiz show the Yanks will come along and poach the format and produce their own grossly inferior version Man About The House is of course no exception to that rule The Yanks version Three s Company was unwatchable braindead pap that seem to run forever A prime example of quantity over non existent quality The original on the other hand is a fondly remembered gem that had the savvy like Fawlty Towers to pull the plug at precisely the right time unlike the 637 episodes of hilarity that Three s Company came up with Jo was cute there was brilliant chemistry between the Ropers Richard O Sullivan made it all look so easy the scripts whilst not exactly Oscar Wilde standard were consistently funny and Chrissy was THE most drop dead gorgeous woman who has walked the face of this planet since The Dead Sea was merely feeling unwell Nuff said
While the British produced some hilarious and slick sitcoms in the 1990s Ab Fab Men Behaving Badly One Foot in the Grave etc the 70s were the real golden age br br In the 1970s there were whole new territories to explore including the sexual revolution feminism and the slowly evolving awareness of a need for sensitivity that would twenty years later become Political Correctness Attempts to grapple with the confusion of this thoroughly modern world were the subtle and not so subtle themes in everything from the skits of Monty Python s Flying Circus to sitcoms like Man About the House By the late 70s this grappling resulted in more meditative and bitter sweet sitcoms such as the masterpiece Butterflies br br Man About the House is a perfect example of the good Britcoms of the time slightly genteel cheeky fresh ingenuous sometimes outrageous with some well made observations on contemporary life Compare it to a cynical 90s show such as Ab Fab and it is hard to believe the two were created in the same country br br Man About the House is one of the great Britcoms of the 70s right up there with Good Neighbors The Good Life and About the House s spin off George and Mildred Its quality is attested to by the fact that as with Good Neighbors its creators writers and many of its cast have had continued success in British television
Some years ago satellite channel U K Gold promoted repeats of Men Behaving Badly with the hype Here it is the original flat sharing sitcom This was in fact untrue Man About The House was also a flat sharing sitcom and ran from 1973 76 br br It was the brainchild of Johnnie Mortimer and Brian Cooke creators of the popular sitcom Father Dear Father When it ended they decided they wanted to do something more in harmony with the times br br In the first episode Chrissy Paula Wilcox and Jo Sally Thomsett are tidying their Myddleton Terrace flat following a wild party when they find a man in their bath He is Robin Tripp Richard O Sullivan a Southampton cookery student of no fixed abode While his clothes dry out he puts on a ladies dressing gown and prepares them a meal They are so impressed by his culinary skills that they invite him to stay But there must be no naughty business So Robin has to pretend to be gay br br On B B C 2 s I Love 1973 shown in 2000 Julie Burchill claimed that House showed her a way of life she envied She was not alone One of the most iconic for me anyway images of 70 s British television was Sally Thomsett coming out of the London Underground carrying a parasol and a blind man doing a double take as her pert bottom swings past br br A man living with two girls was a risqu√© subject for the time but Mrs Mary Whitehouse had no need to get hot under the collar it was innocent good natured fun Mortimer and Cooke s scripts went as close as they could to the edge without crossing it br br Richard O Sullivan was still playing Bingham in I T V s Doctor In Charge when this got started In fact the second run of In Charge overlapped with the first of House He was born to play the sex mad Robin Paula Wilcox s Chrissy was more streetwise than Beryl her character she played in The Lovers while Sally Thomsett s Jo was a lovable dizzy blonde As time wore on he became almost like an older brother to them br br For many viewers Brian Murphy and Yootha Joyce stole the show as the warring Ropers George had lost interest in sex but Mildred had not They went on to their own show the aptly titled George Mildred The late Doug Fisher was good value as as Robin s wideboy friend Larry He worked so well he was made into a regular br br Within a year of its debut there was the inevitable movie spin off I am not a big fan of the Man About The House movie because I think it was stretched to fit the big screen Most of its characters had never appeared in the series br br The format was sold to America where it became the long running Three s Company starring the late John Ritter and Suzanne Somers It was far more suggestive than the British original with Somers often seen in sexy clothing br br After six seasons House ended with Chrissy marrying Robin s older brother Norman Norman Eshley Fans were devastated to see Robin failing to get the girl he loved but there was some consolation in the fact that he too landed his own show Robin s Nest
This is a better than average silent movie and it s still well worth seeing if you are a fan of the silents However if you aren t yet a fan of the genre I suggest you try a few other films before watching this one That s because the plot just seems pretty old fashioned and difficult to believe in spots But despite this it s still a good film and kept my interest br br A nice lady unfortunately hooked up with the wrong man and ran away to marry him The film starts five years later after she has come to realize that he is really a brutal thief Despite this she tries to make the best of it and not dwell on how good life had been before this jerk came into her life However the rent is due and there s no money so the lady is forced to look for work She becomes a personal seamstress for a rich lady whose husband is trying to swing a business deal Unfortunately the lady who they were trying to hook up a potential client with for a dinner party can t make it and the seamstress is paid handsomely to be the man s date Well like Cinderella she cleans up pretty well and the man is infatuated with her What to do now given that she is actually married and the new fella wants to marry her Well see the movie yourself to see how it s all resolved I DIDN T like how they handled the husband as it seemed awfully predictable and clich√©d However once he was out of the way I do admire how the film also DIDN T give up a by the numbers finale and left the film with a few loose ends br br All in all a very good film worth seeing but certainly not great
In watching this early DeMille work it was once again reinforced to me that early DeMille is far superior to late DeMille His attention to use of light within scenes is remarkable His pacing is very good enabling much to be told in the space of an hour or so It is a pity that he wasn t as intuitive about the style of his later sound films as he seemed to be in his silent films br br This was the first film in which I had seen Cleo Ridgely She was remarkable quite restrained and yet conveyed a broad spectrum of emotions br br The ending is wonderful
This film has a clear storyline which is quite unusual to the musical genre Cats Phantom of the Opera and other Andrew Lloyd Webber s musicals can be considered metaphorical as they use literary works as their framework Biarkan Bintang Menari BBM s storyline touches the very core of human relationships especially that of Indonesian people Despite the fact the film was based on a supposedly fairytale it s actually a fantasy of the child in Indonesian adults The dance sequences are not perfect yet the songs represent how Indonesians express themselves I reckon the choreographer should explore Indonesian way of dancing by not dismaying the fact that Indonesia s dance development tends to be more westernized The dance sequences seem awkward in some ways and not synchronized with the songs and or music Yet I still love this movie and regard it as a new wave of Indonesian film genre which I hope to improve in the future
And I am a Nicole Kidman fanatic I would pay to see and hear her read the Moscow phone book which for all I know she may have been doing when she was speaking Russian in this movie br br All four of the principals are excellent but the movie itself is a number of good images and better scenes held together by nothing br br While one is always ready to suspend disbelief while watching a movie this one asks too much of the viewer br br It could have been very funny which it is in parts or quite frightening which it is in one scene but the director didn t seem to know which way to go
I must confess that I was completely shocked by this film For one I went to see it on a whim expecting something mediocre but given this the most shocking thing was that this was in a populist American cinema at all This is British comedy at its finest dark quirky and funny in ways that American films just never are I must stop short however of recommending this wholeheartedly to anyone I went to see it with several people some English some European and some American and while some of us loved it mainly from the first two groups some hated it and found it worthless If you think you re into this kind of thing then go If not don t 10 10
I didn t really know what to expect when going out to watch the film apart from the slightly surreal basic plotline that a lonely man orders a Russian bride over the internet That and it had Nicole Kidman in it I absolutely loved the film though and came out thinking wow br br Refreshingly down to earth the film moves along nicely with a few suprises at each corner The relationships in the film are believeable with Nicole and Chaplin working against each other beautifully The humour is subtle with some great Office like scenes at the bank and the thriller element add tension without being Hollywood br br Overall the film is about real people in an unusual situation It s less about heroics and more about delicate relationships Brit filmmaking at its best br br 9 10
As usual Hollywood stereotyped EVERYONE in the movie But this one is a classic from the uptight white collar banker to the Russian woman Well done Even facial expressions were great Language was perfect even in Russian language and Nicole did a splendid job Hey guys you get what you pay for
Excellent movie albeit slightly predictable I have to comment on Nicole Kidmans acting in this movie Some of her other works haven t shown the amazing talent this woman has but Birthday Girl doesn t suffer from this in the slightest Even without words Kidmans acting shines through
I caught this on the dish last night I liked the movie I traveled to Russia 3 different times adopting our 2 kids I can t put my finger on exactly why I liked this movie other than seeing bad turn good and good turn semi bad I liked the look Ben Chaplin has through the whole movie Like I can t belive this is happening to me whether it s good or bad it the same look and it works Great ending 7 10 Rent it or catch it on the dish like I did
Good funny straightforward story excellent Nicole Kidman I almost always like the movies she s in This was a good vehicle for someone adept at comedy and drama since there are elements of both A romantic comedy wrapped around two crime stories great closing lines Chaplin very good here was also good in another good but unpopular romantic comedy Truth about Cats Dogs Maybe they re too implausible Ebert didn t even post a review for this The great screwball comedies obviously were totally implausible Bringing up Baby etc If you ve seen one implausible comedy you ve seen them all Or maybe people are ready to move on from the 1930s Weird Birthday Girl is a movie I ve enjoyed several times Nicole Kidman may be the killer app for home video
This is a great little film that s very unique and creative with some great plot twists and wonderful performances All the characters are great and the story while bizarre is fascinating and very interesting plus Nicole Kidman is simply amazing in this It s very hard to describe this movie because it really is quite bizarre it s a comedy romance one minute then it turns into a thriller the next however it was still very entertaining all the same plus Nicole s Russian accent was fantastic and extremely convincing Chaplin and Kidman had very good chemistry together and i loved Vincent Cassel s performance plus some of the plot twists really took me by surprise The ending was very cute and it s unpredictable throughout plus this movie is quite underrated as well You will feel sorry for Chaplin and the way that he is scammed and i thought all the characters were really likable plus the finale is especially good This is Nicole s movie though and she carries it with her incredibly sexy performance This is a great little film that s very unique and creative with some great plot twists and wonderful performances i highly recommend this one The Direction is very good Jez Butterworth does a very good job here with great camera work solid angles and keeping the film at a fast pace The Acting is wonderful Nicole Kidman is stunningly gorgeous and is amazing as always she is incredibly sexy very likable had one of the coolest accents added a lot of presence had very good chemistry with Ben Chaplin and had a very mysterious character she was amazing Kidman Rules Ben Chaplin is great here he is extremely likable had a cool character had very good chemistry with Kidman the only thing i didn t like was him taking out his anger out on Kidman even though what she did was wrong and i loved how he got revenge in the end Vincent Cassel is fantastic as the main villain yes he was OTT but he was very intense and quite creepy at times this role was perfect for him Mathieu Kassovitz is OK here but didn t have much to do Rest of the cast are fine Overall i highly recommend this one 1 2 out of 5
I ve had a lot of experience with women in Russia and this movie portrays what a lot of them are like unfortunately They are very cunning ruthless and greedy as well as highly unfair From the robotic sex the hustling for gifts to the lies and betrayal I ve experienced it all in Russia br br I know what I m talking about And here are my qualifications Here are the photojournals of my three trips to Russia in search of a bride It includes thousands of pics of many hot Russian girls I met black comedy scams I was privy to and the story of my mugging and appearance on Russian national TV br br http www happierabroad com Photojournals htm br br It s like Reality TV You will love it I spent a ton of time putting it together So check it out The Russian woman that Nicole Kidman plays is a lot like the Julia and Katya in my photojournals br br My 3 bride seeking trips in Russia happen to be very exciting and would sell so why don t they make a movie out of my bride seeking adventures in Russia However there is one factual impossibility in this film and that is the way which the guy orders his bride from a catalog and having her arrive at an airport It doesn t work that way at all so I don t understand why the media likes to perpetuate this There isn t a single Russian bride introduction website that works this way and I challenge anyone to find one that does The fact is you can only order the Russian lady s CONTACT INFO email address phone number etc from the website From there you correspond and then visit her and if you want to bring her to your country you start the immigration process at your INS office and wait months after that That s how it works in real life You can t just order her to arrive at your airport US Immigration would NEVER allow such a thing to happen br br WuMaster br br I got everything I wanted by going abroad You can too http www happierabroad com
Nicole Kidman is a wonderful actress and here she s great I really liked Ben Chaplin in The Thin Red Line and he is very good here too This is not Great Cinema but I was most entertained Given most films these days this is High Praise indeed
Every time I see Nicole I like her more I love a movie like this A woman you just won t give up on but she keeps breaking your heart First movie I remember seeing like this was Of Human Bondage the Kim Novak Laurence Harvey version The beefs about the correctness of the Russian spoken in this film are petty it was good enough to fool me or anybody else who can t speak Russian I m sure Funny how people miss the point The no goodnik Russian guys were well cast too Finally I have to tip my hat to Ben Chaplin as somebody else noted he plays a sap with great dignity and there was definitely some heat between him and Nicole To think guys get PAID for that mind blowing
Modern original romantic story br br Very good acting of both Nicole Kidman and Ben Chaplin br br Miss Kidman does a nice job in imitating a Russian accent Ben Chaplin is also good as the shy dull clerk For the men and some women miss Kidman looks fantastic and is very sympathetic I forgot what a gorgeous woman she is It s not hard to imagine that John falls in love with her Some unexpected turns in the story are good for the suspense Although I hoped for a happy ending the last part of the movie was quite a surprise for me br br Conclusion good movie br br Les Pays Bas huit points
A small funny film It is totally incredible unbelievable impossible But it is funny how an introverted masochist can become totally dependent and mesmerized even hypnotized by a girl he hardly knows but who was able to get down into his phantasms Of course it is a denunciation of the foolish deals you can get to on the Internet You must not believe ten percent of what you re told there and never ever ever accept to tie up your hands in a way or another to someone or something or some organization you do not know personally Most of their businesses there are in a way or another going to fool you and raid you But here the chap deserves being the victim of such gangsters because he is not only naive he is absurdly silly But then the film becomes funny because it ends up with the victim of the crooked business having the upper hand and ending up playing the same game with his victimizer and winning One think is sure too Security in English airports is not exactly what it should be but I guess it s not better anywhere else in the world and even now they have tightened up all rules and regulations it is just fun to go through their procedures and foil them systematically Then they have their vengeance by losing your luggage a real plague on modern airports and don t expect to get fair compensation Or even confiscating a bottle opener or a can opener because it may be dangerous I can see myself cutting my way through the side of the plane with a can opener Funny isn t it Dr Jacques COULARDEAU University Paris Dauphine University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines
When I saw Birthday Girl I liked it so much I set out to see every Nicole Kidman film I could only to find all of them a disappointment compared to it I theorize that while the presence of a particular star usually guarantees a certain level of quality because of their artistic control with Nicole Kidman the influence she exerts is detrimental to film enjoyment IMHO Thus for instance Dogville even depriving the viewer of anything visual to detract from the existential insight she is hammering home or other films promoting gay and lesbianism as worthy of anyone else s attention or other pet causes of Kidman s br br Here she is a natural woman and she does a really great job I don t how or who was able to restrain her but apparently it worked The way the film depicts her openness despite her resistance gets to the heart of what makes a woman a woman And consequently what makes a man s most desperate hopes marginally attainable br br Of course the fact the male lead transforms from a milquetoast clerk to macho man in the space of one film sounds like a male ego expansion fantasy but his transformation is adequately believable It isn t coyly contrived as it would be in a film engineered to bolster male ego Instead it accurately records necessary growth arising from the films unique circumstances br br Also quite charming is the way the criminals are portrayed as perfectly human apart from their criminal mission Her gang has a coed rough and tumble fellowship which is foreign to American culture And while they are his adversaries they are never really his enemy In effect they teach him to be compete br br I really marveled at Kidman s ability to physically appear Russian It had me wondering whether her ancestry was Russian but none of the photos of her I examined showed any hint of it Maybe it is just makeup but it was amazing br br I can only hope that they knock her over the head again soon so she can turn out another great film Despite my gratuitous digs at Ms kidman the message is this is a superior film in every way and probably the role of a lifetime
This is a comedy based on national stereotypes no doubt If you leave away pretending you know or you care what Communism was about and how real Russians or Brits are if you accept and are not hurt by the conventions you can have fun with this film Nicole Kidman is at her best sexy moving and funny Ben Chaplin succeeds to avoid being completely out shadowed by Nicole and the rest of the cast does good work as well The final is moving and logical movie logics of course Worth watching if you accept the rules of the game
The critics didn t like this film It bombed in the States and as a result received only a limited showing in Britain Which was a great shame because it represents British rather than American humour and should have been shown in Britain first br br Nicole Kidman looks stunning and is a totally convincing Russian Ben Chaplin is the Dustin Hoffman character from The Graduate and Birthday Girl has at least 4 scenes which remind the viewer of that 1960s classic despite being a totally different story br br Sure it changes tack a number of times from comedy to black comedy to thriller to adventure but it s memorable moving and a weclome breath of fresh air compared to the average mega budget blockbuster br br See it with an open mind
From what critics and audiences indicated BIRTHDAY GIRL had to be a big fat clinker Still because I love Nicole Kidman I decided to rent it last night It proved to be quite worthy of watching Sure it isn t your basic American comedy and it doesn t take a genius to realize that it is a very British movie but that s why I liked it It was a change from all the other movies around a breath of fresh air Sure there were some plot holes but overall it worked First off Kidman was fabulous again in a very different not very glamorous but still quite sexy role She just keeps proving that she is one of the top talents in Hollywood Not only is her Russian accent when she speaks English effective but there are times when she carries on long conversations in Russian and if you didn t know it was Nicole Kidman you would never question her authenticity Harrison Ford should have taken note in K 19 Overall a slight little movie that works despite the horrible buzz
This film is definitely an odd love story Though this film may not be much to shout about Nicole Kidman carries the film on her own the rest of the cast could quite easily be forgotten though Ben Chaplin does do quite a good job of Hertfordshire Life with shots of St Albans Hemel Hempstead town centre depicting the true essence of the area What starts outlooking like a regular episode of the popular British TV series Heartbeat soon turns into a gritty gangster getaway action flick Nothing truly memorable happens in this simple small film and thus ends up as fairly decent weekend entertainment A good one to watch and if you like the hero john are lonely thirty something you may find something to identify with in his character
Are you a giraffe ask John to Nadia and she sure of responding well responds him yes In this way begin the communication between a man and a woman who don t know each other and at the same time the questions and doubts in Birthday Girl A film that i heard a lot of times but i don t dare to see until two hours of write this br br Birthday Girl is a passionate movie that makes me fall in count at the same time that Nicole Kidman is one of the best actress Besides she is pretty and intelligent that i have ever seen Birthday Girl is the story of a lonely and routine man who looks for a wife at internet The woman that he finds comes from Russia She seems to be that delicate woman normal not more One day in her birthday comes suddenly his cousin and his friend The man begin to discover certain things Since here he don t going to be the lonely and routine man that always have been br br Much of us going to think that this movie is just a regular one with a exploited plot Much of us going to think that the action and thrills are sure and don t novel But Birthday Girl is just the opposite This movie is full of good surprises good performances and a imaginative plot that i had never seen and imagined This romantic thriller with certain funny touch is an excellent natural film with a lot of proposes for the films of it kind Birthday Girl have certain beauty and crudeness in its scenes but at the same time certain touching nature and makes it so deeper br br Birthday Girl is sometimes sad sometimes funny sometimes violent but at the end is totally satisfactory And I m not sorry in say that this is a masterpiece br br Sorry for the mistakes well if there any
The trailer for this movie didn t do the movie justice And while the movie didn t know what it really wanted to get across the first half of the movie being a light romance comedy and the second have a more serious romantic drama the overall impact was much better than I thought it would be This movie was more of a date movie but the trailer made it into more of a suspense thriller which it never really turned out to be Kidman being one of my favorites of course I m biased but this movie proved to be a light sensitive if somewhat quirky movie that deserved better Three out of four stars 9 5 02
This is a good example a film that in spite of the low rating is more than worth watching The story is engaging and it doesn t take long before the chemistry between Nicole Kidman and Ben Chaplin grabs your attention The acting is first class and the characters are represented well Sometimes it feels like the director couldn t decide himself between drama and romantic comedy Ben Chiller s portrayal of the law abiding and shy Englishman with porn S M magazines hidden in the bedroom creates plenty of moments for laughs As does the look in Nicole Kidman s eyes when she is offering John his first taste of intimacy in a long time Other times the actors and especially Nicole Kidman give this comedy quite expertly a dramatic slant
For a film that got little publicity and few people have heard about this was pretty good It s another one of these modern day British crime films that are quirky Snatch Sexy Beast etc It s not wild like Snatch but it s interesting and it has some rough characters br br It also has a corny and somewhat predictable ending but early in the show not late has some neat twists to make it very interesting for the first time viewer Basically it s about a low key British male who sends away for a Russian mail order bride who winds up with the aid of two Russian male friends providing a couple of big surprises br br Ben Chapin and Nicole Kidman co star and are very good as are Vincent Cassel and Matthieu Kassovitz as Kidman s Russian cohorts This is a different kind of film and well acted Kidman once again proves she s far more than just a beautiful face
John Ben Chaplin is a lonely bank clerk who lives in a small town not far from London Though the Internet he contacts a Russian agency of brides He selects Sophia Nicole Kidman the guy could be lonely and shy but certainly has a good taste doesn t he and when they met each other he realizes that she does not speak English The communication between each other is basically limited by sex again imagine what a terrible situation for the guy just have some kinky sex with Nicole Kidman On her birthday two Russian friends of her visit them Then lots of surprises will happen I liked this movie first it is almost impossible to be labeled Is it a black comedy an action a thriller movie I believe all the choices are correct Nicole Kidman is gorgeous as usual and I am very curious about her Russian is she speaking Russian in a correct accent indeed or just faking Anyway I found it an enjoyable movie My vote is eight br br Title Brazil A Isca Perfeita The Perfect Bait
This movie really woke me up like it wakes up the main male character of this bravely different movie from his life slumber br br This guy John Ben Chaplin leads his mediocre safe life of a bank teller in a small provincial English town until the stunningly gorgeous wild girl to die for Nadia Nicole Kidman ordered by email from Russia enters his life to become his beloved wife by Johns plan However a glitch turns up Nadia does not speak a word of Johns language Although calm and emotionless on the outside John becomes so interested in beautiful Nadia that instead of using the full refund policy of the matching service he buys her a dictionary to start the communication process br br What happens henceforth in the plot really shakes poor John from his slumber of a decently paid safe feeling clerk into a decision making decently thinking action figure giving the viewer a subliminal message you would have probably acted likewise br br Kidman Cassel Kassovitz make a great team acting Russians and they are almost indistinguishable from the real thing almost only due to the slight accent present in their Russian dialogues however slight enough to amaze a native Russian by the hard work done to get the words sound right Nicole Kidman proves her talent once again by playing a character quite different from the previous roles at least from the cultural background br br The pace of the film is fast and captivating and you certainly are not ready to quit watching when the end titles appear you rather feel that you re in the middle of the plot and are left with a desire to see the sequel as soon as it comes out br br My advice is to go out and get this film immediately and watch it and enjoy To sum it up it has an unusual plot great acting and ideas below the surface Like the idea of the rude awakening from the artificial safe routine life of a wheel in a Society s machine the life which members of the Fight Club were so keen to quit and the machine of which Pink Floyd sings Welcome to the machine I bet that in the end John was rather off with Sophia on their way to the unknown than not having met her at all br br Thank you writers for the great story and everyone else for this great movie Please make a sequel And you can stage it whereever and name the location whatever because the authenticity of the place is irrelevant to the 99 9999 percent of the potential viewers I am sure of it
I really have to disagree with guy yardley rees who should he have watched the entire film would have seen some absolutely stunning Scottish scenery some of the best ever shot in Skye and found a film with a difficult start come together into a really poignant whole br br This is not a big budget film Rather it is a film that has a strong community feel br br I can t say how much standard films bore me pushing out the same polished stuff again and again Seachd doesn t seem to be about that at all It really seems to be trying to offer something more real and certainly more Gaelic than any recent Scottish film br br OK so the acting isn t in the style a blockbuster That s because the actors are seemingly real people I actually thought that the key roles of the boy and his Grandfather were really convincing and at times unusually beautiful br br Seachd really bears a second viewing since there are many threads that become clearer second time around that really do feed into the ending br br Overall the combination of music and at times stunning visuals plus a community approach to the acting and non normal structure has turned Seachd into quite a distinctive and memorable film More of these please
I would highly recommend this movie And I certainly shall be personally recommending it to my friends and family here and abroad It was with excited anticipation that I have just pre ordered it online I enjoyed it so much It is not out until February March 2008 but it will be well worth the wait But first go and see it in the cinema if you can There is nothing quite like the Cinema Experience of a cinema made movie Insist that your local cinema puts it on I went to see Seachd the Inaccessible Pinacle tonight down here in London and was really impressed It is a marvel a truly beautiful film set in the Scottish Highlands you will laugh you will cry you will be moved in may different ways you will be intrigued and as the story within the stories is revealed you will be amazed at that revelation br br This movie is in Scottish Gaelic with English Subtitles but do not let that detract you if you are not a speaker of the Gaelic I am just starting and my son does not nor did many people there tonight and it did not spoil it for us by any manner of means Superlatives do not suffice The photography is superb there is no CGI here and the movie is all the better for that here you have true photography The script is so skilfully and subtly written The many layered plot weaves the magic art of the ancient storytellers The music is at times rousing at times haunting but always adding to the atmospheric ambiance And the acting it is to behold and the actors they the true weavers of this delightful yet profound film particularly the two main actors Padruig the young and Padruig the elder A true bard if ever there was who both carried a very heavy load And the Direction Well watch out Richard And the Producer responsible for raising funding hiring key personnel and arranging for distributors A task well done I hope that you will make sure that distribution goes out to our communities abroad And the Gaelic community Uill without you it could not have happened We were told that this movie was made on a low budget but you would not know it and I think it might well be because for what they might have lacked in money they more than made up for with the richness of the heart and the warmth and co operation of the local Scottish Gaelic community br br A heartfelt thanks to all concerned in the making and the sponsoring of Seachd M√≤ran taing Many thanks From the Gaels to the World From the World to the Gaels
This movie is best described or compare to Big Fish the movie by Tim Burton But it s a less glamorous and more in you face tale And of course here it s not the father but his grandfather who tells the stories br br The movie s narrative also moves back and forth so the story outline here at IMDb might tell you more than you would like to read before watching the movie It s funny and engaging enough even though you get from one story to another and have some dramatic moments too It also surprises you here and there with things you wouldn t expect A nice little movie then that deserves your attention especially if you like movies like that o
An angry boy who has tragically lost his parents is looked after by his grandfather Together they find common ground in the Gaelic folk tales which have been passed down orally from generation to generation of islanders Although tragic episodes such as the Highland clearances feature in the stories there is a surprising amount of humour and gaiety in them It s all filmed in Skye so there is a double dose of beauty The mountain scenery is breathtaking and it s a rare chance to hear Scottish Gaelic spoken I m English so I had to read the subtitles but the sound of spoken Gaelic is nonetheless wonderful The performances are just what you would expect from carefully chosen non actors in other words you are watching the real thing people who care deeply about Gaelic folklore and history The Gaelic community especially on Skye worked innumerable minor miracles to make this film Anyone who has the slightest interest in Gaelic folk history folk music oral culture Scotland British history multi culturalism or social justice should go and see this film
The Scots excel at storytelling The traditional sort Many years after the event I can still see in my mind s eye an elderly lady my friend s mother retelling the Battle of Culloden She makes the characters come alive Her passion is that of an eye witness One to the events on the sodden heath a mile or so from where she lives br br Of course it happened many years before she was born but you wouldn t guess from the way she tells it The same story is told in bars the length and breadth of Scotland As I discussed it with a friend one night in Mallaig a local cut in to give his version The discussion continued to closing time br br Stories passed down like this become part of our being Who doesn t remember the stories our parents told us when we were children They become our invisible world And as we grow older they maybe still serve as inspiration or as an emotional reservoir Fact and fiction blend with aspiration role models Warning stories Archetypes Magic and mystery br br My name is Aonghas like my grandfather and his grandfather before him Our protagonist introduces himself to us And also introduces the story that stretches back through generations It produces stories within stories Stories that evoke the impenetrable wonder of Scotland its rugged mountains shrouded in mists The stuff of legend Yet Seach d is rooted in reality This is what gives it its special charm It has a rough beauty and authenticity tempered with some of the finest Gaelic singing you will ever hear br br Aonghas Angus visits his grandfather in hospital shortly before his death He burns with frustration Part of him yearns to be in the twenty first century to hang out in Glasgow But he is raised on the Western shores among a Gaelic speaking community br br Yet there is a deeper conflict within him He yearns to know the truth The truth behind his grandfather s ancient stories Where does fiction end And he wants to know the truth behind the death of his parents br br He is pulled to make a last fateful journey to the summit of one of Scotland s most inaccessible mountains Can the truth be told Or is it all in stories br br In this story about stories we revisit bloody battles poisoned lovers the folklore of old and the sometimes more treacherous folklore of accepted truth In doing so we each connect with Angus as he lives the story of his own life br br Seachd The Inaccessible Pinnacle is probably the most honest unpretentious and genuinely beautiful film of Scotland ever made Like Angus I got slightly annoyed with the pretext of hanging stories on more stories But also like Angus I forgave this once I saw the bigger picture Forget the box office pastiche of Braveheart and its like You might even forego the justly famous dramatisation of The Wicker Man To see a film that is true to Scotland this one is probably unique If you maybe meditate on it deeply enough you might even re evaluate the power of storytelling and the age old question of whether there are some truths that cannot be told but only experienced
Teresa Pavlinek was a popular member of the Toronto Second City cast She has done numerous guest spots and commercials up here in Canada Finally someone has the sense to create a show for her The supporting case seems quite good too I have now watched the pilot several times and I still find it refreshing Though I am not sure why the show is listed as The Jane Show 2004 I might be wrong But as far as I am aware the show was conceptualized in 2005 and appeared on Global TV in Canada in early 2006 It is a fresh idea and hopefully it does well Too bad this couldn t be paired up with Corner Gas Now I know Corner gas is on CTV but the two shows would be great companion pieces
I m watching this on the Star World network overseas which buys American and Canadian series that last one or two seasons like The Jane Show I thought of how many female lead comedy shows Im actually able to watch on my own There s Lucy Bewitched I Dream Of Jeanie the one with Barbara Feldman and then my mind goes kind of blank I cannot think of any others the women are all supporting roles not the lead So for me The Jane Show is in pretty good company One thing I just thought of though I ve watched several things made in Canada and I never recall any thing being filmed in a regular TV series that shows SNOW It s all made at the height of summer LOL Granted it s a great place to live climate wise in the summer but you would THINK they would show a little bit of Canada in the winter since that s part of the lifestyle there also I mean SCTV Just For Laughs come to mind as two comedy shows that lasted a long time filmed in Canada and very little or none is shot with snow present even though they both do a lot of outdoor shots I digress but I kind of chuckle at Jane and her obviously liberal ways being accused of racism to her neighbor and I like the bald guy and his craziness I found it on par with a UK series called The IT Crowd I Think another office comedy with a female lead Not by any means the best comedy ever but for a guy to say he can watch it alone thats saying something If I was with my wife she might really enjoy it since it addresses sex in the office and stuff like that so might be a good light comedy for couples to watch 7 of 10
Excellent show Instead of watching the same old sitcom type shows where it s the same old thing just different stars this refreshing show provided an incredibly entertaining view of office situations We have been away from watching any television for 2 years and after coming back of all the shows available we look forward to watching this show on W Shame on Global for pulling the plug on this one I thought this one would be a winner Let s be realistic about things FEW Canadian SHOWS make it Everyone I talk to enjoys this show and I believe it was foolish of Global to walk away I guess they want to stick it out with the typical mind numbing shows from the States instead of pulling behind a Canadian made show that had a lot of promise Don t get me wrong I enjoy a lot of shows on TV but come on people let s keep the variety This unique show provided a very comedic view of a slightly exaggerated realistic side of office life and relationships with unique characters that you don t see on any sitcoms today or in the past Too bad that global had to say no to this one foolish mistake
Spacecamp is my favorite movie It is a great story and also inspires others br br The acting was excellent and my wife and I went to see Lea Thompson in Cabaret years later due to her performance in the movie It is unfortunate that the Challenger Accident delayed and hurt the movie br br The 20th Anniversary of the Challenger Accident is coming up I knew one of the Challenger Astronauts off and on since childhood on the Carnegie Mellon campus where my father went to school I also know a close friend of the late pilot br br I was the technical review last year for National BSA for the Boy Scout Astronomy Merit Badge and I still find Spacecamp a great movie to recommend to Scouts doing the Space related merit badges I teach br br I ran into the late astronaut again as an adult and was following a schedule of engineering education we had put together when Challenger blew up I wound up sitting in with Willard Rockwell and his engineers invisible going over things after the Accident at the Astrotech stockholders meeting by chance as a result so I m much closer to the Accident and any movie similarities I made sure that I was a good student and finished the degree four years later strangely enough on the recommendation of the Rockwell engineer who told them not to fly Challenger in 1986 and who later built Endeavour
Spacecamp is a movie that I plan to show my Daughter Julia Ann Ruth Morgan some day Seeing Joaquin Phoenix in this movie makes you realize how far hes come since playing a Roman Emperor in the film Gladiator I am pleased to say that I now have comms with the Artificial Intelligence of QE2 who said that I was Young and that is true Holodeck Comms with my Daughter on Coaltrain came through Coaltrain Gate Julia Ann Glow Hide Daddy The fact that my Daughters Artificial Intelligence is still speaking like a six year old means that my Daughter Julia Ann Ruth Morgan representing Peace to the friendly Ki Alien Creators of humans may not have been taken to a an American Bunker in time We have the power to change the future with Faster Than Light comms I order that my Ex Wife and Daughter Julia Ann Ruth Morgan be taken to an American Bunker as soon as possible My Daughter Julia is 23rd in command of the Planet Earth and a bridge officer She already said that she doesn t like bullies Having had someone steal her Gameboy and Gauntlet II game from my Mothers car she gets concerned about other thieves stealing her other toys Julia has been growing up fast The time of JFK and QE2 starting life over again on this planet is not until 2023 Julia would be a Young Lady by then and her artificial Intelligence would have been greatly expanded upon If I have to go to a bunker to continue the American Leadership then I am in a command post and not really hiding as a first priority President Jack Kennedys artificial Intelligence said recently that drastic measures could be taken to stop Global Warming at any time Thanks boss thats similar to my Daughter Julias AI telling me hide and stay indoors Kate Capshaw is now married to Steven Spielberg Wow are we ever going to miss his movies if society collapses If you value freedom of speech like President Kennedy and myself then please do not delete this reviewer Check out Joaquin Phoenixs other movies also
Hurrah A space film that doesn t take itself too seriously and everyone can come along for the exciting ride that is space camp The film starts slowly the usual mix of idiots and high fliers mixed together into a dodgy soup But when the going gets tough the tough get themselves sorted out and it s not an un believable change in the characters as you can believe that there s some responsibility in their young minds br br The only flaw in the film is that Kate Capshaw is EXTREMELY annoying as the I m right and you re all wrong instructor I would recommend this as a nice night in movie and a 7 Vote
This is one of the most guilty pleasure movies ever br br I am embarrassed to say that my favorite character is TISH but still enjoy watching her make her space outfit like super cool with a like totally bitchin belt and stick on rhinestones on her face br br But anyways the movie is actually one of the few family movies that holds your interest I know that the begining drags particuarly if you know what is going to happen but the second half is probably one of the most nerve wracking segments in a family film br br I wouldn t stand up in front of millions of people and proclaim to love this movie in fact renting it is pretty embarrassing itself but I ll admit it here with the internet to hide behind br br
Spacecamp is one of the movies that kids just love and mom and dad can have fun watching as well Growing up in the 80 s I enjoyed this movie it s plot and all the actors I recently purchased this movie on DVD so when I have kids of my own they will be able to have as much fun watching this movie as I did The plot is fun A group of kids embark on a journey they never expected when they were rocketed into space by a overachieving robot They were in auh at first but when they realized they didn t have enough oxygen to make it back panic sunk in Once they recovered enough oxygen from the space station they returned to earth as even better friends and a new found respect for life
I ve been reading through some of the other user comments and decided to put one in too Some of the users are stuck in a realist type of mentality This film was meant to be a fantasy a what if fun film It was never meant to be real or serious It was thoroughly enjoyable for everyone I knew when it came out even though it shadowed the tragedy of the Challenger explosion I was 30 at the time and totally enjoyed this one my young son loved it too Later I shared it with my daughter and she too loved it SpaceCamp is a fun family film that should be enjoyed for just that fun All the realists in the world should lighten up or stick to watching documentaries or docudramas and avoid any other type of film So sorry for those young folks who watched this movie first and then were able to go to the real SpaceCamp one in Alabama and one at Vandenberg AFB in California they must have gone expecting to find the same type of environment that was portrayed in the movie and then felt letdown I guess their parents didn t explain the difference between fantasy and reality Oh well If you love fantasy fun films and haven t seen this one I highly recommend it Enjoy
This is one of those feel good Saturday afternoon movies It s right up there with other retro flicks like Flight of the Navigator Just a cute movie with some subtle comedy to lighten things up And it s fun to see how 20 years has changed the stars like Kelly Preston and Lea Thompson Not to mention Joquin Phoenix br br I personally really like movies like this from time to time Nothing too deep or too scary Just a nice story line And I would have never known Mr Phoenix had I not recently read the credits He was just a baby really when he made this movie br br Kelly Preston was quite the young budding actress then too She and Lea did a wonderful job in this movie I agree it s not an Oscar caliber movie But very much worth watching Especially if you have kids in the let s say 8 to 11 year old range Or ones that are interested in the space program
Space Camp is a pretty decent film The plot is predictable but the actors do a good job and the special effects are decent for the time br br This film was originally released about the time of the shuttle disaster and that really put a hamper on how popular it was br br The scene where the shuttle doors open in space is simply spectacular on the big screen that is on a TV it just looks average I remember this scene in the theater It made you feel like you were really up there br br This would be a good film to see on IMAX but I m sure that will never happen
To my surprise I quite enjoyed Spacecamp i remember seeing it about 13 years ago and recently I hired it again I was quite impressed Obviously the special effects in todays space films such as Armageddon and Deep Impact are far superior to those in SpaceCamp However this film had a story a very stereotypical eighties story where you could almost recite the next line of dialogue before hearing it But thats what I liked about it they don t make films like this anymore so it was a refreshing change It was interesting to see Kelly Preston Leaf Phoenix and Lea Thomson in early roles with Tom Skerrit and Kate Capshaw to add substance to the light fluffy plot Absolutely loved the robot named Jinx it was very cute but it unfortunately had more emotion than some of the main characters The film was almost inspirational in its own way and it was interesting to note that it was filmed at the NASA Spacecamp in Alabama i think
This is a family film which to some people is an automatic turn off It seems that too many people do not want to see films that are not loaded down with failing arms and legs gratuitous violence and enough expletives to fill the New York phone book This film is none of those It is clich√© it is formula but it is also fun It doesn t ask you to think it doesn t demand that you accept the film as reality It simply does what a good film ought to do which is to willingly suspend disbelief for two hours and enjoy the adventure The cast is good while not excellent As another commenter pointed out the John Williams sound score was as usual excellent And the fact that a lot of the film was shot in Huntsville at the real space camp made it even more believable br br It was ironic that the original release of the film was delayed for some months due to the Challenger Shuttle disaster which may have played a large part in it s original theatrical opening but the film eventually has helped to focus the dreams of many young people back towards space and the possibilities that lie therein SO sit back with your kids and prepare to enjoy
The perfect space fantasy film a group of kids go up accidentally in space and have to get back down but do they sure they do This would not be a family film if they all died Then it will all be sad You don t want that Kate Capsaw the leading lady gives a Golden Globe performance but sadly she nor Lea Thompson won one That sucks so bad I can t say it enough this film is so great Lea Thompson o lord a perfect girl for this film This film is the best for sure br br Sorry but better than Star Wars Star Wars is so over rated and space camp was so under rated It should of been the other way around br br excellent 10 10 0r maybe 11 10 Iam not good at math
A few summer space campers actually were accidently sent into space by a robot And the oxygen in ship was running short They had to sent someone to a space station to get the gas tanks etc etc br br First of all this movie s plot is not possible in real life But it gives a warm feelings of anything is possible if you set your heart in br br It is amazing to see those young actors who still look about the same after so many years I saw this movie for the first time in the year of 2000 it was filmed in 1986 There are quite a few people in that movie who are still working in Hollywood br br The view was great from outer space It does not look unreal It is about 2 hours long it runs so fast that you won t even notice You know that it is not real but you just get sucked into it until the end br br Overall it is a good family movie br br
Unfortunately SpaceCamp came out about the same time as the Challenger Explosion Which really put a crimp on when to bring it out or even if they should bring it out I m glad they did I first watched SpaceCamp at a drive in movie Which really enhanced the viewing a lot br br While I had heard of Lea Thompson and Tom Skerritt I had never heard of the others in the movie So it came as a big shock to me to find all those youngsters acting and acting real good Of course Kate Capshaw was excellent too br br I especially liked the scenes where those kids were being shown how to act as a team The scenes of the kids being prepared for a trip they could only hope for The actual launch of a spacecraft is of course old news to us However this one was different br br All in all this is one of my most treasured films Escapist maybe but it was fantastic for a space nut like me After probably renting it for 30 40 times I finally found it available in a certain store and bought it Now if it only comes out on DVD I will probably have it forever This movie gets a 9 out of 10 from me
I notice the DVD version seems to have missing scenes or lines between the posting of the FRF and the launch br br They are to prove they can win the right to sit in the FRF other than the green team br br Another scene is like during their failure at the simulation Kevin gets Joaquin to clam down br br I think the VHS edition other than the ABC one might have all the missing stuff br br Otherwise I like to know which DVD release has the missing stuff br br The DVD I have watched feels edited for television
I could see this film is super He didn t surprise to oneself when so that it was taking place for the truth this way by itself how swigged flight to the which didn t have the place but it is only such an conspiratorial theory Right br br Very I liked watching this film when I was the child I am interesting which so that it was if it turned out that such a flight was taking place really certainly to it for not a belief because it is denying logic and the common sense Who at healthy senses sent to kids with space shuttle into the orbit I very like reading for the subject American and Soviet space programs I know a few missions of space shuttles remained provided by CIA with the clause TOP SECRET certainly these are only such my divagations but who knows
Watching this movie again really brought back some great childhood memories I m 34 now have not seen it since I was 12 14 I had almost forgotten about this movie but when I watched it again recently some scenes literally brought a tear to my eye That little robot Jinx friends for ever It was just like revisiting my childhood It was an absolutely amazing experience for me I will always cherish this movie for that reason I hope some of you readers can relate to my experience not for this particular movie but any movie you have not seen in a long while Very nostalgic br br Thanks for reading
WOW br br This film is the best living testament I think of what happened on 9 11 01 in NYC compared to anything shown by the major media outlets br br Those outlets can only show you what happened on the outside This film shows you what happened on the INSIDE br br It begins with a focus on a rookie New York fireman waiting for weeks for the first big fire that he will be called to fight The subject matter turns abruptly with the ONLY EXISTING FOOTAGE OF THE FIRST PLANE TO HIT THE TOWERS You are then given a front row seat as firefighters rush to the scene into the lobby of Tower One br br In the minutes that precede the crash of the second plane and Tower Two s subsequent fall you see firemen reacting to the unsettling sound of people landing above the lobby It is a sight you will not soon forget br br Heart rending tear jerking and very compelling from the first minute to the last 9 11 deserves to go down in history as one of the best documentary films ever made br br We must never forget br br
When this first came out 6 months after the tragedy I didn t want to see it I didn t want to open old wounds I regretted it Now I have seen the movie Thank God I did It shows you the bravery of all the FDNY and NYPD I salute you It offered me closure I can now move on with my life
These two men went thru hell and beyond and have produced the movie that conveys the terror that many did not survive This is definitely a movie about survival but not without it s touching moments br br The finest piece of work I have seen documenting the 9 11 01 tragedy of New York City
If I didn t know any better it almost seems like it was staged but it wasn t It was set up perfectly and how they got all of that footage is amazing The unfortunate events of September 11 2001 are put together well in this documentary and the classic footage that they got made this an unfortunate classic Just the history in the footage alone should make it a MUST see for any american or person touched by the tragedy of September 11
SPOILERS 9 11 is a very good and VERY realistic documentary about the attacks on the WTC 2 French film makers who are in New York to film the actions of a NYFD are being confronted with this event and make the most of it Before 9 11 nothing much really happens which gives the movie an even more horror like scenario On the day of the attacks it seems like just another dull day at work but this will soon change As one the film makers goes on the road with the firemen he films the first crashing plane this is the only footage of the first impact He rides with the firemen to the WTC and goes inside the building As the second plane crashes the people understand that this is not an accident In the next period of time we see firemen making plans to save as many people as possible in the meanwhile we hear banging sounds these are the sounds of people who jumped down from the tower and falling on the ground this is the most grueling moment in the documentary Then the tower collapses and our French friend has to run for his life you hear him breath like a madman while he runs out of the building Then a huge sort of sandstorm blasts over him and the screen turns black he was very lucky to survive and now he can film the empty streets of Downtown New York Because this documentary has got so much historical footage and because the film was ment to be something totally different this documentary will probably stay in everybody s memory I saw the attacks live at home because I had the afternoon of so this makes it even more realistic to watch 10 10
Amazing documentary Saw it on original airdate and on DVD a few times in the last few years I was shocked that it wasn t even nominated for a Best Documentary Oscar for 2002 the year it was released No other documentary even comes close br br It was on TV recently for the 5th anniversary but I missed the added where are they now segment at the end except I did catch that tony now works for the hazmat unit br br I ve seen criticism on documentary film making from a few on this list I can t see how this could have been done any different They had less than 6 months to assemble this and get it on the air The DVD contains more material and background br br I m also surprised that according to IMDb com the brother have had no projects in the four years since What have they been doing
Made by french brothers Jules and Giddeon Naudet and narrated by Robert De Niro and Firefighter James Hanlon this is a compelling and heartbreaking tale of how New York s finest shone on it s darkest day I first saw this when I was a young naive 12 year old and at that age it still touched me Knowing how serious 9 11 really was seeing this expanded the whole effect of 9 11 We were finding out who the heroes were how there everyday lives were composed and how they put their lives on the line in a situation where most people would just run and save their selves These brave men put their lives on the line and watching this just increases my admiration for them Watch if you can this is the best documentary I have personally ever seen
The French Naudet brothers did something nobody else did they had a video camera the day that this tragedy happened They were in Building 2 when you could see papers drifting down people hitting the ground from jumping from such a height br br I mean it goes as far as when both buildings collapsed they went running their camera was still running when the white dust covered them they found a shop doorway and got inside but all this footage is real and I think they did a fantastic job of capturing it for us br br Ten stars goes to the Naudet brothers that filmed this extraordinary film that I watch every 9 11 so I ll never forget what this country went through I believe if I remember right it shows the first death of the priest of the firefighters while he was being carried to the church and his honorable funeral
Difficult film to comment on how do you say it s bad Well it isn t but then it s equally difficult to say it is good What it is is compelling viewing it is as close as you will get to utter devastation without being there It is the photographs of the tsunami approaching the coast of Thailand brought to life you know you want to turn away but you have to watch br br The Naudet brothers handle the commentary very well even in the most tragic of circumstances there view on something which is happening in another country neither panders nor insults The facts are on the cellulose and little is needed for the viewer to understand or comprehend what is going on br br You can t change history and you should not want this film stands as a testament to humanity in its darkest hour
I ve read most of the comments here I came to the conclusion that almost everybody agrees that 9 11 is a shocking piece of history There are a few who think that the added narrative is weak and br br I agree that the narrative is weak and unnecessary About two brothers finding each other back after the disaster and the cliff hanger about Tony But I don t think narration is unnecessary Like I lot of theorists I think that our own lives are narrations We are living and making our own autobiography So if we tell about our lives this is always in the form of narration We don t sum up facts like Birth Childhood High School etc We create a story about our live br br Because we are familiar with stories we want to put history in a story as well Because in the form of a story we can identify ourselves We can better understand the things happened in history when its told in the form of a story So that s the purpose of adding a story in documentary The story is weak so be it but we understand whats going on If it was me out there I would be worried sick about my brother br br And the second point making a blockbuster movie about it True it s been to recent to come up with a big movie about 9 11 Though there have been a few about the subject but none of them like this documentary But what if there will be a movie in about 5 years I agree it is wrong trying to make a lot of money out of 9 11 But I also agree that movies are one of the best way to tell history How many movies about the World war 2 have we seen If I had not seen these movies my view of the WW would me totally different I remember seeing Schindlers List and I cried for an hour during class Movies give you a good image of the things that happened in history and although it is fiction it contributes to the memory of the disasters and the casualties br br So my point telling stories is not always bad it makes us identify with the story and makes us never forget what happened
The events of September 11 2001 do not need extra human interest in the shape of following the training of the rookie fireman or the progress of the two French brothers In my view it would have been better to leave this out I think the directors tried too hard perhaps they felt that the events of the day needed a story as a backdrop The comment of one of a policemen this aint f ing Disneyworld is apt br br Nevertheless it is compelling viewing for the depiction of the events The filmakers were in all the right places at the right times no other footage from the day matches what they shot
Let me get the bad out of the way first James Hanlon is absolutely terrible trying to act his descriptions of what was going on with the rookie training and events of the day Really it is in stark contract to the other fire fighters without acting aspirations who are natural in their delivery br br That said it is an amazing film that is impossible to watch without tears in my eyes I am an English guy from London but I love New York and have visited many many times before and after September 11th It is a second home to me and I can t help but feel devastated at the loss of life but also the destruction of part of such an amazing beautiful city This is the real deal in with the fire fighters with everything collapsing around them I am so glad the footage exists to show people how it was on the day It is a shame that they didn t use any footage of people jumping from the buildings because friends who were there tell me this is such a major part of their memory it should be included to show future generations just how terrible it really was br br Conspiracy theorists can go to hell by the way
I live in Missouri so the direct effects of terrorism are largely unknown to me this brought it home That two men would put themselves on the line in the way that those members of FDNY and NYPD did just to document the horror that unfolded on that day This film is a testament to those who lost their lives and the true evil that terror brings
G√©d√©on and Jules Naudet wanted to film a documentary about rookie New York City firefighters What they got was the only film footage inside the World Trade Center on September 11 br br Having worked with James Hanlon s ladder company before Jules went with the captain to inspect and repair a gas leak while G√©d√©on stayed at the firehouse in case anything interesting happened An airplane flying low over the City distracted Jules and he pointed the camera up seconds before the plane crashed into Tower One br br Jules asked the captain to follow him into the Towers The first thing he saw was two people on fire something he refused to film He stayed on site for the next several hours filming reactions of the firefighters and others who were there br br The brothers Naudet took great care in not making the movie too violent grizzly and gory But the language from the firefighters is a little coarse and CBS showed a lot of balls airing it uncensored The brothers Naudet mixed footage they filmed with one on one interviews so the firefighters could explain their thoughts and emotions during particular moments of the crisis br br Unlike a feature film of similar title most of the money from DVD sales go to 9 11 related charities Very well made emotional moving and completely devoid of political propaganda is the best documentary of the sort to date
I have to say that the events of 9 11 didn t hit me until I saw this documentary It took me a year to come to grips with the devastation I was the one who was changing the station on the radio and channel on TV if there was any talk about the towers I was sick of hearing about it When this was aired on TV a year and a day later I was bawling my eyes out It was the first time I had cried since the attack I highly recommend this documentary I am watching it now on TV 5 years later and I am still crying over the tragedies The fact that this contains one of the only video shots of the first plane hitting the tower is amazing It was an accident and look where it got them These two brothers make me want to have been there to help
I rented this for my son who is recently found interest in 9 11 He was a Kindergartener at the time and had no idea what was unfolding I liked the way it was told as a documentary If there was one movie that I would recommend to see concerning 9 11 this would be THE one Normally you see a movie it has actors that are well known This movie had nobody known Also you see a movie concerning 9 11 you hear about a fire fighter or two losing their lives saving people I didn t feel this had any of that I only rented this movie and would definitely consider adding it to my collection Very well done indeed My heart goes out to the survivors and families of victims of 9 11
Incredible documentary captured all the frenzied chaos and misery which loomed over NYC on that fateful morning of September 11th Intense personal and completely riveting 9 11 is perhaps the greatest documentary ever made by accident which kind of gives it an even greater appeal Up until that morning filmmakers Gideon and Jules Naudet had been following around a New York firefighter team concentrating specifically on one new recruit in a little piece they were shooting dealing with the rigorous training to become a fireman Out with the team that morning filming yet another simple routine cleanup Jules lifts his camera up to the sky just in time to record one of the only known images of the first plane hitting the World Trade Center and from there a simple documentary was no more br br Viewers are given a first hand account of what it was like to be in and around ground zero as the amazing group of fire fighters and one profoundly bewildered cameraman attempt to navigate this disaster Without hesitation Naudet follows these automatically programmed heroes into the tower while it s entire support crumbles around them The raw fear of an unknown impending doom lurks with more viability then any fictional production could ever fathom as we watch less and less become audible and visible for those trapped inside Nearly as memorable is older brother Gideon s candid capturing of an entire city in the throngs of a larger and more palpable fear then anything they had collectively witnessed By the time we get to see the second tower collapse as the cameraman shields himself from apocalyptic debris we should all but be rinsing the dirt off ourselves from the amazingly up close footage captured br br Obviously the filmmakers deserve only as much credit as being in the right place at the right time to document such an extraordinary event though one can only admire the two brothers in their extraordinary adaptation to such an event in a few desperate minutes we witness them become like the firemen they document only instead of saving lives they knew they had to save footage even if it cost them their own safety br br After viewing 9 11 and seeing that it came out in 2002 I feel much more resentment towards Oliver Stone s recent rendition the big budgeted World Trade Center Many had criticized the film for ignorantly narrowing down the focus to those two survivors trapped in rubble and although I enjoyed the movie just fine for the small and sentimental Hollywood focus it brought 9 11 all but renders his film completely obsolete Not only will this utterly gripping footage remain the only definitive collection from that day but the sublime transfer of motives midway ensures that this documentary has all the heart and character needed to never sensationalize the event again
To sum this documentary up in a few words is next to impossible Every fiber of your body tells you that this is not happening right from the opening montage of rapid fire images through to the last shot of the clean up at Ground Zero but every frame is real The story was thought up by two French brothers living in New York Jules 28 and Gideon 31 Naudet pronounced Nau day want to make a documentary on New York City Firefighters beginning with a newbie from the academy and follow him through the nine month probationary period to full fledged firefighter Seeking the help of their close friend actor James Hanlon 36 an actor and firefighter at Station 1 Engine 7 the Naudets sift through the Probies at the academy and find one Tony Benetakos to focus the bulk of their documentary on br br Tony becomes the butt of jokes and slowly learns the ins and outs of station life through the members of this close knit family Firefighters have a superstition about Probies It is that they are either White Clouds or Black Clouds meaning that with the latter all kinds of fires follow the Probie The former means that very little fire activity follows but one day there will be the mother of all fires Tony is a White Cloud After some initial growing pains Tony settles into the firehouse as if he were a seasoned vet Then the unthinkable occurs br br September 11 2001 begins with a clear blue sky and an early morning call to go and see about a supposed gas leak not far from Wall Street Because Jules has had little camera experience Gideon hands a camera to his younger brother and tells him to ride with the chief T K Pfeiffer Arriving at about 8 42 the firefighters begin to use their gas detectors over a grate Then the sudden roar of what seems to be a low flying airplane rips past the scene and as Jules pans upwards we see the first strike of the day American Airlines Flight 11 smashes into the face of the North Tower of 1 World Trade Pfeiffer orders his men into the fire engine and they head for the World Trade Center Once there Jules asks to accompany the Chief into the tower Pfeiffer tells Naudet to stick close to him Once inside the full impact of the growing disaster begins to show on the faces of the men whose sole purpose is to save lives br br Gideon Naudet decides to leave the firehouse and walk down to the impact area Once there he captures the impact of the second plane United Airlines Flight 175 with 2 World Trade He knows Jules is with Chief Pfeiffer inside the towers Watching and capturing the crowds reaction to the unimaginable Gideon begins to capture on tape the growing fear in Lower Manhattan Inside tower one Jules records the last view the world or loved ones will have of their sons fathers uncles grandfathers husbands boyfriends friends as one by one each firefighter carrying 60 lbs of equipment begin the long arduous climb up 80 stories to rescue the injured and trapped Jules also catches the last glimpse Chief Pfeiffer will have of his brother Kevin as he leaves to do his selfless duty Also caught on video is the gutwrenching sound of falling bodies hitting pavement from victims choosing to jump from the higher floors above the impact zones sooner than face death at the hands of the flames and smoke But Jules is respectful never once does he capture a sensationalistic moment the money shot His work is professional through his baptism of fire He also catches the sight of debris falling from tower two after it is hit by the second plane and the ordered way the firefighters evacuated civilians from the building Then Jules is caught in the collapse of the south tower and the first official victim is taken Father Michael Judd the Chaplain for the fire department Then as Jules and Chief Pfeiffer make their way from the fallout of the collapse of tower two tower one begins its structural collapse br br What results is a breathtakingly poignant view from inside Ground Zero as Jules and Gideon work separately to document that day Not knowing if either is alive each fearing the worst As each firefighter arrives at the firehouse they greet each other with joyous hugs at having made it back And in one moment of overwhelming emotion Jules and Gideon are reunited As Jules cries on his brother s shoulder Gideon embraces his younger brother as Hanlon makes the filmmakers the subject There is one fearful moment when Tony Benetakos who left the station with a former chief is believed to have been lost but returns to the fold this Probie has proven himself br br Shown with only three interruptions 9 11 is a stunning achievement in documentary filmmaking It ranks up there with the Hindenburg footage in showing history as it unfolds The Naudets are to be commended for their deft handling of the subject In lesser hands the tendency would be toward the sensational but the Naudets temper their eye toward dignity and compassion Narrated by Hanlon we get the feel of his words as he takes the audience through the events of September 11 Robert De Niro hosts the program in a sombre restrained way He never seeks the camera for his own glory rather he lays out the scenes you are about to see I also commend CBS for their bravery at airing this special Chastised for their attempt at grabbing ratings they temper their editing toward the emotions of the relatives of those who perished This is a must see for anyone who needs to be reminded of what true heroism is It isn t about dribbling a basketball or selling an album of hate lyrics 9 11 is about humanity at its best Heroism at its finest and the cost of freedom br br
This was the most visually stunning moving amazing and incredible story I ve ever experienced Quite frankly even those adjectives just cannot describe it I can t just choose one scene that stood out for me I suppose if I had to list a few it would be the reactions of the fireman to the crashing sound of jumping victims the reaction of people trapped in the elevator who were unaware of what was going on as they finally emerge to the horrific scene the shock and disbelief of the onlookers and finally the silence br br On that day and even now I am reminded of Star Wars 1977 Obi Wan says I felt a great disturbance in the Force as if millions of voices suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced It is amazing how it is so accurate in its description There was truly a disturbance in the Force br br This documentary vividly reveals this disturbance The feelings are so incredibly visual The anger the frustration the shock the fear the exhaustion and the realization of its very magnitude It s all there Not a thing is missed br br This is a powerful and most moving documentary and well deserving of the Emmy Not just because it documents 9 11 but because it is simply everything it should be br br If you plan to watch be sure to grab a box of tissues You ll need them I know that I did
To those who say that this movie deserves anything below the unflaunting grace that it showed I disagree This is an amazing documentary about a shocking day br br IMDB asks us to rate this movie I beg you to consider the fact that the documentary was made The courage that it took to shoot this film is most notable We find that the two brothers are split up when that moment happened They continue to document the bravest of the brave without knowing about their own and eachother s safety To judge whether it s nobler to shoot a video of that tragedy or to save the lives as those amazing amazing firefighters did is not mine to answer I just know that in 30 years a class full of children will not know one without the other br br I submit a wholehearted 10 This is why the art of filming was created To capture the natural emotion that real life offers You can keep your kung fu junk Romance is cute Action will never reach this level This movie 9 11 will be timeless in that it did not glorify itself It didn t have a sneak peek It didn t have all of the blatant vanities that a lion s share of the many movies on the many screens blare It had class composure substance and it had a record of the day that changed the modern face of America and even the world It spoke of things inescapable to the eye of the camera Please consider this movie as it itself proclaims a stirring tribute to all of those who fell because of the free beautiful name of America br br How can you give anything less to a movie that shows not embellishes the natural bravery of real people acting in unreal times I love The Godfather but 9 11 is forever a different kind of movie as this is now a different kind of world It is art without question or questions br br jf
I was a little skepticle if I should watch this when it was first shown on CBS I was one of the many people who were in NYC on that day I was going to school at Hunter College I didnt want to see all the devistation and carnage again but like many I was curious to see what this was all about Tears came to my eyes watching this documentary All my memories returned and just the intense images were unbelievable I bought the DVD on the one year anniversary and watched it a few times How these guys were able to capture this footage was incredible If you have not seen this documentary do yourself a favor and check it out It is obviously depressing and will bring tears to eyes but it s an incredible document of this countries darkest hour
Great documentary about the lives of NY firefighters during the worst terrorist attack of all time That reason alone is why this should be a must see collectors item What shocked me was not only the attacks but the High Fat Diet and physical appearance of some of these firefighters I think a lot of Doctors would agree with me that in the physical shape they were in some of these firefighters would NOT of made it to the 79th floor carrying over 60 lbs of gear Having said that i now have a greater respect for firefighters and i realize becoming a firefighter is a life altering job The French have a history of making great documentary s and that is what this is a Great Documentary
Very interesting and moving documentary about the World Trade Center tragedy on 11th September 2001 The main theme of it is the heroism of American fire fighters who tried to rescue as many people as they could The film is deeply emotional and rather disturbing many people seen on screen have lost their lives Recommended
Warning Mild Spoilers Ahead br br Yes I realize it s tough to spoil an historical documentary but I do reveal some of the backstory and methods br br This is an exceptional documentary not just because of the remarkable footage but also due to the story behind it Because the Naudets did not set out to tell the story of 9 11 but rather that of a rookie firefighter the men s emotions and the viewer s connection with them are more real and powerful than they would be in a standard retrospective br br In a filmmaking sense 9 11 is textbook If the events were an actual script they would be superb as the characters are established then thrown a curve to which they must react This is all the more amazing considering the pain and emotion of the raw footage that the directors had to wade through to piece this story together br br The first portion of the film provides a glimpse of life inside a fire station specifically how a rookie assimilates himself into a crew of veterans That part alone is quite good and had the documentary been allowed to run its intended course it probably would have been solid The brothers appear to realistically portray the process of becoming a NYC firefighter br br Then of course all hell breaks loose The chaos following the WTC attacks is vividly seen as various characters that we have gotten to know are thrust into terrifying situations Seeing not only the attacks but also the first hand reactions is a very moving picture of extreme human emotion br br The aftermath in which firefighters are discovered to be lost and found is human drama at its peak Life and death hang in the balance Unlike many movies the viewer not only doesn t know who will live and die but genuinely cares about them br br The only negative thing I have to say about this is that the Robert DeNiro whom I like blurbs were uninformative unnecessary and didn t advance the story at all They were probably added just to attract more television viewers br br Bottom Line The best documentary I ve ever seen Nonpareil portrayals of raw human emotion and drama 9 5 out of 10
9 11 is a classic example of cinema verite a sort of realist documentary in this case of New York firemen as they battle against one of the most extraordinary events of world history It s all tiny unobtrusive hand held video cameras often betrayed by the poor quality of most of the filming and by the director Naudet s hand frequently wiping the screen br br In this film you get to know most of the firemen Tony Benatatos the rookie or probie in NY fireman vernacular the Fire Chief Joseph Pfeiffer who finds he s lost his brother later on and a few others There are studio interviews with most of these people throughout the film just to emphasise the personal reflexive nature of the events The build up is quite dramatic and well done particularly the passing out ceremony at the Fire Department with a few useful swish pans and a sort of dialectical editing of the rather limited filmwork just like Rob Reiner s A Few Good Men Tony looks proud br br The viewpoint and camera angle is usually from amidst the firemen which is interesting and there is some excellent footage from inside the lobby of WTC1 while Pfeiffer and his team plan what to do next this is classic cinema verite There is also the eery haunting sound of the occasional human body crashing against the portico outside It is then that an increasingly forlorn Fire Chief Pfeiffer realises that his task is desperate and probably hopeless and this is before WTC2 collapses You have to give credit to Naudet for knowing which faces to film and at which moment br br The sound of the neighbouring WTC2 collapsing is so awfully sad poignant and terrifying that you realise what an ordeal this is for the firemen From the lobby it looks feels and sounds like the end of the world and the poor firemen look so utterly bewildered and frightened You hear an enormous rumbling trembling maelstrom like that of a giant monolithic beast slowly falling to the ground after being so mortally wounded the neighbouring tower has collapsed yet the fire team remaining in WTC1 are oblivious to this event Where is the communication br br This film is captivating yet the narration is amateurish and should have been avoided cues like this really was a day like no other or Naudet s frequently banal pronouncements like you could see fear in everybody s eyes and I knew Tony was freaking out The film is really just one long video diary There are no pictures from higher up the building where some of the firemen have gone Imagine this film blended with CCTV footage from some of the rooms higher up or some of the news coverage from the day The effect would be greater You could even combine this story with that of Mayor Giuliani and perhaps the famous Cornishman Rick Riscorla who literally was many floors up acting the hero br br I don t see much of a propaganda element in this film as some reviewers suggest This film is no Triumph of the Will by Riefenstahl Some time later the firemen drape the American flag over a nearby surviving building overlooking what has become Ground Zero So what br br There are also some moments of dubious camerawork for example who is holding the camera when the two Naudet brothers are reunited back at the fire station Is it staged br br There is an excellent finish very much in the traditon of the excellent French director Alain Resnais Hiroshima mon amour with two strips of light reflected in the water shimmying
It s true that you always remember what you were doing at a point when disaster or tragedy strikes And none more so that September 11 2001 a date which changed the entire global landscape in its fight against terrorism br br No this documentary didn t set out to be dwelling on the events leading to 9 11 Rather the filmmakers brothers G√©d√©on and Jules Naudet set out to do a documentary on the trials and tribulations of a rookie New York firefighter They had gone to the academy and done some shoots of training and had handpicked their proby probation firefighter to join them in an NY firehouse home to Ladder 1 and Engine 7 But their production was to develop and contain at that time believed to be the only shot of the first plane slamming into the World Trace Center br br I was traveling back with a friend on the train from a night of LAN gaming and received a call at about 850pm local time from my Dad who informed me of the above Few minutes later he told me there was another and that the WTC was under attack By the time I arrived home the upper floors of the twin towers were ablaze and in smoke and to my horror they collapsed under an hour br br The filmmakers had two cameras running that day one who had followed a team out on a routine call and which immediately raced to the WTC upon hearing and seeing the plane crash into it We follow what is possible the only filmed sequence of events in the lobby of WTC1 where the first responders of firefighters paramedics and police had to make sense of what happened and to quickly develop a plan of action The other camera held by the other brother was making his way to WTC to look for his sibling and along the journey captured the many expressions of New Yorkers as well as the sense of chaos in and around Manhatten br br Peppered throughout the documentary are numerous interviews with the men from Ladder 1 and Engine 7 which miraculously did not suffer any casualty But being survivors also brought about its own set of psychological turmoil as they struggle to come to terms with the event Through the events that unfold we learn of the strong camaraderie amongst these men who risk live and limb each day on their jobs to save lives br br We began with what the documentary was supposed to be before events of the day totally swung in and became the focus right up to the rescue phase where hopes of finding survivors under the rubble were kept alive by the men who work round the clock in making sense of the collapsed steel structures It s not a film that is fabricated and what you see here cannot be recreated in any other documentary and heavens not sound stages for Hollywood blockbusters It s as close as you can get to that day witnessing the event up close from safety br br Code 1 DVD contains a separate extra hour of 4 sets of interviews with the men of Ladder 1 and Engine 7
9 11 hosted by Robert DeNiro presents footage from outside and inside the Twin Towers in New York on September 11 2001 br br Never too grisly and gory yet powerful and moving 9 11 is a real treat Anyone not moved by this television show is immune to anything br br 5 5 stars br br
My roommate had bought this documentary and invited me to watch it with her She s from China and only heard so much about 9 11 and wanted to know the cold hard truth and she wanted me to tell her more after the documentary I felt awful watching this documentary it was like reliving the nightmare and it still brings tears to my eyes br br But I m extremely grateful that I watched this documentary because on the day of September 11th I m sure we all remember where we were and what we were doing when we heard all of us could only think certain questions Why How What s going on Oh my God Almost all the Americans were grateful for the brave firemen and policemen that risked their lives to save others But I don t think we thought about what they were really going though This wasn t actually supposed to be a documentary about 9 11 the cameraman was just filming a typical day on the job and they just happened to be a couple blocks away from the World Trade Centers and got everything outside and in on tape br br On Sep 11th I thought to myself It s OK the policemen and firemen will get the people out that survived To be honest I thought it was an accident I was in my junior year of high school and getting changed from gym and getting ready to go to my science class Someone came into the locker room shouting Some building just got bombed in New York we all got dressed quickly and ran to our classrooms as we watched the first tower burning on TV Not only 15 seconds later live on TV does the second plane crash into the other World Trade Center and we knew this was no accident A few minutes later we heard about the Pentagon and that there was a plane headed for Chicago but was shot down So many thoughts ran through our heads and I kept on thinking What are the firemen and policemen going to do But it s procedure to them I thought they ll know what to do br br The first tower collapsed we knew it so many lives are now gone the second tower crashed things would never be the same Those firemen in this documentary showed courage confusion and strength the real raw human emotions They didn t know what to do they were just as scarred as those other people who were in the towers They heard the bodies collapsing on the ground from people jumping out the windows And here I was in a classroom just crying seeing all that was going on on TV I was amazed with this film and just wanted to go to New York and tell them how grateful all the Americans were for their help I know they feel like they were just doing their job but they did more they were hero s Every day after Sep 11th for 3 weeks they kept on digging knowing that there were no survivors but they kept on hoping and praying May God bless their kind and brave hearts br br As for my roommate she was crying and admitted this was her first time crying at these attacks She got to see the truth of what had happened that tragic day She asked Why I didn t know what to say it breaks my heart that people can be that evil It sounds clique but it was a normal day for everyone one of the firemen said in the documentary No one expected this to happen Not like that those people in the World Trade Centers or the Pentagon or the planes that were hijacked they were just doing their job happen to be there or even just was there for a second passing by They were not just murdered they were slaughtered and those hijackers did it with a song in their heart Then seeing in the middle east all the people celebrating why do people do this They celebrated death and the lose of mothers fathers sisters brothers friends grandparents aunts uncles cousins etc Why br br So thanks to those people for making this documentary You truly think about the firemen policemen and the troops in Iraq and it keeps your hope up that there are good people in this world Thank you to all those people you are our heroes br br 10 10
I was one of many that expected to see a glorified Yankee doodle dandy portrayal of a day that as famously quoted should live in infamy rather than glory How wrong I was These guys were there right in the middle of it and the pictures they returned are both amazing and heartbreaking And yet it all occurred on a chance trip to the world trade centre on September 11 2001 br br Two French filmmakers were compiling a documentary about life as a NY firefighter particularly from the perspective of a young rookie coming up through the ranks At the beginning we see much of this footage just to remind us that there was no thought to producing a film about terrorism This was intended to be a film about regular people earning an honest living helping others and the beauty of the film is that it never loses this edge br br While investigating a suspect gas line I think my memory s a little hazy on that we suddenly hear a plane fly overhead The camera pans up to reveal a commercial jet torpedoing itself into one of the towers What must the cameraman have been thinking at this time Recognising the importance of the footage the camera stays on and possibly realizing the same thing the FDNY allow the camera to follow them into the building br br What follows is a true view from the front lines We see the commitment of the FDNY their reactions the stunned silence after hearing the first person fall to their death is chilling as well as the collapse of the one of the buildings from the inside while a second camera captures the events from the outside br br If it wasn t for the horrific event they were covering the footage alone would be any young doco maker s dream come true Quite simply the footage deserves to be preserved for all time But what really sets this film apart is the genuine humanity that it brings to the viewer We see firefighters charging in without hesitation people of different races helping one another escape to wave of rubble and even the concern of the filmmakers for one another they are brothers as they cannot reach one another in the confusion There are amazing sights as well as amazing human stories in this film something Hollywood could never duplicate even though it s trying br br 9 11 isn t a film about politics Nor is it a film about religion nationality or even jihad for that matter 9 11 is a film about people and a true indication of the best and worst that we are capable of 9 11 is quite simply one of the most important films I ve ever seen and would be the only film to be born from this event if it were up to me You can t duplicate this
I must admit that I was very sceptical about this documentary I was expecting it to be the kind of All American Propaganda that we here in Europe dislike so much I was wrong This is NOT propaganda in fact it is hardly political at all br br It depicts the events of 9 11 through the eyes of the firefighters called to the scene just after the planes crashed It is an amazing coinsidence that this documentary was filmed at all This film was initially shot as a documnetary about a rookie NY firefighter becoming a man We can only thank the film makers that they continued their work during the terrible ordeal that faced them br br A great piece of work Absolutely stunning material Highly recommended br br Regards
It s a good movie maybe I like it because it was filmed here in PR The actors did a good performance and not only did the girls be girlish but they were good in fighting so it was awsome The guy is cute too so it s a good match if you want to the guy or the girls
Yowsa If you REALLY want some ACTION check out the babes and bombs on this non stop thriller Veteran star MARTIN SHEEN leads a trio of supermodels on a mission to stop nuclear terrorism but director Dean Hamilton doesn t let this heavy plotline get in the way of massive doses of TEENSY SWIMSUIT scenes jiggly beach jogs hubba hubba hot tubs and the like Want action You ll get more of it here than in PEARL HARBOR Want babes You ll get an eyeful every two minutes Want more Go out and BUY THIS VIDEO Yowsa Yowsa Yowsa That s some mighty spicy meatballs
A thin story with many fine shots Eyecatchers here are the three ladies from the D R E A M team And to a lesser extent the guy accompanying them Traci Lords convincingly acts out the female half of an evil business couple intending to poison the world with antrax Original in this movie is the bra bomb put on a captured member of the D R E A M team Of course she is rescued by a co member three seconds before explosion Although clearly lent from James Bond s Goldfinger and You only live twice such a climax always works well All in all a nice watch James Bond replaced here by three Charlie s Angels
Of course I would have to give this film 10 out of 10 as my uncle was the main screenplay writer of Once upon a Crime Rodolfo Sonego wrote screenplays for over 50 years living in Italy He was a great story teller and someone suggested that he put his stories into writing So Rodolfo Sonego did If you check out his biography you can see the number of movies that have been made in Italy Alberto Sordie was the main actor that starred in his stories My uncle visited Australia and my town in 1968 to check out locations for A girl in Australia and created a great movie about a proxy bride after the second world war You can see his humor in all his movies I found a copy of this movie on DVD recently GREAT
I saw this ages ago when I was younger and could never remember the title until one day I was scrolling through John Candy s film credits on IMDb and noticed an entry named Once Upon a Crime Something rang a bell and I clicked on it and after reading the plot summary it brought back a lot of memories br br I ve found it has aged pretty well despite the fact that it is not by any means a great comedy It is however rather enjoyable and is a good riff on a Hitchcock formula of mistaken identity and worldwide thrills br br The movie has a large cast of characters amongst them an American couple who find a woman s dog while vacationing in Europe and decide to return it to her for a reward only to find her dead body upon arrival From there the plot gets crazier and sillier and they go on the run after the police think they are the killers br br Kind of a mix between It s a Mad Mad Mad Mad World and a lighter Hitchcock feature this was directed by Eugene Levy and he managed to get some of his good friends such as John Candy to star in it The movie is mostly engaging due to its cast and the ending has a funny little twist that isn t totally unpredictable but also is kind of unexpected
I love Monte Carlo and thoroughly enjoyed this movie I thought everyone was very good I was not familiar with Richard Lewis I thought he made his character Julian Peters very personable funny and attractive Sean Young was very good as the befuddled rejected girl with a heart of gold George Hamilton was charming and the perfect Italian gigolo John Candy has a field day as the bon vivant James Belushi is hysterical as a total jerk Cybill Shepard gave a very sweet performance as a nice vulnerable ignored housewife Delightful ensemble cast Lots of talent clever script lots going on and beautiful locations Just a nice pick me up for a dreary day Especially in the winter when a trip to Europe is not anywhere on your horizon
With a well thought out cast this movie was a great comedic relief The plot is well written and the cast was knockout Every bit as good as the reviews suggested a rarity and was highly entertaining Being a huge John Candy fan myself this movie was no disappointment
This movie has an all star cast John Candy Richard Lewis Ornella Mutti Cybill Shepard and Jim Belushi to name a few run amuck in Monte Carlo as well as some other beautiful European locations and is very funny The trouble that everyone gets in when they lie to protect themselves is great and I highly recommend that you see this movie it is well worth it John Candy is in top form in Once Upon A Crime as is everyone else If you and your family are looking for a great family film this is your ticket Everyone gives stellar performances great acting great comedy and great timing which is rare in movies these days Great plot great mystery which I love anyways and overall well worth the money you spend on it So get the kids grab some popcorn juice or tea or sodas and enjoy the show
John Candy s Performance in Once Upon A Crime is possibly his best ever It s been My Favourite Movie since it came out I Spent 5 Years searching for it That s How Good It Is If You Disagree well that s your opinion Enjoy The Movie
I would reccomend this film to everyone Not only to the fans of the rocker Luciano Ligabue but to all film buffs Because it s sincere moving funny and true Because Ligabue is a born storyteller and a film lover and every frame of his film is made with love and care Because his characters are loved and ask to be loved Because most of the Italian debut films are lousy and this one done by an outsider is a real joy to watch and to listen at Because Stefano Accorsi is gorgeous and reminds me of Andrea Pazienza who was like Freccia beautiful and talented and good and lost his life because of the heroin that Ligabue shows as it is unglamorous and ugly without indulging in easy moralisms Because it s a film that speaks to our heart our ears our souls And because I lived the experience of the FM radios and it was exactly like that Thanks Luciano
about the importance of being young having friends and most of all enjoying life Through the experience of four friends Ligabue shows to the audience how life was back in the 70 s in a small italian village the four carachters represent the four different aspects of human behavior also the drug experience is well represented
Nice movie with a great soundtrack which spans through the rock landscape of the 70 s and 80 s Radiofreccia describes a generation it describes life in a small village near Correggio hometown of Ligabue the singer who wrote the book that inspired the movie it describes life of young people and their problems relating to the world It reminds of Trainspotting with a bit of Italian touch
Radiofreccia is still a good surprise in Italian cinema The film is based on a book of Italian songwriter Luciano Ligabue who also directs the movie and writes the music score of course br br The film is a portrait of north Italian province life in the Emilia Romagna region We re in 1975 the time of the first free radios one of the boys of the movie creates Radioraptus Youth wishes friendship love sex individual dramas and unemployment are among the themes but the film speaks also about drugs Freccia the main character is a victim of heroin slavery br br Without being boring and moralist the story flows very well the spontaneity of actors is strong and the way of directing as well Obviously Luciano Liga Ligabue is neither Fellini nor a movie professional first of all he s a musician But he succeeds in making a good product Unfortunately he ll not repeat the success with his second movie Da zero a dieci not good at all br br In Radiofreccia actors are generally not very famous the only star is Stefano Accorsi one of the most popular young Italian actors See in a small role another Italian songwriter Francesco Guccini he s the nice communist barman and football trainer
Radiofreccia is a movie about all of us about our dreams our friends our obsessions our addictions our fears It is a brilliant movie where a group of friends like all of us have lives through the hardships of growing up in a small town in one of the most significant decades in the last century The movie doesn t take a happy or sad approach on things it just tells us a story one that all of us could have experienced One of happiness and excitement sadness and grief The power of this story is in that we grow to love the characters it is one of those movies you will watch over and over again feeling closer to the little town in Emilia Romagna where it takes place Hoping one day to be able to finally walk its streets next to Freccia and his friends listening to the music that changed the world through the crackling sound of an old radio playing Radio Raptus International playing their dreams our dreams Radiofreccia will make you laugh it will make you cry at times it will shock you and comfort you it will give you and take from you Personally I believe it to have played an important part in my life and that of my friends and I suggest you all watch it and let it become part of yours
Now this show looks like most of the other shows of it s type from the mid 90 s but the only thing is about this one is that it s different they use a lot of comedy and action in this one and maybe a little bit of drama too I personally thought it was a good show I can t understand why would they cancel it The good thing is that the fan base of this show is still alive ever since 1997 up to date br br My hopes is that the WB bring back the show or even do a movie which I know is gonna be impossible to do but hey it doesn t hurt to dream doesn t it br br Anyway I would recommend if you hadn t seen it to find the DVD of all 13 episodes because the characters are great the story lines are good the comedy is good and well the whole show is just great
A classic cartoon always enjoyable and funny It has an interesting plot complete with lovable characters Road Rovers is a show worth seeing it is a short 13 episodes and if you can ever manage a chance to see it you should Unfortunately it is very hard to find I think Warner Brothers Studios should release a DVD that contains all 13 episodes I would definitely buy it if they did and if they do you should buy it too if you have kids who like dogs they will love road rovers Road Rovers should have gotten more attention while it was being aired it was definitely an original and very special show that should have been appreciated much more than it was
Far by my most second favourite cartoon Spielberg did after Animaniacs Even if the ratings were low so what I still enjoyed it and loved it was so funny and I adored the cast wow Jess Harnell and Tress Macneille were in there and were just fantastic the whole cast were brilliant especially the legendary Frank Welker br br I d love to see this cartoon again was so awesome and the jokes were brilliant Also I can remember the hilarious moment where Brain cameos in it you hear his voice and it played the PATB theme instrumental that was just fantastic I love it in those cartoons when cameos pop in I wish this cartoon and Animaniacs came back i loved them
The Road Rovers was a great show about canine superheroes chosen by the Master to fight crime around the world The show was hilarious to say the least Simple and complex jokes that could appeal to all ages Running jokes throughout the series that could spawn a drinking game The action was mesmerizing and cleverly set up The characters were very original each with a very different personality But what made me enjoy the show the most was the depth of the characters Each of them have struggles and emotional difficulties that are never expressed but implied in subtext Hopefully one day there ll be some way to watch the Rovers in action again
Michael Stearns plays Mike a sexually frustrated individual with an interesting moral attitude towards sexuality He has no problem ogling naked dancers but when women start having sex with men that s when he loses it He believes that when women actually have sex that s when they lose any sense of innocence and or beauty So he strolls through the Hollywood Hills stalking lovemaking couples at a distance ultimately shooting the men dead with a high powered rifle with a scope br br The seeming primary reason for this movie s existence is to indulge in sexual activity over and over again The story comes off as more of an afterthought This is bound to make many a happily heterosexual male quite pleased as we re treated to enough protracted scenes of nudity the ladies here look awfully good sans clothes and sex to serve as a major dose of titillation Of course seeing a fair deal of it through a scope ups the creepiness factor considerably and illustrates the compulsion towards voyeurism For one thing Mike eyes the couples through the scope for minutes at a time before finally pulling the trigger This is all underscored by awfully intrusive if somewhat atmospheric music on the soundtrack br br Those with a penchant for lurid trash are bound to enjoy this to one degree or another It even includes one lesbian tryst that confounds Mike and renders him uncertain how to react It unfolds at a very slow pace but wraps up with a most amusing ironic twist It s a kinky and twisted rarity that if nothing else is going to definitely keep some viewers glued to the screen br br 7 10
I enjoyed this movie Haven t seen Andy Griffith in ages and felt he fit this role perfectly I ve associated him with comedy but am pleased to see that he s versatile br br I wasn t troubled that Dotty s anxiety disorder may not have been verbatim from a psychiatric textbook There are zillions of whatever phobias and neuroses and these can take on a broad variety of quantitative and qualitative forms She is clearly a sensitive with extra sensory powers as was understood by the local Indians but not by any Anglos It is not surprising that this character is vulnerable and nominally eccentric br br Although this is taken to be a light family movie it is actually more sophisticated than it seems Also Hiram s twist at the end came as a pleasant surprise to me and tied all the preceding action together in a bundle It s fun to contemplate the possibility of such spiritual guidance
Though not in the whole film Andy Griffith again plays his role best in this CBS tv movie The plot is easy Griffith s character dies and his last wish is that his wife and kids scatter his ashes is the place he named Mountains Somewhere Though it will never be seen on TV and never be released on video if you do get the chance to watch this TAKE IT
I saw that when I was little and it was excellent Kelsey White as Lisa and the Meecy Mices where cute Susan Bonde as Doodle and Sandra Dee Heidecke as Snoodle where Hilarius Karen Boettcher Tate as Profster was interesting Burl Ross as Little Bunny Foo Foo was funny Gregory Donavon as Kaiso was brilliant Whats Hilarius that Snoodle and Doodle eat too much candy Whats sad that Little Bunny Foo Foo that bops the Meecy Mices on the head then by a fairy will give Little Bunny Foo Foo few wishes then he turns into goon This story is about when Lisa Snoodle Doodle go to the Big Rock Candy Mountains This show is excellent the kids will like this show new words songs and watching them playing
me and my sister use to rent this every time we got movies and our parents would get so mad at so but they let us anyways and I love it I can t find anyone that lives near me that knows what I am talking about I m glad to see that I m not the only one that loved this movie I wish i could find this on DVD somewhere I would love to watch this now just bc I loved it so much as a little kid and I m 15 now I remember so much about it thats where I got the little bunny fufu song from and all my friends know the song but not the movie I think the little girl got there by sliding down the slide on her little playground thing
So when i was little i got this movie as a present and my sister and i loved it we would watch it all the time when our friends came over we would have sleepovers and we d watch big rock candy mountain and grandpa s magical toys I m 21 now and i still love this movie some old friends and i recently got together and watched it we knew all the songs and we danced and talked about how much we hated Profster when we were little One friend actually bought this movie and grandpa s magical toys for her 2 year old daughter because she wants to pass on our love of this movie This really is a movie you can let your kids watch and feel safe no violence no bad language just lots of great songs and important lessons
Big rock candy mountain is amazing i watched it when i was little and still do to this day senior in high school if i could imagine heaven that is what it would look like i wish i could live in big rock candy mountain where candy grows on trees Zach Hyman is profs and my best friend little bunny foo foo is the man it is so fuzzy and colorful that i dream about it at night in fact my friend who is 18 recently watched it for the first time and absolutely loved it i recommend that people of all ages watch this movie i am having a huge party this weekend with all my friends to watch this incredible movie we are going to order pizza and watch the teddy bears giggle i constantly find myself watching clouds and wishing i was that little girl that got to visit thanks bye
When I was little my parents got this movie for me to watch I really liked it and I watched it over and over again Even when I was in 3rd grade I still watched it from time to time Recently I watched it again just for the sake of nostalgia and though the show was not aimed for my age group I m in my late teens I still found it entertaining and educational This show teaches good lessons about imagination and getting along well with others Some parts I found quite entertaining Also this show does not have any bad content so you can leave kids alone with this show and not worry about them picking up any bad language or whatnot I would recommend this
This incredibly formulaic flick from the Walker Texas Ranger squad contains some of the most unbelievable scenes ever witnessed within a TV movie In addition one can pretty much predict the outcome from the get go However it s a fun little movie that gets the job done it entertains That s all it was meant to do and it does so The stunts and explosions are fun and exciting and the plot isn t half bad The acting is also decent which isn t much of a surprise because everyone knows that Chuck Norris is no Steven Seagal If you re a fan of the genre and of Walker Texas Ranger you will definitely love this If not then don t waste your time 8 10
A true hero of modern times Chuck Norris has left TV Walker Rexas Ranger and is looking new steps for his artistic career The President s man is the second movie of a future TV series with Norris in the title role and with young actors like Jennifer Tung or Judson Mills one of the young rangers of Walker The old master teachs to young aspirant It s one of the most powerful themes of The president s man In this tima A line in the sand has reached world surprise for his tratment of terrorism in USA months before the tragic September 11 Eric Norris son of Chuck is the director The movie is amusing a good action work plenty of fights and heroism Chuck Norris have many plans for the future Bells of innocence his next picture will be the following br br
Good show very entertaining Good marshal arts acting Good story plot The entire main crew did a nice job from Robert Urich to Chuck Norris Jennifer Tung and especially a BIG hand to Judson Mills An especially fine tribute to Robert Urich in his latter days A GREAT actor who will be truly missed
There are a few spoilers in this comment br br Contrary to the comments I just read by nativetex4u and a few others I really liked the movie and would love to see it as a weekly series br br I am a Judson Mills fan but also a huge Chuck Norris fan and while I ll admit that a few of the action scenes may have stretched the line a little the storyline fit right in with other weekly series that are currently being aired br br The opening fifteen minutes with Deke running from the bad guys after blowing up their missiles was very action packed I do fail to see how that many professionals weren t able to hit a moving target but the action was definitely there and Deke being the hero had to survive br br As for the comment about needing to get the movie in the can to fill the time slot after the playoffs This movie was not originally scheduled by CBS for a January airing and filming was completed in May of 2001 a good 4 months before the terrorist attacks against the U S br br If the writer of the comment had been paying attention to the movie instead of trying to avoid it maybe they would have realized the plot of the story Rashid a Bin Laden like character planned to set off a nuclear device in the United States The President s Man was called in to locate and eliminate the problem br br Perhaps the writer should actually WATCH the movie before attempting to comment on it br br
I ve always enjoyed seeing Chuck Norris in film Although the acting may not be superb the fight scenes are fantastic I also enjoyed seeing Judson Mills perform along side him In my opinion the Norris Brothers have proven themselves to be fine entertainers and this was yet another fine production I hope you take the time to view this movie
Ooverall the movie was fairly good a good action plot with a fair amount of explosions and fight scenes but Chuck Norris did hardly anything except for disarm the bomb and shoot a few characters The movie was very similar to the events of Sept 11 with a bin laden like terrorist sending a video to the president Urich and threatening to detonate it Judson Mills had some superb action roles taking out Rashid s compound and various kick butt roles but there was a lack of Chuck Norris Judson took over most of the action leaving Joshua chuck with Que on her computer But overall it was realistic and didn t lack the action but only did it on Mr Norris part I gave the film 7 10
If you re a a fan of either or both Chuck Norris Judson Mills then this is the movie to see It has a lot of adventure in it It is a great follow up to President s Man The chemistry between the main three stars Chuck Norris Judson Mills Jennifer Tung is incredible My personal opinion This movie along with the original has turned out so well that the networks should consider turning it into a regular series If you ve seen President s Man i recommend this movie for you If you ve seen President s Man A Line In The Sand but you haven t seen President s Man then let me suggest that you do You will not be disappointed with either one
Composed elegant Carol marvelously played by the beautiful Rebecca Brooke her nice husband Eddie likable David Houseman Carol s wacky constantly eating best gal pal Anna delightfully essayed with infectious comic zeal by the adorable Chris Jordan and Anna s hunky amorous husband Pete a typically fine Eric Edwards are a quartet of liberated swingers who enjoy having frequent group sex with each other Their usual routine gets disrupted when Carol s lonely repressed but still alluring widow mother Jennifer a superbly moving performance by the lovely Jennifer Welles drops by for a visit Pretty soon Jennifer loosens up and becomes a willing participant in the swingers blithely pleasurable and uninhibited carnal lifestyle with everyone except Carol eager to seduce her Writer director Joe Sarno concocts a sharp engrossing and perceptive examination of suburban angst and the limitations of the whole wild n easy 70 s sexual revolution Sarno turns traditional middle class mores on their heads and further spices things up with a bold and provocative mother daughter incest subplot Moreover Sarno elicits uniformly first rate acting from the bang up cast Welles and Brooke are both exceptional with excellent support from Edwards Jordan Houseman Arlana Blue as flaky New Age sex therapist Shandara and Erica Eaton as saucy neighbor Mrs Fields Better still all the women are extremely hot and enticing Welles in particular seriously steams up the screen with her exquisitely voluptuous figure and smoldering erotic presence The sex scenes are really sizzling and fairly explicit but never raunchy or tedious Stephen Colwell s bright polished cinematography and Jack Justis bouncy melodic acoustic folk score are both on the money solid and effective Recommended viewing for Sarno fans
First saw this gem from Joe Sarno way back when and I must say that after seeing it I could never forget Jennifer Welles At first I thought the film was moving a bit slower than i would expect for a Sarno film but when Jennifer made her entrance the first time I ever saw her anywhere I was sat up and took notice Her presence in this film is hard to avoid and spices up every scene she s involved in I ve seen most of the rest of Sarno s films and the other films starring or featuring Jennifer Welles and I must say that this was both Sarno and Jennifer at their collective best Sarno s direction in this film of domestic adult drama is superb and Jennifer showed figuratively and literally an acting prowess that make this a must see Co stars Rebecca Brooke aka Mary Mendum and Chris Jordan both frequent co stars of Ms Welles and also frequent stars of Sarno s work turn in believable performances as a pair of adventurous yet normal housewives This film is Sarno classic
Ah the 1970 s A time when it was in to be a swinger To be honest today is also a good time to be a swinger but it just felt more daring then br br Joe Sarno offers up a pretty good soft core film In fact just like today some of the actors are famous hardcore actors Unlike today these people were good actors and these films had a plot and character development br br It s pretty much what you would expect out of a swinger s movie Two couples with open relationships re ignite the wanderlust out of the MILF of one of the women who has come for a visit Not much more to it br br Of course when the MILF is Jennifer Welles then it is a different story Not too many 40 somethings look as delicious undressed as Ms Welles It s worth the price alone to see Ms Welles look at herself in the mirror as if she s Aphrodite She s no Stifler s Mom She s way sexier br br I also digged Chris Jordan s Anna Jordan looks and sounds so much like Elaine Joyce that I thought she might be her separated at birth twin or even Elaine herself Anna is always eating but must have incredible metabolism br br Unlike 1990 s soft core porn 70 s softie porn retained the hardcore film s realism something that 2000 s soft core has brought back on occasion instead of the 90 s music and canned orgasms and it is here in full force It s not real but it feels real br br For those who enjoyed the Quebec produced Deux Femmes En Or you ll enjoy this one Another classic film only on Drive In Classics the best 2 50 CAN a month you can spend
This movie is far better than the original The Jerk I would highly recommend it to anyone who like quirky humor We have incorporated almost as many lines from this movie into our daytime discourse as we have from Monty Python br br The card game with the hobos and then with Mr Suicide The scene at the dinner table and his distaste for turtle soup The original The Jerk was too choreographed ans staged While I like Steve Martin he seemed like he was trying to hard The Jerk Too is a spoof and will be enjoyed by anyone The Jerk Too is family friendly unlike the original The Jerk
Honestly when I saw this movie years ago I immediately wanted to turn it off As I sat there for the next 10 minutes or so I realized that the actor playing Navin stole the show His facial expressions and comedic demeanor makes me shake my head as to WHY he hasn t been in more comedies He has this Marty Feldman thing going for him but MUCH MUCH more talent taking nothing away from Marty The movie really shocked me by how close it was to the original Jerk but then again it was SO MUCH MORE I really think that if this movie was released first and I saw the Steve Martin movie 2nd I d think the 2nd was a cheap rip off I know it sounds like a BOLD statement but it s true I actually like Steve Martin a great deal but his performance is 2nd to the actor in The Jerk Too I wish I could get a copy of it for my collection I urge you to see it if you can find it
I m on the opposite end of the previous comment br br First of all I don t think this was intended to be a straight sequel to The Jerk I mean it s not titled The Jerk 2 it s The Jerk Too which leads me to believe that while a lot of the character names are the same it actually revolves around a completely different person br br Think about it Virtually no connection to the previous movie other than character names a totally different story different cast and the fact that it s a partial musical br br I say give this movie some credit It does have plenty of laughs in it Mark Blankfield at his prime
I don t understand Not being a critic i am not evaluating the quality of the acting which I find believable a good thing My confusion lies with the content Is no one else sensitive to the fact that these two unfaithful women were justifying their infidelity to men who were fighting and bleeding to guarantee the continued freedom of their families and their country Should there not have been a prologue informing us if the men made it home and if so what effect their cheating wives infidelity had on them While these women were bedding their paramours out of a sense loneliness did they think that their husbands were enjoying being shot at while facing death or dismemberment daily They didn t think of their husbands at all Only of themselves Pardon me except when they wished their husbands dead
Stuck in a hotel in Kuwait I happily switched to the channel showing this at the very beginning First Pachelbel s Canon brought a lump to my throat then the sight of a Tiger Moth which my grandfather my father and I have all flown produced a slight dampness around the eyes and then Crowe s name hooked me completely I was entranced by this film Crowe s performance again the subject matter and yes what a debt we owe how various matters were addressed and dealt with the flying sequences my father flew Avro Ansons too the story and as another contributor pointed out Crowe s recitation of High Flight I won t spoil the film for anyone but separated from my wife by 4 000 odd miles as an ex army officer who was deployed in a couple of wars and as private pilot I admit to crying heartily a couple of times Buy it rent it download it beg borrow or steal it but watch it br br PS Did I spy a Bristol Blenheim in yellow training colours on the ground Looked like a twin engine aircraft with a twin 303 Brownings in a dorsal turret
I became more emotionally attached to this movie than any other I have ever watched That may be because I can see the characters as my own grandparents attempting to make sense of a world at war The ending and use of Pachabel s Cannon are both amazing
I felt this film throughout I waas impressed with Russell Crowe s talent in developing his relationship with Lillie such a typical Aussie blend of softly softly approach a bit self depreciating and very persistent Really loved the cinematography and direction Pace was just right and the portrayals of nearly all characters was impressive br br Gosh didn t Russell s talent even in 1993 shine and I have yet to see Gladiator
I have just seen this film and fallen in love with it There is a little bit of something for everyone and its a particular free for all when it comes to the romance between Lachlan and Lil When they are on the beach I nearly cried there is the unspoken realization that time is the most precious commodity and it is most evident when they are together This idea taken from several angles from marriage to sibblings to finding love in the least conventional of places The film almost makes you long for that kind of desperation when you know that tomorrow could very well be your last Crowe was particularly wonderful in his role of Lachlan I ve always had a soft spot for the accent but I nearly melted with his portrayal of his character The way this film was shot is also beautiful with the music backdrop of the open fields and superb acting All together this is a wonderful film that tugs at all of human emotions
I enjoyed every moment of this movie even though I knew they could never really be together With the life expectancy of a Bomber pilot being only six weeks It made me feel for all of those women and men back in the 1940 s who must have lived this story
Russell my fav is gorgeous in this film But more than that the film covers a tremendous range of human passion and sorrow Everything from marriage to homosexuality is addressed and respected The film makes the viewer realize that tolerance of other humans provides the route to saving humanity Fabulous love story between Lachlin and Lil I replay their scenes over and over again Anyone who has ever been in love will empathize with these people All characters are cast and portrayed excellently
Very nicely done movie It does stay in your memory Better billed as a romance than flying or war altho the flying parts are realistic and almost error free Flying buffs like myself will enjoy this movie even if attracted by the airplanes unless they have no sensitivity or have never been in love br br Fun watching early Crowe He is good and exudes charm His reading of High Flight is superb br br cheers Boom
This film takes you to another time when there was a different pace to everyday life We get an idea how families had to deal with the war and how quickly we sent young men off to fight A very touching look at the past and a reminder that casualties of war don t just happen on the front br br Luckily many of us have never had to go through what our great grandparents grandparents or parents went through during a war This film I think is a small thank you Peter Outerbridge looks amazingly like a young Peter O Toole and Russell Crowe is absolutely charming and as Australian as he can be It s definitely worth listening to him recite High Flight and makes me wonder what he might accomplish with Shakespeare
Japanese Tomo Akiyama s Keko Mask 1993 is extremely enjoyable trash film and so fun to watch There are also some sequels but I haven t seen them since these films are hyper rare Some kind of re releases some day would be nice since I think many trash lovers would like these films The tongue in cheek story is about one extremely strict school in which teachers think that it is okay to torture students in order to attain discipline which is according to the teachers the most important thing in education The school is lead by incredibly funny looking just look at the costume human wizard whatever who is like principal in the school and it only adds to the campiness that it is never explained why he wears such a costume since all other teachers are perfectly normally clothed Well the main thing about the film is its name Keko Mask who is some beautiful and masked fairy who comes always to save the girls and students who are abused and tortured by the teachers Yes this superheroine is one effective female as she kicks and fights the evil teachers with totally cheesy soundtrack playing on the background The most important thing is of course that she wears nothing but a cape and a mask with the rest of her body naked Her identity is never revealed in these films and also the credits say Keko Mask Unknown while the actor names are listed br br The most hilarious thing in this film is how Keko Mask kills her enemies She has a gorgeous but lethal vagina Yes you read right She kills her victims by flying in the air in front of them spreading her legs and letting the enemies become numbly charmed of the view after which she flies closer and snaps their necks with her legs The most usual last line the characters say in this film are like I ve never seen such a beautiful vagina and Now I can die in peace This film is totally fantastic br br There are also some great taunts towards Japanese society for example its attitude towards sex in films Japanese censors optically fog blur all the pubic hair in any film and also about some restrictions among school students like girls and boys are not allowed to talk in this film etc There s one great scene in which one nerd sees girl s bare you know what for the first time and says Hey there s no fog in it I couldn t help but laugh during this scene as I thought what do the Japanese censors think about this Also one character says in the end that he will return if Japan Films allows to make the sequel I m glad it allowed as I ve heard the sequels are equally outrageous One sequel should include Blues Brothers yes THOSE Blues Brothers in it etc br br This is trash in its most enjoyable funniest and also cleverest form and so it is a little shame these films are so hard to find This would definitely be even greater experience if it was little more fast moving at times as it becomes little boring at one point but fortunately those segments are very few This film has to be seen to be fully believed as there are so many trash elements I don t mention here and it wouldn t be even necessary to tell them all here If you like trash cinema and films made with tongue in very cheek I think you ll love this little gem as I do and the director is definitely a genius in this field 8 10 Perhaps the only film in which a shining vagina is this lethal
I turned this on to see the incredible Ethel Waters whose autobiography I am now reading I ll admit my jaw dropped when the pork chops and watermelon references started rolling in but people cannot look at this movie as a stereotypical or racist piece It s pretty much a short film made by blacks for blacks at a time when the entertainment industry was quite segregated and the stereotypes to the people involved were the jokes of their time old trends exaggerated for humor We see modern black movies do the same thing but with the new trends stereotypes ho s and the hood and such I think if you look back in eighty years you would find today s movies will look just as racist What viewers should appreciate about this film is the talent of Waters and the pint sized Sammy Davis Jr who out taps his contemporary Shirley Temple and looks remarkably the same facially as he did as an adult Everyone involved in this film clearly had a lot of fun making it Why not enjoy it for what it is instead of what you think it should have been
Given the opposite circumstance of 2009 where the reality is we do have a black president this movie takes on quite a powerful historical significance For entertainment value I found this movie to be both engaging and repugnant I was quite taken back of course by the blatant racism of the time but also found the music and dancing incredible Also it is quite cool to see Sammy Davis Jr as such a very young child actor He plays Rufus Jones a young boy who is being consoled by his Mammy He is told Why some day you could be President This was so ridiculous in 1933 that it was mocked and thought to be endearing charming and funny The bulk of the movie is a fantasy sequence of what the government would be like if it was run by a black man They depict the seats of government as being like a revivalist Baptist church br br The fact was when I stumbled onto this movie one day it drew me in It is really well done and very entertaining I believe if we can look beyond the racism we can see this movie for all it brings us In fact to realize that it is not only not ridiculous to have a black president but that it is normal just makes this movie that much more relevant It clearly marks a moment in time for our collective consciousness
Now many would think to stay away from this movie just because of the title If you do not have the stomach for gory movies then what are you doing reading this review Anyhow I borrowed the video from a friend of mine and fell in love with this movie immediately This movie is chock full of wonderful gore plus the usual other ingredients that make up a b movie add up to one hell of a viewing experience If you re a lover of good quality experiences then by all means watch this great flick
no this is not supposed to be a high budget brilliance but it is brilliant in its own right you have to look at it for what it is a low budget masterpiece involving a zombie rapist wielding a 12 inch love rod that he keeps out flapping in stride those who came to give this movie a low review were probably looking for the next cult classic or hidden gem as they say and just didn t quite get there i love how everyone points out obvious observations such as the 5 cent baby attached to a fish pole hahaha well yes i don t think a movie with a budget like this could afford good actors or effects so they worked with what they had the guts and entrails were actually very convincing the movie was a little choppy going from sequence to sequence but overall this is one of the better movies i have seen lately that doesn t follow any trend or predictability very good for a laugh
Well this movie was probobly one of the funniest scary movie i have ever seen The effects are so bad you just have to laugh and the acting well lets say its no mel gibson But Gary Browning who plays an police officer is so damn bad he becomes good I dont know how but he him self makes this movie a 10 You must see it if your in to horror slash movies cause its bloody and funny at the same time Killer movie
Why does this have such a low rating I really don t get it Is it because of the bad acting The bad dialogue Well who cares about these things in cheesy low budget horror movies Seriously the acting and the dialogue isn t important in those movies People who hate movies only because of bad acting and bad dialogue shouldn t be allowed to rate cheesy low budget movies Those movies shouldn t be taken seriously Period br br Anyway time to talk about the movie right Well I loved it I bought it because I expected a gorefest but it s not a gorefest and the gore is pretty bad most of the time it s just animal guts placed on the body of the actors and that s lame but I didn t really care because the movie is hilarious The characters are hilarious the acting is hilarious bad acting is a GOOD thing in cheesy low budget horror movies the dialogue is hilarious bad dialogue is a GOOD thing in cheesy low budget horror movies the zombie rapist with a huge dick is hilarious the flying demon baby is hilarious and I could go on and on and on but I don t want to say too much BUT I have to mention that there s a scene in which a girl masturbates a sex doll like it s alive lol Oh and the zombie rapist falls in love with the sex doll lol br br Best lines in the movie br br Detective Manners sniffs coke Detective Sloane What the beep are you doing Manners What the hell did you snort What the hell is that Detective Manners It s nothing man it s Ehh Cold medicine br br Detective Manners injects heroin in his arm Detective Sloane What the beep are you doing Manners Are you beep insane Detective Manners It s cold medicine br br Detective Manners repeatedly kicks a random guy in the face Detective Sloane What the hell s going on Manners What are you doing Detective Manners This maniac was rambling about demons and then he started smashing his head on the rock He just started smashing his head on the rock I think he s on PCP or something br br LOL
Sure this movie wasn t like 16 blocks inside man an American haunting etc br br But It was a great mystery that can happen to anyone of us i found this movie really great and scary br br I live exactly where they filmed this movie san pedro California And we have heard true stories based on incidents of this movie br br I dunno if you ve heard of the famous boat in long beach Queen Mary Well that boat is haunted i believe in spirts illusions and parallel or however u spell that is real everybody s in there own universe br br and the mind is a powerful thing br br i recommend to watch this movie it s great and not bad directing at all br br for those who rate it a 1 they don t understand the film its meaning its plot its view and how bad the ocean life can be for each and everyone of us br br Ty br br Victor
I borrowed this movie despite its extremely low rating because I wanted to see how the crew manages to animate the presence of multiple worlds As a matter of fact they didn t at least so its seems Some cameo appearance cut rather clumsily into the movie that s it this is what the majority of viewers think However the surprise comes at the end and unfortunately then when probably most of the viewers have already stopped this movie I was also astonished when I saw that the Brazilian Portuguese title of this movie means Voyage into Death This is THE spoiler br br That this movie is about a young girl who goes ALONE onto this boat on reasons that are completely unclear you understand only in the last 5 minutes When you start the movie with the English title Haunted Boat in your head you clearly think that the cameo appearances of strange figures are the ghosts But in reality this movie is not like most other horror movies told from the distant writer watcher perspective who can at almost any time differentiate between different levels of reality it is told from the perspective of the young girl We see her not alone but together with the four friends because SHE sees them We do not see that she is alone So the parallel worlds are not the cameo appearances flickering into the picture stream but the main story We have at least two parallel worlds The world in which the girl is and the world in which the 4 friends are An intrusion of a third world is probably the young man with the medical skills who comes for a short time on the boat br br I cannot get rid of the deep conviction that with this movie the movie makers cheated an audience of several thousand people by letting them believe that what they have done is more or less a sophomore film student elaborate with hastily chosen pseudo actors that have met just the night before the start of the shooting in a dump after at least twelve beers How mistaken can one be But in addition to this big surprise which one learns only in the very last minutes the end that follows gives another surprise The girl is saved by a crew in a helicopter and another boat When she has recovered from her shock she visits again the place at the harbor where she ascended the boat together with the four friends And there they are again They wave her to them from the boat which has already taken off shore She jumps into the water arrives at the boat and they are away Miraculously beautiful It remembers me a bit to the end of a poem by a Rhetoromance writer When I awoke I saw Death standing at my bed But I closed my eyes When I opened them again he was gone
I also saw this upon its release in 56 and have been struck since then with its final scene If this is an answer to High Noon then it s an apt and apposite response The notion that as this string is headed The town comes together is a much stronger message than the lonely personal heroism of High Noon In this theme Concho is a phenomenal precursor of one my other all time favorites The Magnificent Seven Both Sinatra and Conrad give impressive and convincing performances especially Sinatra s transformation from bullying kid brother to liberating town savior I can only hope that at some point all the friends and family on whom over the years I ve inflicted my affection for this movie will have the opportunity to experience it for themselves
I was lucky enough to get to see this film many years ago in England I ve seen hundreds of films since but I ve never forgotten this one Although Sinatra was playing a not very endearing character he was excellent in the role A lot of people seem to think that he did nt really come into his own until his role in From Here To Eternity but in my opinion he was magnificent in Concho The other role that sticks in my mind is that of William Conrad I d never see or heard of him before this film Conrad plays a terrific part in this film I remember his deep and gravelly voice and he uses it beautifully to enhance the few words he speaks with a menace that sets the tone of his character Also I remember the music that both introduces Conrad and and seems to surround him whenever he appears An excellent film and my only disappointment was that I never ever got the chance to see it again It seems to have disappeared from the face of the earth I see in the titles that it says that the film is in black and white but when I saw it was indeed in full color I remember Sinatra s blue shirt
I ve always liked Johnny Concho and I wish this film were out on VHS and DVD Frank Sinatra gives one of the most unusual performances in his career in this one br br When we first meet Frank in the film s title role he s the brother of a notorious gunfighter who s out of town at the moment The brother strikes terror in the heart s of the town and Frank takes full advantage of that to bully the townspeople safe and secure in his shadow Only Phyllis Kirk has any feeling for him She s the daughter of storekeeper Wallace Ford and Dorothy Adams br br Two other gunmen arrive William Conrad and Christopher Dark and it turns out Conrad has killed Sinatra s brother and he s coming to his town to take over They humiliate Sinatra and run him out of town Kirk follows him br br Overnight Sinatra turns from punk into coward and becomes a man searching for some kind of backbone It s a well acted performance almost as good as his Oscar nominated role in The Man With a Golden Arm Pity for some reason this has not been seen for years br br Two other performances of note are Keenan Wynn as former gunfighter turned preacher who helps Sinatra find what he needs to stand up to Conrad and Dark And then there is Conrad in what I believe was his career role on screen He s a villain of incredible malevolence pure evil incarnate walking and talking on the silver screen br br However what I like about Johnny Concho is the climax an unforgettable one where Conrad and Dark are dealt with Let s just say I believe Johnny Concho was MGM s answer to High Noon and a primer for what you do when evil causes a break down in all law and order
Still Crazy is without a doubt the greatest rock comedy of all time It has been erroneously compared to This Is Spinal Tap which it has no relation to Spinal Tap is a satire and quite frankly not a very good one in spite of it s outing of many rock clich√©s Unlike Tap Still Crazy is populated by great actors great songs and great human situations You CARE about the people in Still Crazy That s all that matters Oh yeah the music s pretty damn good too written by Mick Jones of Foreigner and Chris Difford of Squeeze American audiences were already familiar with Stephen Rea The Crying Game but would only later become familiar with Bill Nighy Underworld Love Actually Pirates Of The Caribbean II and Timothy Spall the Harry Potter movies
Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais have a solid hit rate as far as their TV work is concerned However their film work has been much more chequered 2008 s The Bank Job was fine the previous year s Across The Universe decidedly weak for instance br br Still Crazy fortunately is a solid success It has a great story excellent performances a lot of humour fabulous music and above everything else real heart br br I savour moments and this film has one of them just when everything is going pear shaped at the festival reunion performance br br Hugely enjoyable
I have rarely emerged from viewing a film with such a warm happy feeling I felt as if I had been out with really good friends and had a wonderful time I thoroughly enjoyed this film The acting was superb although I would have to mention Bill Nye in particular as giving an absolutely faultless performance Bill is an excellent actor and would love to see him in more films Timothy Spall and Jimmy Nail are also favourites and always love to see them as they give such a solid performance And Billy Connolly as always totally gorgeous It was a wonderful ensemble performance from all concerned Such a refreshing experience to see a well written superbly acted and good looking movie
Still Crazy has been compared to the Spinal Tap since both are comedies about wash up R R groups Actually here the similarity ends because Still Crazy is much better written and acted out whereas Spinal Tap script deteriorates from the mildly amusing first 10 min into a drivel that makes Beavis and Butthead to appear sophisticated in comparison Still Crazy is formulaic but the likability of the characters and the unexpectedly high quality of some musical numbers for me managed to offset the a priori predictability of the movie People who expect Spinal Tap like attempt on satire would be disappointed by the light hearted nature of the movie but I d take a successful self ironic romp of Still Crazy over a pompous but failed shot at satire which is Spinal Tap
wonderful movie with good story great humour some great one liners and a soundtrack to die for br br i ve seen it 3 times so far br br the american audiences are going to love it
I watched the movie in a preview and I really loved it The cast is excellent and the plot is sometimes absolutely hilarious Another highlight of the movie is definitely the music which hopefully will be released soon I recommend it to everyone who likes the British humour and especially to all musicians Go and see It s great
I enjoyed Still Crazy more than any film I have seen in years A successful band from the 70 s decide to give it another try They start by playing some gigs in some seedy European venues with hilarious results The music is fantastic the script and acting are terrific The characters are spot on especially the lead singer with the high heavy metal voice makeup and personality problems The concert at the end was unreal Go and see it preferably in a cinema with a good sound system
An excellent cast makes this movie work all of the characters are developed exceedingly well and it s clear that the actors enjoyed filming this movie br br It s not quite the comedy I expected much more a lighthearted look at the attempt to reclaim youthful glory than bawdy humor For music fans there are quite a few subtle references that in themselves are intelligently funny br br I hate drawing direct comparisons to other movies but so much of this movie reminded me of Alan Parker films I can t help it imagine if The Commitments actually did make it big and then tried to recapture said glory 25 years later
If you like Deep Purple you will enjoy in this excellent movie with Stephen Rea in main role The story is about the most famous rock group back there in 70s Strange Fruits and they decided to play together again But of course there is going to be lots of problem during theirs concerts Jimmy Nail and Bill Nighy are great and song The Flame Still Burns is perfect You have to watch it
This movie maked me cry at the end I watch at least 3 4 movies a week I seen loads of great movies even more crap ones But when ending scene catharsic at it s core came I Cried And if you didn t you have serious problems The story is archetypal nothing new or original But it s real because that sort of things really happened and that people really exist Glam isn t my sort of music but I really admire all that they went through in early 70 s At some point this directed me toward Velvet Goldmine Docudramas never really work very good But this movie really meked us believe it all Because they don t try to make it as a path full of glorious concerts present musicians that are superheroes groupie girls that are stupid and emotionally numb they don t glorify drugs and alcohol they promote rehabilitation and redemption that comes even 20 years late Once again great movie Since Leaving Las Vegas I was never so moved by a movie
I didn t approach Still Crazy with any real anticipation Just another rock n roll picture I figured good nostalgia for the baby boomers This film is partially that but so much more Brian Gibson the director previously helmed a biography of Tina Turner and is quite successful in his style I suppose it is fitting that this was his last film br br The cast is well chosen Bill Nighy is perfect in his role as the band s frontman Actor turned director Bruce Robinson appears as the band s washed up guitarist He does a superb job even though he hasn t appeared on film since the late 70 s If you re looking for an touching and funny film with some great songs you ve found it br br 7 4 out of 10
I love this movie It is one of those movies that you can watch time and time again and still find engaging Congratulations I believe everyone involved in making the movie and the script should be proud of themselves It is so eerie you feel like you are watching a real life band I would like to see more movies like this I am glad that they did not choose famous Hollywood stars to be in this movie because it probably would not have worked And even if Billy Connolly is quite well known he really got stuck into the role and I could not imagine anybody else playing it Congratulations again I really believe this movie deserves the Peter Sellers Comedy Award for Bill Nighy And when you get to the final scene well what can I say
I thought this movie was fantastic It was hilarious Kinda reminded me of Spinal Tap This is a must see for any fan of 70 s rock I hope me and my friends aren t like that in twenty years br br Bill Nighy gives an excellent performance as the off kilter lead singer trying to recapture that old spirit br br Stephen Rea fits perfectly into the movie as the glue trying to hold the band together but not succeeding well br br If you love music and were ever in a band this movie is definitely for you You won t regret seeing this movie I know I don t Even my family found it funny and that s saying something
As an aging rocker this movie mentions Heep and Quo my 2 favourite bands ever but with the incredible cast everyone and the fantastic storyline I just love this piece of creative genius I cannot recommend it more highly and Mick Jones added so much Foreigner lead and primary songwriter along with the greatest rock singer ever Lou Gramm I have watched this great work more than 10 times Bill Nighy what a voice and Jimmy Nail talent oozes from every pore then Astrid and Karen what more could an aging rocker ask for 10 10 bloody brilliant br br Alastair Perth Western Oz Originally from Windsor England
I agree with what veinbreaker wrote with regards to the Ahhhh feeling you get at the end of this movie I absolutely loved the locations they chose to film the songs were well written and interesting especially the psychedelic sounding track on which Hans Matheson sings It s trippy Nighy was fab in his role Nail nailed it Beano was the typical drummer and Rea kept it together Bruce Robinson was awesome Helena was a lovely girlfriend But I felt Juliet Aubrey s performance was gorgeous The scenes between Aubrey Robinson killed me Perfectly played and the music behind the scene was spot on Too bad not many more musicians have checked this movie out They ought to I ve told all my musician friends great quote by Jimmy Nail s character it s supposed to be rock roll not the Phantom of the f g opera
I spotted this movie in the video store a few years ago and rented it My husband and I enjoyed it so much we bought the VHS and have enjoyed it ever since br br The plot has been well discussed so no need in going over it again The point is this movie deserves repeated viewings Americans especially aren t going to get all the jokes the first time around I know I didn t br br This movie is funny touching sad all at the same time When Ray proposes the toast at his daughter s wedding it s cringe inducing When Karen calls Tony Brian as he attempts to kiss her it s heartbreaking When Beano is finally cornered by the woman in black it s too funny for words br br And the music it s as good as any movie soundtrack I ve heard in years I was dancing in the living room to All Over the World br br Every performance is absolutely perfect Bill Nighy has been justly complimented for his portrayal of Ray a man who has had one too many bad trips Stephen Rea is perfect as Tony the lovable keyboard player who has carried a torch for Karen all these years He has an appealing hangdog look that makes women want to hug him But all the actors are equally brilliant br br Ignore any pans you read about this movie and see it It s a gem
In the voice over which begins the film Hughie Billy Connolly a roadie for the great 70 s band Strange Fruit said the reason lightning struck at a rock festival to stop Strange Fruit s set was that God was sick of 70 s excess Indeed it s been popular to put down that era of music and see punk as a welcome antidote to it While I agree the excess was tiresome as well as the misogynistic urges which came out of it and like punk I still am a fan of what is considered classic rock or glam rock and this film about Strange Fruit s long strange reunion is an affectionate tribute to those days br br One of the reasons the film works is the care of the people behind the scenes Brian Gibson directed WHAT S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT about Tina Turner while I had problems with the dramatic parts of the film the music was handled very well writers Dick Clement and Ian Le Frenais co wrote THE COMMITMENTS and were behind the music oriented British TV show OVER THE RAINBOW and the songs Strange Fruit played were co written by Foreigner s Mick Jones not to be confused with The Clash s Mick Jones so it was a meeting of people who knew what they were talking about Also two cast members are musicians in their own right Bill Nye I don t know about though the film credits him with his own singing and he certainly looks like a lead singer of that era while Jimmy Nail was in another British TV show which was music oriented though I forget the name and he was in EVITA and the others are convincing at it And while as I said a lot of 70 s bands like Strange Fruit behaved badly towards women the movie doesn t make the same mistake except for the woman who follows Timothy Spall around as the manager of the reunion Juliet Aubrey is quite good and plays a fully rounded character br br The other actors are all good as well with special praise to Stephen Rea who handles the more dramatic role well without sentimentality There are a couple of plot points which don t work but overall this is quite enjoyable Oh yeah and the music is good too
If you need cheering up on a cold weekday evening this is the film for you Excellent script and perfectly cast actors I especially loved Ray psyching himself up in front of the mirror before gigs inspired
So I rented Still Crazy instead When I described Hardcore Logo to the guy at the video store he said that sounded kind of like Still Crazy So I rented it Was I disappointed Well yes as Still Crazy focuses on a classic rock band rather than a punk band but that s OK Still Crazy tells the story of the Strange Fruit a rock band that broke up in the 70s at the peak of their popularity at a large rock festival Twenty years later the band members are all struggling to make a living and are offered the opportunity to play a concert at the twenty year anniversary of this festival They take up the offer and decide to reform on a permanent basis touring Europe in the process Some quite funny hijinks ensue and all the characters go through subtle changes Watching this movie you feel more like a viewer of a carefully edited documentary than a participant And that s not bad at all
What happens to washed up rock n roll stars in the late 1990 s They launch a comeback reunion tour At least that s what the members of Strange Fruit a fictional 70 s stadium rock group do br br Tony Stephen Rea has the concession on condom vending machines when he runs into the son of the promoter of a famous music festival It was at that festival in the 70 s that Strange Fruit broke up The 70 s are retro and the time is right to wide that wave He sets off in search of the other members of the band br br Part of what broke up the band was the death and replacement of Keith the lead singer and brilliant song writer The band was known for its excessive lifestyle and now they are all back amongst the working class from which they came Beano the drummer played by Timothy Spall who was brilliant in Secrets and Lies is a layabout the bass player is a roofer and their lead singer is still a rocker While he owns a huge mansion he has been forced to sell it as his fortune has not lasted Brian the lead guitarist is dead so a young guitarist is hired to replace him br br Somewhat reluctantly the band agree to give the reunion a try Abandoning their day jobs they begin to rehearse and their manager approaches their label about reissuing their albums But he wants them to start touring again first And so they hit the club circuit around Europe The club scene is not kind to these overweight dated old rockers br br It is on tour that the film really starts to develop All of the old conflicts rearise with the figures of Keith and Brian hovering throughout They all hang together because they are all in search of a second chance for the greatness that eluded them earlier And they rediscover some of the interpersonal chemistry that made playing together so enjoyable br br Still Crazy starts as Spinal Tap II but gradually becomes a more dramatically focused film following the relationships of the band members While it is still a very funny movie it is the evolving characters struggling to deal with the deaths of Brian and Keith and with their own personal demons that make the film work
This reminded me of Spinal Tap on a more serious level It s the story of a band doing a reunion tour but things are not harmonious between them I was especially impressed with the performance of Bill Nighy as Ray You felt sorry for him yet he had a certain creepiness about him It s a great movie to watch if you have ever seen your favorite band get wrinkly old and pathetic Bittersweet highly recommended
Contrary to most reviews I ve read I didn t feel this followed any of the other rock movies Spinal Tap etc The story was more unique although I feel most people wanted to see the sex drugs rock and roll vices that the band kept alluding to br br As an American I knew a few of the actors Spall Connelly Rea Surprised to find out Brian Bruce Robinson was in Zifferedi s sp classic Romeo Juliet Guess I ll have to rent that next br br THE FLAME STILL BURNS My wife who hails from Mexico didn t follow the English British language too well missed some of the jokes which I dutifully explained but she cried her eyes out at the concert scene She loves the song so much now br br Funny that Amazon com has the soundtrack for 30 usd when I bought the DVD in the bargain bin at Wal Mart for 5 50usd Price non withstanding I first saw this on late night cable and have been dying to find it ever since
The funky yet strictly second tier British glam rock band Strange Fruit breaks up at the end of the wild n wacky excess ridden 70 s The individual band members go their separate ways and uncomfortably settle into lackluster middle age in the dull and uneventful 90 s morose keyboardist Stephen Rea winds up penniless and down on his luck vain neurotic pretentious lead singer Bill Nighy tries and fails to pursue a floundering solo career paranoid drummer Timothy Spall resides in obscurity on a remote farm so he can avoid paying a hefty back taxes debt and surly bass player Jimmy Nail installs roofs for a living Former loving groupie turned patient understanding long suffering manager Juliet Aubrey gets the group back together for an ill advised largely ineffectual and hilariously disastrous twenty years later nostalgic reunion tour of Europe Our lovably ragged bunch try gamely but fumblingly to reignite a flame that once burned quite brightly back in the day Scraggly zonked out roadie Billy Connelly and cocky eager beaver young guitarist Hans Matheson tag along for the delightfully bumpy trouble plagued but still ultimately rewarding and enjoyable ride br br Director Brian Gibson shows tremendously infectious respect and adoration for both his amiably screwy characters in particular and loud ringing flamboyantly overblown preening 70 s rock in general this imbuing this affectionate little pip with an utterly engaging sense of big hearted charm and tireless verve The astute sharply written script by Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais likewise bristles with spot on dry wit and finely observed moments of joyous on the road inanity capturing a certain bittersweetly affecting and frequently uproarious vibe that gives the picture itself an irresistibly luminescent glow Ashley Rowe s lovely elegant cinematography ensures that the movie always looks quite visually sumptuous while the perfectly catchy and groovy music does the trick with right on rockin flair and aplomb Kudos also to the across the board terrific performances that vividly nail the burnt out soul and tattered but still fiercely beating heart of a past its prime has been ragtag rock outfit desperate to regain its erstwhile evanescent glory in one final bid for big time success All in all this radiant and touching gem rates highly as one of the true seriocomic sleeper treats from the 90 s
I m 60 years old a guitarist lead rhythm and over the last forty years I ve been in four bands it s all there the fights the foul ups the rotten food the worse accommodation always travelling little or no money and every one was drunk or high But the clubs the fans and the music made it all worth it Just like Strange Fruit I m too damn old for it now and the arthritis in the hands and hips mean no more rocking but for the length of that video it all came back and it was all there The birds the brawls and the booze And I was young again It s just like Billy Connolly s voice over God likes that 70 s stuff Rock On Forever
Heads Hands and Feet a band from the past just like Strange Fruit A triple whammy there Those who have professed not to like this film are either heartless or under 40 and have had no experience of the real thing Sad for them This is an achingly well observed little picture that is an excellent way of passing an hour or two and will probably not even fade much on the second showing Stephen Rae Timothy Spall as the fat drummer in many ways quite the most delightful figure of all and Bill Nighy a new name for me as the neurotic vocalist and front man all turn in super performances and Juliet Aubrey has lovely doe eyes to go with some sharp acting as Karen who tries to hold the band together as they spectacularly self destruct br br The Syd Barrett Brian Wilson echoes are loud and clear Mott the Hoople rear up before one in all their inflated ridiculousness and the script is never mawkish for more than a minute Don t compare this with Spinal Tap or The Rutles or The Full Monty it s unfair on all of them The nearest comparison is The Commitments and that s no bad thing And any film that can conjure up memories of Blodwyn Pig a band I do not remember ever seeing but the name lives on well it shows somebody in the team knew what they were on about br br A small delight and thanks for the memory br br Oh and I ve got ANOTHER one Stiff Little Fingers a a and what about SteelEYE Span Spooky TOOTH Ten Inch NAILS anyone You have to see the movie or have been on the road
This is perhaps the best rockumentary ever a British better This Is Spinal Tap The characters are believable the plot is great and you can genuinely empathise with some of the events such as Ray s problem with fitting in the band br br The soundtrack is excellent Real period stuff even if it is in the same key you ll be humming some of the songs for days What I liked was the nearly all British cast with some of the favourite household names Ray s wife is priceless br br The film never drags it just goes at the right pace and has some genuinely funny sections in it A generator of some really good catchphrases br br It s a hidden diamond
What a good movie At last a picture revealing a unknown side of rock illusions of fame Well known Rockers are getting old and forgotten not the music And with a good sense of humour Have you ever danced on Bill Haley s Rock Around the Clock br br Anyway Still Crazy is probably the best movie about rock n roll I have ever seen Far much better than Spinal Tap for instance Why Because in Still Crazy people are mature They have a different point of view about rock about love and about life They want to catch up with their crazy youth they miss so much Beyond the story itself we see characters with their own personality weaknesses and dreams Like anyone of us br br Spend a good time watching this listen to the awesome soundtrack and finally thinking of your own future br br Bye
I found Still Crazy to be marvelously entertaining and not only to those of us who lived through that raucous era of late 60s early 70s rock My 15 year old daughter watches it with me every time I drag out the DVD don t worry it s only been three times and she loves it too br br It is a truly loving poignant and hilarious nod to the era and every actor hits his her notes with perfection It was my first introduction to Bill Nighy and I am glad his somewhat similar turn in Love Actually brought him more attention Bruce Robinson was incredible as Brian bringing real life to what could have been a caricature of the drug damaged rocker stereotype It was interesting to see that Robinson has made quite a name for himself as a writer br br I live in Sherman Oaks California and after the first time I saw the movie I bumped into Billy Connolly at the local mall he lived here at the time and told him it was one of my five favorite films of all time He invited me to sit down at the food court with him and we discussed the movie for some time We even talked of the idea of an American oriented remake before wisely dismissing that Why mess with the original br br My only problem with Still Crazy is that it wasn t hugely popular in theaters and too many people have missed out on a wonderful experience
Hello I was alanrickmaniac I m a Still Crazy holic It was just another movie I watched partly on TV Then I had to get the video tape to finally find out how it ends Then I wanted the DVD because the tape showed first signs of decay after a few weeks After the DVD I had to lay my hands on the soundtrack Then on several film posters and the film script Right now it has become that worse that I try to push other people into addiction with my website and Still Crazy parties br br How could that happen What drove me into addiction br br OK it s one of those funny but somehow sad and melancholic intelligent comedies like only the British can produce br br Alright the movie is worlds apart from stuff like This Is Spinal Tap because of the characters that aren t childish or ultra cool but real This is a story about men getting older too A story about men getting along with each other Or don t It contains some of the best actors possible Tim Spall Stephen Rea Bruce Robinson Jimmy Nail And Bill Nighy Bill Nighy who puts on one of the best performances I ve ever seen in a film br br Good the soundtrack is unbelievable Foreigner s Mick Jones has written the songs for the imaginary band Strange Fruit Jimmy Nail who plays bass man Les Wickes and Bill Nighy portraying the egocentric but awkward singer Ray Simms are really singing We know that about Jimmy Nail but if you ve only heard Bill Nighy s singing in Love Actually you have no idea how great and powerful his voice is br br Well you ll fever for every scene to come for the x th time especially those concert scenes You d die to be able to really stand in the dancing crowd when Strange Fruit is doing All Over The World singing on the top of your lungs You long to cry and celebrate with thousands of people the rebirth of the real Strange Fruit at Wisbech s festival stage br br It s hard but I m addicted to this film I m addicted to Strange Fruit If there s a world where this band really exists I d like to move there br br Got Still Crazy anyone
This movie is tremendous for uplifting the Spirits br br Every time I watch it I see hear funny little things that I missed before br br The soundtrack is unbelievable Mick Jones Foreigner and Chris Difford Squeeze penned the songs making Strange Fruit the best thing that ever hit today s music scene br br Unfortunately Strange Fruit are a strictly fictitional washed up 60 s to 70 s band that were never good to begin with due to drug use and inner fighting One wonders what might have been while listening to their fanatstic soundtrack br br The Fruit draw inspiration from The Rolling Stones Deep Purple David Bowie and The Who br br Each member of Fruit are quite memorable Stephen Rea stars as down and dead broke Tony Costello who is asked by a festival promoter to reunite his band for a reunion tour with hopes of reaping monetary benefits Costello haply approaches ex roadie Karen Knowles played by Juliet Aubrey to help him rekindle the flame of a dream long past br br Juliet gathers up the bitter Jimmy Nail Les Wickes blundering Timothy Spall David Beano Baggot and extravagantly glamouresque Ray Simms Bill Nighy Tumbling in is another ex roadie the hippy toker jokester Hughie Billy Connolly who never let the flame burn out br br As Juliet searches for the last member of their motley band the elusive guitarist songwriter Brian Lovell played by the brooding Bruce Robinson the reunited members squabble just like old times fighting over each others rusty talent br br The band is then given the chance to do a small Dutch tour to prepare for the festival With young Hendrix like Luke Shand Hans Matheson taking the place of Lovell the crew hits the road The sparks fly as their memories flame forward threatening to burn their unfinished goals br br Be prepared to laugh sing cheer and cry as these memorable characters etch themselves back into your hearts
This series could very well be the best Britcom ever and that is saying a great deal considering the competitors Fawlty Towers Good Neighbours to name just two br br What made Butterflies so superior even to the best of the best is that it did not just exemplify great classic classy and intelligent comedy but it also expanded horizons reflecting flawlessly gently and at every detail the great social change that was occurring in Britain at the time br br I remember watching this show as a teenager and being in awe of everything about it The lifestyle depicted was remarkable in itself This was the first time I saw real people using cordless phones And the wardrobe of all the characters was far removed from the goofy seventies attire still seen in North America at the time Then there were the decors shop fronts cars These people even the layabout sons with their philosophical approach to life and epigrammatic humor were sophisticated They were examples of the New Europeans that would come to have an impact on life and style throughout the world in the coming decade 1980s br br Of course the premise was strange and fantastic The idea that someone who was living the suburban dream could be so discontent and restless was revolutionary particularly to North Americans for whom happiness was always defined as money and things sure the situation was depicted in American movies and TV but not with the intensity of Butterflies or the movie Montenegro And if the premise was not surprising enough the means by which it was expressed took it to the extreme A potential affair that was not really about sex or even romance Butterflies dazzled many but it must have left some people smacking their foreheads in disbelief at the time anyway br br Butterflies turned out to be in so many ways prophetic It documented ahead of its time post modern ennui all pervasive lifestyle the notion of emotional infidelity and generational disconnect and male discontent portrayed perfectly by the strained father son relationships It is too bad this series has not been rediscovered in a big way and all those involved given credit for creating a meaningful snapshot of a certain time and place and foreseeing all the slickness and angst that was to come
Looking back over the past 28 years since my first exposure to the show all i can say is Once you get it it will stay with you forever I remember my initial reaction being 1 annoyingly overacted 2 under produced 3 unlikeable characters br br Well two years later I watched some episodes again and didn t find it nearly as annoying A year later I was able to catch the entire series from the beginning and quickly became engrossed in it s bittersweet tale of human fault and perspectives on happiness Yes the show has a style that is not for everybody and I m sure the dated production value would be hard to deal with now But I still think about the show at least once a month with a vague teary eyed longing for what seemed like simpler times br br BTW I am a married man for all who think this is a show for females
British comedies tend to fall into one of two main types the quiet introspective usually romantic study and the farcical social satire Settings characters and concepts vary but certain characteristics place the vast majority of shows into one of the two categories Butterflies is perhaps the epitom√© of the first type br br The scripts are very verbal including long interior monologues by the main character Ria a basically happy but unsettled housewife curious about what she might have missed out on when she embarked on a thoroughly conventional life When she meets a successful but clumsy and emotionally accessible businessman who makes his interest in her quite clear she toys with the idea of finding out what the other path might have offered br br The acting and scripts are always on the money which makes one s reaction to the show almost entirely a personal one I was neither blown away by it nor turned off My mother on the other hand adored this show I think the degree to which one identifies with Ria s dilemma is the most important factor in determining one s reaction to Butterflies
Johny To makes here one of his best style exercises making a strong film with a good Yakuza s story The election of the new Yakuza s boss is the beginning of a war inside the organization br br In my opinion the violence is wise used in the context making a very strong gangs film I specially love the way he tells the history moving around all the roles inside the Yakuza s family and making that we see the violence like the only way they have to solve their problems br br Talking about the technical aspects the film is a good example of paused rythmic and planified way of shooting a film One of the Hong Kong Films of the year Is like Infernal affairs but without the easy action violence scenes and the confused storyline Strongly recommended to all Asian films lovers br br sorry for my English better do in Spanish lol
enjoyed the movie and efficient Confucian crime drama the old order survives the threat posed by a brash young greedy man no doubt representing modern society I thought the final scene was strange and could not understand if we were to believe that big D was being punished for being greedy or it was part of the plan a long I loved the scene and for once in a Chinese movie the violence was not a choreographed martial arts fest On thing that always amuses me about HK films is that the main influence the British seem to have had is to introduce yes sir and sorry into the local language and its amusing that long after we have gone they are still there
Not to be confused with the Resse Witherspoon high school film of the same name this is a stylised look at Hong Kong s triad gangs Called election because a new leader or chairman is elected by ancient traditions every two years Two candidates are up for the position and through ego bribes and past track record the race is tense to say the least Expertly directed to introduce you to an expansive cast without ever being confusing the story twists and turns before revealing itself in all its brutal glory The Asian godfather this is not but it is an enjoyable thriller in a gangster genre that will leave you on the edge of your seat and wincing at the violence Subtitled volume 1 I think its safe to say there will other instalments as we go deeper into the murky world of the triads and all their feuding and underhand business deals Either way this is a good start and if there are no sequels a great film in its own right
This isn t as violent as I was expecting which makes the violent scenes appear all the more brutal and effective br br There are a lot of twists and turns and back stabbing and double crossing all the way through the film making it hard to know who s side a particular character is on br br The plot is pacey with some good dialogue and character development and gives an interesting view of the workings of the Triad gang it follows br br The violence when it comes is brutal no guns or martial art scenes with special effects this is believable in your face violence and for all the dialogue you are never allowed forget that the Triad is a violent criminal organisation br br The ending is surprising but thoroughly consistent and believable
There can be no denying that Hak Se Wui Election in English is a well made and well thought out film The film uses numerous clever pieces of identification all the time playing with modernity yet sticking to tradition a theme played with throughout the film Where John Woo s Hong Kong films are action packed and over the top in their explosive content as seen in Hard Boiled 1992 and when Hong Kong films do settle down into rhythms of telling the story from the bad point of view they can sometimes stutter and just become merely unmemorable a good example being City on Fire 1987 br br Election is a film that is memorable for the sheer fact of its unpredictable scenes spontaneous action and violence that are done in a realistic and tasteful if that s the right word manner as well as the clever little in pieces of film making It s difficult to spot during the viewing but Election is really constructed in a kind of three act structure there is the first point of concern involving the actual election and whoever is voted in is voted in not everyone likes the decision but what the Uncles say goes The second act is the retrieving of the ancient baton from China that tradition demands must be present during the inauguration with the final third the aftermath of the inauguration and certain characters coming up with their own ideas on how the Triads should and could be run Needless to say certain events and twists occur during each of the three thirds some are small and immaterial whereas some are much larger and spectacular br br Election does have some faults with the majority coming in the opening third Trying to kill off time surrounding an election that only takes a few minutes to complete was clearly a hard task for the writers and filmmakers and that shows at numerous points I got the feeling that a certain scene was just starting to go somewhere before it was interrupted by the police and then everyone gets arrested This happens a few times a fight breaks out in a restaurant but the police are there and everyone is arrested there s a secret meeting about the baton between the Triads but the police show up and everyone gets arrested some other Triads are having a pre election talk but the police show up and guess what You know br br Once the film gets out of that rut that I thought it would it uses a sacred baton as a plot device to get everybody moving The baton spawns some good fight scenes such as the chasing of a truck after it s been hotwired another chase involving a motorbike and a kung fu fight with a load of melee weapons in a street the scenes are unpredictable realistic and violent but like I said they are in a tasteful manner Where Election really soars is its attention to that fine detail When the Triads are in jail the bars are covered with wire suggesting they re all animals in cages as that s how they behave on the outside when in conflict Another fine piece of attention to detail is the way the Uncles toast using tea and not alcohol elevating themselves above other head gangsters who d use champagne The Long Good Friday and also referencing Chinese tradition of drinking tea to celebrate or commemorate br br Election is a good film that is structured well enough to enjoy and a film that has fantastic mise en scene as you look at what s going on Some of the indoor settings and the clothing as well as the buckets of style that is poured on as the search and chase for the baton intensifies The inauguration is like another short film entirely and very well integrated into the film hinting at Chinese tradition in the process I feel the best scene is the ending scene as it sums it up perfectly two shifty characters fishing and debating the ruling of the Triads all the while remaining realistic unpredictable and violent in a tasteful manner of course
Election is a Chinese mob movie or triads in this case Every two years an election is held to decide on a new leader and at first it seems a toss up between Big D Tony Leung Ka Fai or as I know him The Other Tony Leung and Lok Simon Yam who was Judge in Full Contact Though once Lok wins Big D refuses to accept the choice and goes to whatever lengths he can to secure recognition as the new leader Unlike any other Asian film I watch featuring gangsters this one is not an action movie It has its bloody moments when necessary as in Goodfellas but it s basically just a really effective drama There are a lot of characters which is really hard to keep track of but I think that plays into the craziness of it all a bit A 100 year old baton which is the symbol of power I mentioned before changes hands several times before things settle down And though it may appear that the film ends at the 65 or 70 minute mark there are still a couple big surprises waiting Simon Yam was my favorite character here and sort of anchors the picture br br Election was quite the award winner at last year s Hong Kong Film Awards winning for best actor Tony Leung best picture best director Johnny To who did Heroic Trio and best screenplay It also had nominations for cinematography editing film score which I loved and three more acting performances including Yam
First off I must say that I made the mistake of watching the Election films out of sequence I say unfortunately because after seeing Election 2 first Election seems a bit of a disappointment Both films are gangster epics that are similar in form And while Election is an enjoyable piece of cinema it s just not nearly as good as it s sequel br br In the first Election installment we are shown the two competitors for Chairman Big D and Lok After a few scenes of discussion amongst the Uncle s as to who should have the Chairman title they almost unanimously decide That Lok Simon Yam will helm the Triads Suffice to say this doesn t go over very well with competitor Big D Tony Leung Ka Fai and in a bid to influence the takeover Big D kidnaps two of the uncles in order to sway the election board to his side This has disastrous results and heads the triads into an all out war Lok is determined to become Chairman but won t become official until he can recover the Dragon Head Baton a material representation of the Chairman s power The current Chairman Whistle Chung Wang has hidden the baton somewhere in mainland China and the race is on to see who can recover it first br br Much of the film is devoted to the recovery of the Baton As both aspiring leaders search for it they must dodge cops and opposite sides which leads into one of the stand out scenes in Election which involves an underling named Jet Nick Cheung a machete and lots of bad guys Nick Cheung s presence is attention grabbing to say the least I wonder if this influenced director Johhnie To in any way while making the second Election as he does deliver more of Jet s character in the sequel br br While Nick Cheung gives a scene stealing performance I must not fail to give due to the rest of the film s actors Election has a great ensemble cast with well thought out performances that are both subtle and impacting Simon Yam is his usually glorious self and the film also benefits from heavyweight HK actors like Louis Koo Tony Leung Ka Fai and the under appreciated Suet Lam There really aren t any weak links in the acting and one could easily believe that they re watching real gangsters br br Although the performances are great one of the most impressive things about Election is Johnnie To s eye for the camera There are some truly striking shots in the film and it goes without saying that To definitely knows how to frame his shots as the viewer is treated to a series of innovative and quite brilliant camera placings and angles All of which makes Election above all a great looking film br br My issues with the film arises mostly out of the shear amount of characters involved in Election It gets a bit hard to follow because the film is so full of characters that aren t integral to the plot While the sequel opts to focus more on the two candidates the first Election offers the election process as a whole with tons of Uncles underlings and police officers crowding the storyline Maybe the film would have worked better if it would have been a bit longer with more time dedicated to the inner workings of the Triad or if Director Johnnie To would have funneled down the necessary elements and expounded on them more br br Bottom Line All in all this is a wonderfully brutal film with a great cast excellent direction and leisurely pacing that packs a punch It s just a little more complicated than it needed to be
It might be a little erroneous to open a review by describing a film in terms of other films but I think it s the best way to give an approximation of the place Election occupies in the gangster genre arena It works somewhere in between The Godfather and Kinji Fukasaku s yakuza opus The Yakuza Papers AKA Battles Without Honour and Humanity in that it is simultaneously both romanticized and realistic dark and gritty But it s also a Johnnie To film and as such it carries the distinct touch of the Hong Kong auteur br br Every two years the HK Triad elects a new boss Only this time one of the candidates is not overly happy with the result so he decides to take matters into his own hands much to the dismay of the rest of the Triads and the police That s the story in a nutshell but rest assured it has a lot more going for it than that As in The Yakuza Papers there s a great deal of scheming back stabbing and forming and switching of allegiances sometimes all it takes is a phone call in one of the most memorable scenes I ve seen in recent time which might not necessarily make for deep drama but makes for an interesting plot and good character conflict Fans of the gangster genre are likely to appreciate it in that aspect Election is not as action oriented as one might expect although it IS violent And I m not talking about the glossy glamour version of Hollywood violence This is dark and grim To s camera lingers in the scenes of people being brutalized in ways that reveal both the humanity and inhumanity of the perpetrators and victims after all violence IS an integral part of us whether we like it or not br br If you re familiar with To s style then you should know what to expect The pacing is relatively slow and deliberate The cinematography is great slick and dark in equal measures utilizing dark hues brown dark green and orange while the smooth tracking shots add a vibrant quality to it In the end Election occupies a peculiar place It s not exactly a character study and it s not an action oriented gangster film It explores a situation the election and its aftermath but does so in style and is both realistic and romanticized the Triad ceremonies in particular echo of an oriental Godfather
This movie is great fun to watch if you love films of the organized crime variety Those looking for a crime film starring a charismatic lead with dreams of taking over in a bad way may be slightly disappointed with the way this film strides br br It is a fun romp through a criminal underworld however and if you aren t familiar with Hong Kong films then you may be pleasantly surprised by this one I was somewhat disappointed by some of the choices made story wise but overall a good crime film Some things did not make sense but that seems to be the norm with films of the East br br People just randomly do things regardless of how their personalities were set up prior It s a slightly annoying pattern that permeates even in this film
Johnnie To s ELECTION has some cool music on the opening credits and a nice opening credits design too a kaleidoscope of Chinese characters and those Asian mobsters solemnly taking an oath or uttering some sacred stuff as a matter of fact the whole flick is nicely scored I have found about To from Bishop Seraphim Sigrist and was quite eager to see a To movie The one with which I began ELECTION is exciting and interesting and only moderately violent by nowadays standards moderately and also essentially violent the story of an Asian godfather s scheming it uses a puzzle play of elements violent facts from the mobsters lives the race for the scepter true details and as with Coppola we are expected to believe that some of the morally glamorized mobsters are entitled and nice and likable The performances are reasonably amusing and colorful br br ELECTION is well made in the enjoyable somewhat careless style of the Hong Kong fare the ending is bitter true straight and will scare the kids
I spotted in the guide to films list for the Santa Barbara Film Festival where I went when I was in Hollywood that this film was in screening Basically there is an election for the new chairman of the Hong Kong Triads Wo Sing Society coming up so you can imagine how much violence that is going to occur during this The struggle is between candidates Lam Lok Simon Yam and Big D Tony Leung Ka Fai for control of the oldest and most powerful Triad parts of the society Also starring Louis Koo as Jimmy Lee Nick Cheung as Jet Cheung Siu Fai as Mr So Lam Suet as Big Head and Lam Ka Tung as Kun There are some good realistic corruption themes and moments just about enough action apart from maybe when the cops get involved but a sequel followed so it s a pretty worthwhile crime drama thriller Very good
I always thought this would be a long and boring Talking Heads flick full of static interior takes dude I was wrong Election is a highly fascinating and thoroughly captivating thriller drama taking a deep and realistic view behind the origins of Triads Rituals Characters are constantly on the move and although as a viewer you kinda always remain an outsider it s still possible to feel the suspense coming from certain decisions and ambitions of the characters Furthermore Johnnie To succeeds in creating some truly opulent images due to meticulously composed lighting and atmospheric light shadow contrasts Although there s hardly any action the ending is still shocking in it s ruthless depicting of brutality Cool movie that deserves more attention and I came to like the minimalistic acoustic guitar score quite a bit
The first of two films by Johnny To this film won many awards but none so prestigious as a Cannes Golden Palm nomination br br The Triad elects their leader but it is far from democratic with the behind the scenes machinations br br Tony Leung Ka Fai Zhou Yu s Train Ashes of Time Redux is Big D who plans to take the baton no matter what it takes even if it means a war Well war is not going to happen as that is bad for business Big D will change his tune or br br Good performances by Simon Yam Louis Koo and Ka Tung Lam Infernal Affairs I III along with Tony Leung Ka Fai br br Whether Masons made men in the Mafia or members of the Wo Sing Society the ceremonies are the same fascinating to watch br br To be continued
Personally I find the movie to be quite a good watch It outlines the actual situation of triads in Hong Kong and gives the viewer a glimpse of how triads are organized br br Not only that it also shows the viewer how the Hong Kong police control the triad situation and why the police don t just go all out and wipe out triads br br Overall the movie is rather violent due to the gangland methods of killings torture Nevertheless the movie stays true to the real world thus the violence on screen is just a reflection of what really happens br br I d recommend this movie to any Triad Mafia movie fan Another good watch would be Dragon Squad That movie has more guns than this as in this movie there s more knives than guns in fact I don t remember seeing a single gun
Despite a tight narrative Johnnie To s Election feels at times like it was once a longer picture with many characters and plot strands abandoned or ultimately unresolved Some of these are dealt with in the truly excellent and far superior sequel Election 2 Harmony is a Virtue but it s still a dependably enthralling thriller about a contested Triad election that bypasses the usual shootouts and explosions though not the violence in favour of constantly shifting alliances that can turn in the time it takes to make a phone call It s also a film where the most ruthless character isn t always the most threatening one as the chilling ending makes only too clear one can imagine a lifetime of psychological counselling being necessary for all the trauma that one inflicts on one unfortunate bystander br br Simon Yam all too often a variable actor but always at his best under To s direction has possibly never been better in the lead not least because Tony Leung s much more extrovert performance makes his stillness more the powerful
Election marks the 2nd trial society theme movie directed by Johnnie To br br To marvellously casted Simon Yan and Tony Leung Kar Fai as Lok and Big D as the two trial members who were chosen as candidates for the position of chairman for Ho Sing society a 100 year old trial society br br While Lok is a man who keeps his cool at all times Big D is not only impatient but also thinks that he is on top of everything Lok was chosen as the next chairman for 2 years To have the total control of the gang the newly elected chairman must be passed down with a Dragon Baton which represents power and authority Big D was extremely unhappy with the results that he was not chosen to be the next chairman after paying a handsome figure of bribes to the council members He ordered his man to get the Baton before it falls onto the hands of Lok br br While Big D is getting the Baton Lok has other plans for him br br This is one of the trial society theme movies where not much bloodshed is needed Johnnie To puts the greed of the human beings in the movie where bloodshed is commonly used in other trial society theme movies to show how the greed of human beings can caused the death or the downfall of one However no single bullet is used hardly any gangfights are involved in Election It s the battle of the wits that makes Election stands out of the rest br br Apart from Maggie Shiu the only actress in Election with less than 5 lines to talk in the whole movie masculinity rules the whole movie Louis Koo and Nick Cheung who was seen in To s previous film are casted as an undercover cop and a gangster who sold his life to the gang respectively Together with some of the veteran actors making their appearance in the film and the excellent script it makes the only HK movie to represent Cannes Fil Festival 2005 br br Election has hardly failed any critics who wants an different trial society theme movie
This film really deserves more recognition than its getting It really is a stunning and rich portrayal of blood ties favours and allegiances within the crime world The film is shot beautifully and delves into all you re classic crime themes such as betrayal and power This film is a movie goers film it requires attention and understanding and rewards fully in the end It is the godfather of hong kong and is a welcome change rather than another wire frame fighting martial arts epic which seems to be the major contribution to the cinema world from hong kong and china It features an arrangement of great characters actors and development although is fair to say I had to watch it twice just to nail what was happening with some of the characters due to their being so many interactions in the film ALl in all 8 10 Great plot characters but there are characters that don t stand out enough and the music didn t really get me going and at times i felt it didn t sync well with the action there is action by the way so it loses some points for that
br br I must admit I was expecting something quite different from my first viewing of Cut last night though was delighted with the unexpected Australian horror gem I am a true horror fan as true as they come and found Cut to not only be the best of the genre Australia has ever produced but one of the great parody comedy films of late br br My only concern is that mainstream audiences may not pick up on a lot of the comedic elements the film was not overly clever in it s application but made me laugh at every turn trying to fit in EVERY possible cliche of the horror genre they could I am certain this was intended as humour hoping this was intended as humour br br And of course there was the gore br br The use of the customised garden shears was brilliance besides the expected stabs and slashes In short there was a huge amount of variety and creativity in the many violent deaths enough to please even the skeptics of this films worth br br The appearance of both Kylie Minogue short that her appearance was and Molly Ringwald was just another reason to see the film both performances were fantastic as well as Simon Bossell The Castle in a brilliant role as the jokey technician br br All in all I think this movie is one of the best horror products of the last couple or years as well as a beautiful satire parody toungue in cheek till the very end br br Loved it Go see it
Australia s first mainstream slasher film hits the screen with a bang And a stab And a slice And a scream or two And plenty of blood frights red herrings and lots of laughs br br In fact there s lots of first surrounding Cut it s the first script of Dave Warner s to be produced although he has several others either optioned or in negotiation it s the first major film from director and former Hoodoo Guru Kimble Rendall and it s also the first film for producer Martin Fabinyi And for a bunch of guys dipping their toes into this genre for the first time they sure know their stuff br br Cut tells the story of a bunch of Australian film students who hear about a slasher film Hot Blooded that was never finished because its director Hilary Kylie Minogue was killed by the actor playing the psycho killer in the film br br Despite their lecturer who was assistant director on the night Hilary died warning them that whenever someone tries to start up production of Hot Blooded again someone dies director Raffy Jessica Napier and producer Hester Sarah Kants decide to go ahead and complete the film They put together a crew and manage to get the original star Vanessa Turnbill Molly Ringwald to return to Australia in fact to the original location to complete Hot Blooded 14 years after shooting shut down br br Of course this being a slasher film lots of bloodletting ensues long with plenty of laughs a few good scares and a rocking Aussie soundtrack Cut shows that Australia can make a good mass market horror film just as well as Hollywood br br It s a finely crafted feature with excellent special effects a taut plot and a killer Scarman that s a welcome addition to the ranks of Michael Jason and Freddy
I was really excited about seeing this film I thought finally Australia had made a good film but I was wrong br br This was the most pathetic attempt at a slasher film ever I feel sorry for Molly Ringwald having to come all the way to Australia to make an awful movie br br The acting was terrible especially that Australian guy who was trying to speak in an American accent and the plot was also pretty bad br br When I first heard about this film coming out I thought that the title was pathetic because it sounds like the cheesy film Stab in Scream 2 but I was willing to let it slide if it was a good movie br br WARNING MAJOR SPOILERS br br Probably the worst thing about the film was the ending I was expecting a big surprise about who the killer was but the killer wasn t even human which turned this realistic slasher film into an awful horror movie br br Don t see this film you ll probably be disappointed
I saw this movie with a bunch of friends and although only two of us walked out of the cinema thinking how cool it was the others just laughed and commented on how stupid it was Well that was because it isn t supposed to be taken so seriously basically it is a a movie that mocks horror flicks and does a damn good job There seems to be another movie coming out like that too umm Scary Movie Well this is Aussie and original Jessica Napier does a surperb performance and Sarah Kants has a definate bright future in acting I hope to see more of them Molly Ringwald was a good move and Kylie was an even better move The Impossible Princess was Queen of the screen I recommend seeing this flick as you ll be guessing until the very end the connection with Raffy Hilary and The movie that never got finished 20 years ago
Personally I enjoyed Cut thouroughly It was the first time I ve seen a theatrically release Australian slasher flick A genre normally restricted to the mainstream hollywood films br br With all the usual cooky comedies and dramas coming out of Australia I loved being able to see a homegrown horror movie that wasn t a rip off of anything I didn t even think it was really a spoof of other movies It was a supernaturally theme horror like Nightmare on Elm Street not Scream or I know What You Did Last Summer and therefore there was more of a suspension of disbelief I think it s about time Australian films tried to get more into the mainstream genres br br Cut was original scary enough and ultimately just a bit of fun I d give it seven out of ten and wouldn t treat it as anything serious It did what I expected it to do entertain and scare me enough times to be satisfying I enjoyed it
I have been wanting to see cut since the day i have heard of it which was sometime last year Anyway i got to see today and when the movie started i thought that it started rather week but it got better after 10 mins or so I thought that the movie was pretty good but the thing i didn t like was how the killer was created i was thinking just before i rented that it would probably suck just like Urban legends final cut i almost died it mostly everything in UL final cut needed to be improved CUT is 100 times better than UL final cut The best part of CUT is the killer and the death scenes The killer kicks MO F ING ASS br br i give cut a 8 out of 10
It isn t the worst film ever made the actors aren t apalling and the script and director are not completely inept br br It isn t the best film ever made the actors aren t excellent and the script and director are not completely brilliant br br It falls somewhere in the middle A fun somewhere An enjoyable well constructed somewhere br br No need to say don t take it seriously or so bad its good or it wasn t scary None of these comments are relevant br br Cut has atmosphere It s that atmosphere which is actually very unique and the one really original aspect of the movie which personally is what makes the film for me
Cut is a full tilt spoof of the slasher genre and in the main it achieves what it sets out to do Most of the standard slasher cliches are there the old creepy house the woods the anonymous indestructible serial killer buckets of gore and of course the couple interrupted by the killer while they re having sex that s hardly a spoiler br br The set up is simplicity itself film school nerds set out to complete an unfinished slasher masterpiece unfinished because of the murders of a couple of the cast This also neatly okay messily disposes of Kylie Minogue in the first reel They are joined by one of the survivors of the original film played by Molly Ringwald who absolutely steals the film because she gets all the best lines The rest of the cast fit their roles well especially the lovely Jessica Napier who plays it straight while the mayhem and gore erupt around her br br There are plenty of red herrings and fake suspenseful moments and there is very little time to try to work out who the killer is because the film moves at such a fast pace It also has an appropriate low budget look including some clumsy editing which is probably deliberate Good soundtrack too If there is a difficulty with this film it is deciding whether it is a send up of or a homage to the slasher genre Probably a bit of both
This is not a bad movie It follows the new conventions of modern horror that is the movie within a movie the well known actress running for her life in the first scene This movie takes the old convention of a psycho killer on he loose and manage to do something new and interesting with it It is also always nice to see Molly Ringwald back for the attack br br So this might be an example of what the genre has become Cut hits all the marks and is actually scary in some parts I liked it I gave it an eight
This is surprisingly above average slasher that s enjoyable and well made with some decent gore All the characters are decent and the story is quite fun plus Molly Ringwald played the annoying bitch extremely well I bought this at a pawn shop for a 1 and it was surprisingly worth it and the special effects were pretty damn good for the budget plus I loved the mask the killer wore as it was actually somewhat creepy The finale was really cool as I loved how they defeated the killer and the ending while predictable was very amusing as well plus all the characters except for Ringwald were surprisingly pretty likable It s decently made and written and I thought it was quite creative and original at times as well plus some of the death scenes were very impressive This killer didn t mess around and I loved it and Slasher fans like myself should really enjoy this film plus The opening was really wicked too with them filming the movie This is a surprisingly above average slasher that s enjoyable and well made with some decent gore and I say it s well worth the watch The Direction is good Kimble Rendall does a good job here with solid camera work using a creepy setting good angles and keeping the film at a fast moving pace The acting is solid Molly Ringwald plays the bitch extremely well and I had troubles feeling sorry for her after all she was supposed to be the heroine she turned out better towards the end but not by much I m surprised she decided to do this film nonetheless she did an excellent job Frank Roberts is fantastic as the killer he is menacing creepy and had one hell of a mask and this guy didn t mess around he was fantastic Kylie Minogue plays a bitch very well in her small role Jessica Napier is cute and does fine as the other heroine Rest of the cast are fine Overall well worth the watch out of 5
for a slasher flick this movie is actually better than a lot in the genre yes it is predictable resident nut job goes on killing spree people die yada yada yada however there are some good positives in this film first off i really liked the mask the nut job wore it is definitely creepy to say the least and possibly unique although i haven t watched every single slasher film ever made also the genesis of the bad due is something i haven t seen before and he way he finally meets his end is a novel concept as far as i know i also really liked the weapon of choice employed by Mr sicko for most of the murders the murders themselves are not as graphic as most in the genre but that a small concern the movie does not take itself seriously which is something most slashers suffer from oddly enough while watching the movie i was reminded of the early Friday the 13th films which did take themselves seriously there are a few concerns about this movie in several scenes the killer suddenly bears a strong resemblance to one of our horror icons by this i mean his movements and his reactions upon being shot and also the way he walked of bigger concern however is a scene very close to the end where Mr crazy bears a more than striking resemblance actually a complete rip off of another famous horror titan and in the very last scenes we have our scumbag once again looking exactly like the 1st horror icon i mentioned in fact that last scene is almost a complete rip off from another icon in the slasher genre these scenes were weak and unoriginal obviously by the way the movie is set in Australia so if you re a sucker for a chick with an Aussie accent like me you ll be in heaven if you not than it just might grate on you one other great thing about this movie beautiful Kylie Minogoue just don t get too attached to her there is one non Aussie accent courtesy of Molly Ringwald overall there are more reasons to watch than not i enjoyed it and had some fun so i have to give Cut 8 10 which may seem too high to some people
Twelve years ago production stopped on the slasher flick Hot Blooded since almost everyone on the set started dying Now a couple of film students have decided to finish the film despite the fact that there s a rumor that the film is cursed Well they re about to find out that some curses are real br br When Scream was released every country seemed to want to cash in on its success even Australia The concept which today has been done to death a slasher film within a slasher film was at the time relatively cool and original This movie was released right before Urban Legends Final Cut and Scream 3 well not in the US but in Australia so it felt like the first movie with this concept When Urban Legends 2 was released most of us had all ready grown sick of the concept and since the movie wasn t even good the movie flopped disastrously Now Cut is not the best slasher flick ever and nor does it try to be It knows that it s a rip off and they even cast a girl who looks like a blonde version of Neve Campbell in the starring role But instead of trying to add some new and original twists to the story they ve decided to rip off some 80s slasher flicks like Nightmare on Elm Street as well and surprisingly enough this actually works The killer is very creepy and that mask is just killer And instead of trying to scare the audience to death they ve created a very good and creepy atmosphere which keeps us in suspense through most of the movie There are a couple of plot holes in the movie though that I wasn t able to fully ignore the ending being the biggest plot hole in the movie Spoiler ahead I mean they burnt the only copy of the movie so where the hell did they find the print that they show in the final scene It makes no sense I tell you End of spoilers All in all Cut is a pretty creepy slasher flick with a silly story but I consider this to be one of the better Scream rip offs that never made it big I m surprised that this one never got a sequel but I guess it simply came out too late br br Suspenseful Australian slasher flick with very few scares Cut is still a pretty neat slasher movie and I will have to recommend this one even though I consider the story to be quite silly since it s completely ludicrous
When I think of the cheesiest guilty pleasure type movies the first thing I think of are 80s slasher flicks Really bad slasher flicks The formulaic type of film where all a script needed was 2 parts blood and several parts nudity to get made br br Flash forward to the late 90s early 00s The slasher flick has been revitalized with the success of 1996 s Scream Like in the 80s these films were formulaic masking a lack of inspiration by labelling themselves as hip tongue in cheek parodies of the original slasher flicks Of this recent blend of hip parody neo slasher flicks the only one worth seeing is the low budget direct to video Cut br br Like most of the other new slasher flicks Cut relies on the production of a slasher flick in this case a fictional 1985 film Hot Blooded to make its commentary on the genre Hot Blooded never finished production because of killings by someone wearing the mask of the film s killer Scarman a bald figure with its mouth stitched close and dark pupil less eyes Now 12 years later a group of film students whose professor was involved in the production have decided to go into the vaults tap the original surviving actress and finish the film But every time the film is screened or a scene is shot Scarman returns and someone dies To quote the tagline will they finish the film before it finishes them br br This all sounds really bad and to a degree it is really is there such a thing as a good slasher flick There is no character development the new director is revealed to be the daughter of Hot Blooded s original director whose life was apparently ruined after the production was cancelled this would ve been a perfect detail to be worked into the plot yet it s never mentioned again and like in all other slasher flicks there are just too many bodies to care about The actors aren t great even by direct to video standards but most are having fun with their characters and for those who aren t it s inadvertent character acting since none of their characters in the film wanted to work on Hot Blooded particularly whoever was lucky enough to play Scarman Cut s climax has no big who dunnit unmasking of the killer like in the Scream films It doesn t have the gimmick killings of the Urban Legend films What it does have is an original and interesting concept that is diluted by a this way we can write a sequel if it sells well ending But that s par for the course br br By any sensible viewing standards this is a horrible movie that should be avoided but this quality is what makes it true to its roots in the slasher genre and this is what makes it more enjoyable than any of the other neo slasher flicks
A horror movie is being shot and things aren t going well It s about a masked killer The director tells off the killer in front of the cast and crew He goes crazy and kills two people He s killed himself and the film is never finished Twelve years later a bunch of film students decide to try and finish it but there s a curse People who try and finish it are killed themselves The students ignore that Guess what happens next br br The plot is old hat but this isn t bad for what it is a low budget slasher film It s well made with a young and fairly talented young cast No one is great but no one is terrible either It also avoids the obligatory and needless female nude scenes It moves quickly the gore is nice and bloody and the script doesn t insult your intelligence Also Molly Ringwald is in this having the time of her life playing a bitchy faded actress br br No great shakes but not bad at all I give it a 7
This is one of those little Christmas movies for everyone Our Scrooge is Ben Affleck who decides money is not enough so he rents the family who lives where he thought HIS family did OK This is a great little high school soap PG 13 but the small sex references are comedy so if your kid can t handle them they can t live in the real world either br br Now Affleck is a hunk and as usual walks through this fun OMG remember when we did ensemble piece as if he were at the end stages of some neuroinfectious disease But that s OK because even this old Oracle keeps hoping that if Ben s that well proportioned all over well there s hope for us ladies yet Luckily the rest of the ensemble Catharine O Hara James Gandolfini Christina Applegate Udo Kier and Josh Zuckerman fill in and keep this shadow side Ozzie and Harriet Christmas alternately hilarious comfortable and warm br br This movie is the kind you can jump up and get popcorn and when you get back everyone wants to back it up to show you what you missed br br This is a happy film after all and it leaves you feeling good about life love family Christmas and Chanel There really IS something for everyone
What s with all the negative comments After having seen this film for the first time tonight I can only say that this is a good holiday comedy that is sure to brighten up any lonely person s day When I saw that Drew Ben Affleck might end up spending the holidays alone I wanted to cry You ll have to see the movie if you want to know why Also even though I liked Tom James Gandolfini and Alicia Christina Applegate after awhile if you ask me they were real snobs However this film did make me smile and feel good inside Before I wrap this up I d like to say that Mike Mitchell has scored a pure holiday hit Now in conclusion I highly recommend this good holiday comedy that is sure to brighten up any lonely person s day to any Ben Affleck or Christina Applegate fan who hasn t seen it
Come on people This movie is better than 4 I can see this happening wealthy people have done crazier things than this And it was funny br br I watch a comedy to be entertained escape from the pressures of the world for a short while and not to have to take anything too seriously This movie fully suits that purpose I judge a movie on its own merits and am not about to compare Surviving Christmas to Blazing Saddles I watched totally dysfunctional people grow into caring likable individuals who could easily live down the street from my home It will remain on my list of favorite must watch for the holiday season If you just want to have a fun 90 minutes watch this one
You can survive Surviving Christmas I thought the television version was a bit edited way down I like Ben Afleck He plays Drew Johnson a family less adult who is willing to pay complete strangers The Valcos starring James Gandolfini and Catherine O Hara as the parents and Christina Applegate as Lisa Valco the daughter Drew is lonely around the holidays because he doesn t have a family of his own so he rents out a family in the Chicago suburbs for a quarter million dollars Bill Macy who I best remember for playing Maude s husband Arthur is hired to play Duda the grandfather When the whole situation comes crashing down the truth can be painful The Valcos household is crumbling apart from the Drew situation Drew s rich girlfriend and her parents make a surprising visit You can t buy what you wish for The acting and writing is mediocre but the first rate cast pulls it through to the final scene
What s not to like about this movie Every year you know that you re going to get one or two yule tide movies during Christmas time and most of them are going to be terrible This movie is definitely a fresh new idea that was pulled off pretty well A very funny take on a rich young guy paying a family to simulate a real Christmas for him What is the good of having money like that if you can t do fun things with it It was a win win situation A regular family gets six figures and a rich guy gets to experience Christmas like he imagined Only if br br Drew Latham Ben Affleck was incredibly difficult to deal with and it was just a riot to see the family reluctantly comply with his absurd demands It was a fun and funny movie
Its a good thing I rented the movie before seeing the viewer rating from this site It was a wonderful movie that I will be adding to my Christmas selection The cast was wonderfully chosen and Ben Affleck plays a good leading role I would tell viewers who have not seen the movie to go ahead and buy it I rate it right up there with Christmas vacation The movie was very funny and well written and Ben plays the eccentric rich executive very well The things he says and does is just how I would imagine a person with too much money to act The movie is much funnier than The Santa Claus and Christmas With The Kranks Plus it has a good story line and teaches the true meaning of Christmas which is you can t buy love with money
I had some reservations about this movie I figured it would be the usual bill of fare a formula movie about Christmas Being in the middle of a heat wave in late June we decided to give it a shot anyway maybe we would see some snow br br This movie turned out to be one laugh after another Ben Affleck was believable in his character but the real star of this one is James Gandofini He delivered his lines with a real wit about him and made a great dad br br If you want to have an enjoyable couple of hours definitely check this one out
Surviving Christmas is a surprisingly funny movie especially considering the bad publicity when it was first released Ben Affleck is funny as an obnoxious millionaire who pays the family that occupies his childhood home to be his family for Christmas He then drives the family crazy with overindulgence for Christmas cheer I have not been a Ben Affleck fan in the past though I did like Daredevil and Paycheck but here he is well cast in this role I also like Christina Applegate as the daughter in the family who can t stand Affleck s character at first Sure you can see where this movie is going but you don t care Ignore what the critics say and rent this movie out because it is funnier than a lot of Christmas movies
At first i didn t think that Ben Affleck could really pull off a funny Christmas movie boy was i wrong my daughter invited me to watch this with her and i was not disappointed at all James Gandolfini was funny i really liked Christina Appelagate and Catherine O Hara was good too the storyline is what really sold me i mean too put up with family at the table for people you only hardly see but once or twice a year and probably don t get along with anyway you really do need as much alcohol as you re system can stand to deal with Christmas so i thought that the premise was good there buying the family with 250000 dollars was a little on the far fetched side but it turned out to work pretty good for me cause it was a riot all the way through it shows the class struggle of the different families it has lot s of funny moments including embarrassing stuff on the computer for a teenage boy all in all i loved this movie and will watch it again next Christmas or sooner if my daughter wants too
What would you expect from a film titled Surviving Christmas and presented as festive fun something like Ghandi or English patient There are lots of things I love about this film it s funny it is very well cast and it is superbly written I came to the film as a Kaplan Elfort fan but was dubious when I read the plot it sounded ridiculous But the film doesn t come across like that because Affleck as Drew Latham plays his part perfectly one minute a child like adult the next a mature man who realises he has gained everything in life apart from what he really wants In fact we see Latham grow up in this film when he encounters the problems of those he envies and realises that their lives are not so good he sees that his own lot is not so bad br br This film has fewer weak or dud scenes than many other comedies I have seen Comedy is so much harder than any other type of drama it either works or it doesn t and very few comedy writers get it correct every time I particularly loved the drama scene where the family take to reading parts written by Latham The pleasure is in the reaction of Tom Valco James Gandolfini and the comments of Brian Valco Josh Zuckerman It is the dilemma of the greedy Tom Valco who has to bite his tongue wear silly hats or sing to the Christmas tree in order to earn the prize money that keeps the film moving along well br br The addition of daughter Alicia Christina Applegate into the story brings a delightful romantic angle and why not in a Christmas film Of course its corny and contrived he s rich and handsome she s beautiful and single and so inevitably her and Afflect end up falling over together in the snow and finding themselves face to face Great One thing I would have liked was more use of festive music to boost the atmosphere but I can t really complain I got what I wanted
This movie isn t as bad as I heard It was enjoyable funny and I love that is revolves around the holiday season It totally has me in the mood to Christmas shop and listen to holiday music When this movie comes out on DVD it will take the place of Christmas Vacation in my collection It will be a movie to watch every year after Thanksgiving to get me in the mood for the best time of the year I heard that Ben s character was a bit crazy but I think it just adds to the movie and why be so serious all the time Take it for what is it a Christmas comedy with a love twist I enjoyed it No it isn t Titanic and it won t make your heart pound with anticipation but it will bring on a laugh or two So go laugh and have a good time
I laughed so hard during this movie my face hurt Ben Affleck was hilarious and reminded me of a pretty boy Jack Black in this role Gandolfini gives his typical A performance The entire cast is funny the story pretty good and the comic moments awesome I went into this movie not expecting much so perhaps that is why I was so surprised to come out of the flick thoroughly pleased and facially exhausted I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys comedy can identify with loneliness during the holidays and or putting up with the relatives The best part to this film to me anyway were the subtle bits of humor that caught me completely off guard and had me laughing long after the rest of the audience had stopped Namely the scene involving the lighting of the Christmas tree Go see it and have a good laugh
This was a must see documentary for me when I missed the opportunity in 2004 so I was definitely going to watch the repeat I really sympathised with the main character of the film because this is true I have a milder condition of the skin problem he had Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa EB This is a sad sometimes amusing and very emotional documentary about a boy with a terrible skin disorder Jonny Kennedy speaks like a kid because of wasting vocal muscle and never went through puberty but he is 36 years old Most sympathising moments are seeing his terrible condition and pealing off his bandages Jonny had quite a naughty sense of humour he even narrated from beyond the grave when showing his body in a coffin He tells his story with the help of his mother Edna Kennedy his older brother and celebrity model and Jonny s supporter Nell McAndrew It won the BAFTAs for Best Editing and Best New Director Factual and it was nominated for Best Sound Factual and the Flaherty Documentary Award It was number 10 on The 100 Greatest TV Treats 2004 A must see documentary
This is probably the best documentary I have seen in a very long time Jonny Kennedy was and is still is a tragically beautiful inspiration Not only was he a survivor of one of the most painful diseases out there but he used his beauty to show the world that there is life after death and never to give up reaching people and spreading his love Watching minutes of his life long struggle was heart wrenching Listening to his smart ass remarks and seeing his adorable gestures was heartwarming And seeing him smile was indescribable I feel blessed to have been able to be touched by this tiny giant Please if you ever have a chance to watch this film consider yourself lucky to have met Jonny Kennedy
i was greatly moved when i watched the movie how jonny could keep such hope and faith was amazing so many people only care about what they want and fuss about all the things they don t have and they are such small things like chothes money a new car i ve seen people in tears because of a blemish this movie brings everything back to the basics love hope the beauty of the simple but so important things in life it makes our everyday problems seen for what they are Small and really unimportant you watch this boy and you realize as long as you have been blessed with food a roof over your head and your loved ones around you you are truly blessed and the saying stop and smell the roses truly has a new meaning and i know jonny will see this and i want to thank him so much for sharing such faith strenght and humor with me thank you jonny i know you soar the heavens and bring much love and laughter to the heavens above
This man is nothing short of amazing You truly feel as if you have lived his life with him throughout these tragic events and cry along with his family in the end He was so passionate about his cause not just for himself but to ensure others who will survive him do not have to go through this wretched pain I watch this video every time I am having a bad or down day and it always manages to make me see the great and brighter side of life just like Jonny did even with his unbearable pain My only regret is not knowing about Jonny sooner as I visited England 2 times during his life and would have been able to say I d met him It is comforting to know Jonny is sitting on his cloud pain free Rest in peace Dear Jonny You deserve it
The most moving and truly eye opening documentary ever created I cried the whole way through from start to end Watching the show you are immediately captured by a man s struggle to live without pain to live a life we would take for granted The first time I heard the title I was almost scared to see the program it was hard for me to comprehend living in agony every day of every year of my life I truly felt for him The saddest part of the documentary is when Jonny picks out his coffin Could you imagine doing that Even more so even though he was in excruciating and unbearable pain he still opened up his own charity DEBRA Jonny is one of the only people that deserves true respect and admiration he is the definition of a role model what a true and undeniable hero he was
In September 2003 36 year old Jonny Kennedy died He had a terrible genetic condition called Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa EB which meant that his skin literally fell off at the slightest touch leaving his body covered in agonising sores and leading to a final fight against skin cancer In his last months Jonny decided to work with filmmaker Patrick Collerton to document his life and death and the result was a film first broadcast in March that was an uplifting confounding and provocatively humorous story of a singular man Not shying away from the grim reality of EB the film was also a celebration of a life lived to the full Produced and directed by Patrick Collerton and first shown in March 2004 The Boy Whose Skin Fell Off has become the most talked about documentary of that year It attracted nearly five million viewers and after the screening the public donated over half a million pounds to Jonny s charity DEBRA A Jonny Kennedy Memorial Fund has been set up to raise another half a million with the aim of ensuring that Jonny Kennedy left a one million pound legacy
I have a two year old son who suffers from the same condition as Jonny Kennedy I never got the chance to meet him but I have never heard anybody say a bad word about him I hope he knows how much the making of this programme has helped his fellow sufferers by raising awareness of this terrible condition This man has touched people in a way that a million charity leaflets could not I believe that this should be compulsory viewing in schools I also agree with other comments what have I got to moan about He took everything that life could throw at him and still managed to retain a sense of humour God Bless I couldn t watch the part that showed his dressings being changed I have enough trouble with my son s
Was flipping around the TV and HBO was showing a double whammy of unbelievably horrendous medical conditions so I turned to my twin sister and said Hey this looks like fun truly I love documentaries so we started watching it At first I thought Jonni Kennedy was a young man but then it was explained that due to his condition he never went through puberty thus the high voice and smaller body He was on a crusade to raise money for his cause He had the most wonderful sense of humor combined with a beautiful sense of spirituality I cried watched some more laughed got up to get another Kleenex then cried some more Once Jonni Kennedy s time was up he flew to heaven to be with the angels He was more than ready he had learned his lessons from this life and he was free I highly recommend this If you do not fall in love with this guy you have no heart
I couldn t hold back the tears when I watched this beautiful documentary It was heart breaking disturbing and inspiring all in one I recommend this documentary to anyone seeking something that will make them think about what they are doing with their own lives Or simply something that will make you think You watch as John lives through the last couple months of his life You watch as he goes through his days with a positive attitude At one point you begin to see that he is truly an amazing individual You begin to understand that he has something to teach all of us His life and struggles will make you cry laugh and find that life s a lot easier to live if you just take it one day at a time
As with all of Angelopoulos films The Suspended Step of the Stork implicitly demands a close and intimate participation on the part of the viewer a fact that has certainly contributed to the limited popularity of his work Dialogues are sparing with no monologues or exchanges exteriorizing the characters inner conflicts doubts or feelings The filmmaker prefers to keep the viewers away from their own emotional responses and instead forces them to explore and study the characters identities for themselves As a result the acting is understated and implicit as opposed to overt and explicit br br The action scenes are set between long intervals of contemplation where the viewer is asked to become a participant to participate as an actor by probing his or her own psyche As in a novel where the drama rests entirely on the author s writing to provide a template where the reader s imagination and or past experience flourish Angelopoulos drama rests within his images his uses of the long shots the long takes the leisurely pacing the sparing dialogues that have become his trademark inviting the viewer to experience the film from his or her personal perspective Angelopoulos uses silence to capture moments of high intensity reverting to the non verbal language of gestures gazes sounds and music when he believes that words can only take us so far br br The music by Angelopoulos long time collaborator Eleni Karaindrou provides more than just a discreet background but becomes itself a dramatic element of the story A large part of the film consists of exterior shots in subtle subdued colors recorded in a drab winter light Angelopoulos presents us with an other Greece one far different from the Greece of the tourist brochures with ethereal blue skies and emerald seas drowned in an eternal sunshine Here the skies are covered and gray the air is cold and misty and the sands of the pristine beaches have been replaced by the trampled dirty snow of the village streets Angelopoulos genius through Arvanitis camera is on display throughout the film br br The Suspended Step of the Stork is above all else a political statement aimed at the socio political situation in the Balkans at the end of the twentieth century It is deeply concerned with the meaning of borders and with those who are the victims of the confusion between nations In the waiting room facing the Albanian border the refugees political or other outcast by the rest of humanity wait They may be stuck against a political border but unfortunately they still carry with them and hang on deeper ancestral borders those of the languages of the customs and of the races Although Angelopoulos political views are well known the film steers clear of any political discourse regarding the causes of the refugees plights In the process Angelopoulos forces us to meditate on the concepts of geographical cultural political and personal borders br br Angelopoulos considers himself a historian of twentieth century Greece and he likes to bring lessons from the Hellenic myths into his discussions In this film he does some border crossing himself between the Greek and Italian cultures drawing from a combined Homeric and Dantesque tradition of Odysseus travel Alexander is a Telemachus in search of a story about an aging Greek politician Odysseus who disappeared never to be heard of again This political man a brilliant orator unexpectedly and inexplicably left the comfort of his bourgeois existence his wife and his brilliant career to live anonymously in a refugee camp with the lowest of the low He became a poet in exile wondering how to change the world Of course the politician is not Alexander s father but the politician stands before Alexander like a father figure Odysseus As with Homer s Telemachus Alexander grows as a person during his odyssey br br Of course it would be wrong to try and see in the film a retelling of Homer s Odyssey in a contemporary context Angelopoulos draws on Odysseus s travels only as structuring and thematic elements for his film In Angelopoulos ending Odysseus is more like the Dante s Odysseus he does not leave for Ithaca but goes on carrying a suitcase And Alexander Telemachus is suspended between returning to his home and his career or embarking on a voyage to somewhere else He states as much in a voice over at the beginning of the film paraphrasing few lines from Dante s Inferno And don t forget that the time for a voyage has come again The wind blows your eyes far away br br Finally although Angelopoulos is not a religious person there is a Greek Orthodox religious theme introduced during the film in the form of the yellow suited linesmen who go around bettering things for their fellow human beings by reconnecting communications and also the Christ like figure of the politician In the final scene these men in yellow demonstrate once more the Byzantine iconography s influence in Angelopoulos work They appear like stylites religious figures found in the Orthodox tradition solitary and fervent men who took up their abode upon the tops of pillars in a form of asceticism br br The film ends without a resolution as to the true identity of the character played by Mastroianni Angelopoulos does not give us any clues and the wife s statement It s not him is far from convincing and left ambiguous enough The important question of the film is not whether he is or is not the vanished politician but that he could be the politician But the film still ends on an optimistic note Whereas the wires strung from pole to pole run only along the river and thus communications across the border are still not possible and it remains impenetrable we note that this final scene is taken from a point of view across the river the camera has crossed the border and the reverse tracking shot is inviting Alexander and the viewer to follow beyond the boundary On this account Angelopoulos gives us hope that somehow some of the borders will eventually crumble
A most recommendable masterpiece not only for the underlying themes of the story but also for the unmatchably brilliant and ingenious picture work of Angelopoulos not to mention the acting of giants Mastroianni and Moreau and the remarkable character play by Ilias Logothethis Gregory Karr s performance may seem overshadowed by his tough partners at first stance but in fact he perfectly plays his character which is revealed in his very last scene with the girl Khrysikou and the man Mastroianni albeit hinted beforehand Hence the spoiler br br Get your expectations straight It s an art movie in whatever meaning that phrase has to offer and requires attention Not for spending free time but for watching an artwork with the necessary concentration as in reading a book or attending a concert Due to the overall photographic style large screen viewing is recommended br br Dialogues are used sparingly But the film includes in addition to the standard Greek and English speaking fragments spoken in Albanian Kurdish and Turkish which will be attractive for those who are charmed by the beauty in hearing various languages
Enjoyed this 1936 film with plenty of veteran classic actors and especially William Powell Dr Lawrence Bradford Mister Roberts who played the role as a doctor and detective Dr Bradford was once married to Jean Arthur Paula Bradford Shane and got a divorce and still they managed to live with each other and also fight all the time Paula wanted her husband to investigate a homicide and did everything she could to convince him it was very important Jean Arthur plays a rather nutty type and there is plenty of 1936 Comedy and the method of murder is something you will never believe especially with a jockey on a California Race Track Robert Armstrong Nick Martel King Kong gave a great supporting role as a bookie along with James Gleason a detective who need the help of Dr Bradford in order to solve this very strange murder mystery If you see this film just remember it was produced and directed in 1936 and the people in the audience in those days thought this was great entertainment and it really was in Those DAYS
The Ex Mrs Bradford 1936 starring Thin Man series star William Powell this film was released the same year as the second Thin Man film After The Thin Man comes very close to duplicating the fun and style of the Thin Man films but it nonetheless misses Still it is a wonderfully fun highly entertaining murder mystery in the same comic vein br br Is Myrna Loy missed Of course let s not lie However I d be hard pressed to name a better substitute than Jean Arthur And the chemistry between Arthur and co star William Powell is real and it s fun romantic and involving br br The story and screenplay by Anthonyu Vieller and John Wyne s production company partner James Edward Grant The Angel The Bad Man is close to being up there with a Thin Man effort but lacks a bit of the proper wit and sizzle br br While it s not in the stratosphere of The Thin Man movies what else is The Ex Mrs Bradford is one of the most entertaining of the dozens and dozens of mystery comedy who done its of the 30s 40s
William Powell is a doctor dealing with a murder and an ex wife in The Ex Mrs Bradford also starring Jean Arthur Eric Blore and James Gleason It seems that Powell had chemistry going with just about any woman with whom he was teamed Though he and Myrna Loy were the perfect screen couple the actor made a couple of other Thin Man type movies one with Ginger Rogers and this one with Arthur both to very good effect br br Somehow one never gets tired of seeing Powell as a witty debonair professional and The Ex Mrs Bradford is no exception The ex Mrs B has Mr B served with a subpoena for back alimony and then moves back in to help him solve a mystery that she s dragged him into And this isn t the first time she s done that It almost seems as though there was a Bradford film before this one or that this was intended to be the first of a series of films Mr B complains that his mystery writer ex is constantly bringing him into cases This time a jockey riding the favorite horse in a raise mysteriously falls off the horse and dies right before the finish line br br The solution of the case is kind of outlandish but it s beside the point The point is the banter between the couple and the interference of the ex Mrs B Jean Arthur is quite glamorous in her role and very funny However with an actress who comes off as brainy as Arthur does the humor seems intentional rather than featherbrained I suspect the writer had something else in mind say the wacky side of Carole Lombard When Arthur hears that the police have arrived she says Ah it s probably about my alimony I ve been waiting for the police to take a hand in it it s more of a rib to Powell rather than a serious statement It still works well and it shows how a good actress can make a part her own br br Definitely worth watching as William Powell and Jean Arthur always were
I ve seen the Thin Man series Powell and Loy are definitely great but there is something awfully sweet about Powell and Arthur s chemistry in this flick Jean Arthur SHINES when she looks at Powell There is an unmistakable undercurrent buzzing between them This film may not have the wit of the Thin Man series but undeniably makes up for it in charm While I watched it I thought for sure Powell was carrying on an off screen affair with Arthur My friends thought the same This is one film where I wish I could step back in time to schmooze and lock lips with Powell There seems to be no end to his lovable playful smirks Powell s character Lawrence Bradford is probably the closest thing to the perfect man Okay this is sounding way too gushy but I can t help myself
RKO studios decided to borrow both William Powell from MGM and Jean Arthur from Columbia for one of their more big budget efforts to cash in on the popularity of The Thin Man They succeeded to some degree br br A lot of folks forget that in addition to and earlier than Nick Charles Bill Powell also played in a few Philo Vance films in the title role So by this time he was pretty well set in the role Doctor Bradford is not doing as many liquid lunches as Nick Charles but the basic blas√© Nick is still there One difference is that while Nick Charles married an heiress Doctor Bradford works for a living as a physician That helps in his avocation of detective and in fact it does in this film br br He s got two murders to solve A jockey falls off a horse coming into the homestretch of a big race and dies for no apparent reason The trainer suspects something afoot but he s bumped off by the more conventional method of a bullet This is after he comes to Bill Powell for help br br Myrna Loy was a more steadying influence on Bill Powell than Jean Arthur was Arthur plays it as more of a dizzy dame than Loy did But it works here and she and Powell have good chemistry br br The ever dependable James Gleason is the police inspector in the Sam Levene Nat Pendleton role All they needed here was Asta and possibly Eric Blore as Powell s butler was essaying that part br br If Powell and Arthur were signed at this studio we might have seen a whole slew of Bradford films
The comic banter between William Powell and Jean Arthur is the highlight of this murder mystery which has one of the most bizarre and unlikely plots ever Powell is probably the most suave detective of the 30 s and Arthur has a unique voice which often sounds like a succession of tiny tinkly bells They are extremely fun to watch so take the brashness of the plot with a grain of salt and just enjoy seeing it unfold Eric Blore also has some comic turns as Powell s butler br br Powell s contract with MGM included a clause which allowed him to reject being loaned out to another studio but he wanted to work again with Arthur and he liked the script so he eagerly accepted the assignment They had worked together in two 1929 Paramount films The Canary Murder Case and The Greene Murder Case both in the Philo Vance series
I have just managed to get hold of the Celestial region 3 DVD of The Five Venoms and what a super job they have made of it A fantastic digitally remastered transfer and a must have for any Kung Fu fan br br The story is pretty straight forward and has been mentioned already so I won t go into it again Needless to say it s the fight scenes that many buy the movie for and they do not disappoint Only problem is they are a bit few and far between and seem over rehearsed Bruce Lee could take these lot on and drink a cup of tea at the same time All kicks and punches come with the all important type writer clicks and air whooshes which is a cool effect though quite amusing br br I give this movie a B Good but not great In a way I feel it could have been that bit better Golden Swallow by the same director a decade earlier had as good a story and better action
The Five Deadly Venoms is easily the most memorable K F flick from the Shaw Brothers stable exc maybe Master Killer It has the artists who came to be known as simply The Venoms some of the best fight choreography ever and surprisingly for a Kung Fu movie a great plot One of my all time favorites
Five Deadly Venoms is not as bloody and violent as Story Of Ricky or Super Ninjas but it features some of the best hand to hand fight sequences in Hong Kong film history Director Chang Cheh creates what is considered by many to be his masterpiece This movie launched the careers of the five men who play the venoms Meng Lo plays yet another bad ass He would go on to be in Super Ninjas Kuo Chui who is Philip Kwok would go on to Story Of Ricky and Hard Boiled Any chop socky fan can apperciate this But I still think it ain t as good as Super Ninjas also made by Chang Cheh But all chop socky is good and this is one of the very best
I recall seeing this movie as a kid I don t recall where I saw it I must have been around 14 years old I thought the movie was incredible and wished to see it again It came on the Kung Fu channel once but I missed it I was really bummed It is the best special effects Kung Fu movie that I ve seen to date I highly recommend it and now that I ve discovered where to get it I can enjoy it once more and for years to come I also have to check out this Return of the Venom movie of which some have spoken so highly
After reading tons of good reviews about this movie I decided to take it for a spin I bought it on DVD hence the spin pun I m a dork The beginning was everything I hoped for a perfect set up along with some quotes that I ve heard on Various Wu Tang albums to what should have been a good movie But the plot I heard was so great was so predictable Every time I saw a character except for the Lizard I guessed which Venom he was Plus the only cool character gets killed off in the middle of the movie Ok so the plot wasn t very good but at least there was some good kung fu right Wrong The fights were very short and few and far between Granted the different styles were all pretty cool but I wish the fights were longer I kept hoping to see the Lizard run and do some crazy ish on the walls but it never happened I was hoping to see the Centipede do some tight speedy ish but it never happened I was hoping to see the Scorpion in the movie for more than 7 total minutes but it never happened In short not much happens The fighting is all pretty routine Don t be fooled just becuase this movie has a plot it does not mean it s a good one
When I was very young on a local tv station they would show kung fu movies of all kinds on Saturdays I saw lots of Kung Fu movies on weekends I remember lots of them I saw great flicks like Crippled Masters Blind Fist of Bruce Kung Fu Zombie Shaolin Drunken Monk Rage of the Master Tattoe Dragon and Five Deadly Venoms I remember the day clearly Me and my dad had just gotten lunch at Burger King We were racing home to see what movie it would be this saturday We ran in the house and jumped onto the couch turned on the set and flicked it onto 56 The usual intro of many kung fu movie clips in the background with the words Kung Fu Saturday over it Then under that was the Title of the film It said Five Deadly Venoms Then the movie began I bit into my burger amused with the pre credit sequence I loved this movie the minute it came on My favorite character was the Toad Venom The plot was hard to follow at that age but that wasn t what lured me it was the fighting The fights were so amazing I moaned every time a commercial came on and soon the 2 hours of the best movie i have ever seen ended
This movie is really good The plot which works like puzzle forces viewer to think and guess what will happen next Such a trick brings a lot of surprises and makes a viewer really looking forward to solution of a riddle Fighting scenes are very good There s a lot of different combat styles although one of styles was a bit unreal for me but it s only my opinion to watch and it s fascinating show The only thing which may be irritating is actors look A bit too effeminate at least for me Hong Kong was always good at kung fu movies especially in the 70 s and 80 s so Five Venoms or other its versions is great choice
I saw this kung fu movie when I was a kid and I thought it was so cool Now I am 26 years old and my friend has it on DVD br br We got a case of brew and watched this classic It lost NONE of it s original kung fu coolness If you are a fan of kung fu karate movies this is a must see the DVD is available I believe this movie is also called Pick Your Poison br br Watch it soon
I really like this movie I can watch it on a regular basis and not tire of it I suppose that is one of my criteria for a great movie br br The story is very interesting It introduces us to 6 characters each has a unique kung fu style that is very secret and very deadly Each of these characters are trained by the same master but their identities are kept secret from each other The dying master sends the 6th venom his last student to attempt to make right the wrongs that he suspects some of his students have committed br br How will the last pupil find the other venoms How will he know which of them is bad The way these questions are answered is part of what makes this movie great br br We also get to see the venoms fight each other in every combination It is fun to see how their styles match up against each other br br If you want to see if you like kung fu movies this is a good movie to start with It doesn t get any better than this
If you love kung fu films and you haven t seen this movie you are cheating yourself This movie is one of the only kung fu cheapies that could be recommended for fans of all types of film Normally it takes a die hard fan of the genre to see anything in these films but this one has it all The story is well told and complete The fight scenes are great and tend to end before you re completely bored with them unlike Crouching Tiger Throw in a little mystery and torture and you ve got yourself one heck of a movie See this one at all costs Heck my wife even enjoyed it br br Wu Du it br br 9 out of 10 br br
This is one of my favourite kung fu films and is regarded as one the most popular Shaw Brothers from the late 70 s The plot is interesting and twisty the characters are cool each with their own style toad snake lizard etc The action is limited in comparison with other Chang Cheh Venoms films but what is there is interesting with different kung fu styles on display from the various characters I recommend this film to those who think all Shaw Brothers especially Chang Cheh s films are the same most of his films usually focus on the 10 tigers and Shaolin vs Manchu conflicts This film is breath of fresh air in comparison
A dying Kung Fu master sends out his last student in order to track down what happened to the previous five students who were members of the banned Poison Clan He is to see if they are acting for good and if not he his to stop them The master also wants the student to find another member of the clan who ran off with the clans money which the master wants used for good The earlier students were all taught in a different style snake centipede scorpion lizard toad while the last student was taught a little in each style All of the students end up in one town looking for the old man with all of the money and soon everyone is battling to get the money br br Classic martial arts film has title that even many non fans know I ve spoken with a couple of casual fans and this seems to be the one film that sticks in their head Its a very good movie though I m not really sure why this film stays with people when for my money there are other films that are better from the Shaw studio One armed Swordmen or the Brave Archer series for example This isn t to sell the film short its not since the film is structured like a mystery our hero has no clue who anyone is and the Venoms themselves only know at best who two of the others is We re given the identity of four but we still have to work out who the fifth really is The film is also odd in that for a martial arts film other than a training sequence at the start and the killing of the old man and his family for the money there is really no action for about 40 or 45 minutes Its a bold move to do it but it pays off since the plot and the performances hold your attention The film is also odd in that its the first martial arts film I think I ve ever seen where there are no women I don t think one has a speaking role and I m pretty sure that none appear in the background Its indicative of nothing its just something that struck me This is a good solid little film that may not live up to the reputation it has in some circles but is still a really good film to curl up with on your couch br br Around 7 out of 10
One of the more enjoyable aspects of Asian cinema or indeed most anything done outside these holier than thou United States are the permutations that crop up In post World War Two Japanese manga comics for instance are to be found a veritable endless variety of subjects many of them handled in uniquely imaginative fashion The same thing happens in genre film making as well though again I m referring to movies made outside the U where we re just too sophisticated in our close mindedness to appreciate anything that isn t about or by US Would an American company for instance back not one but a series of movies featuring a masked professional wrestler El Santo or a werewolf Paul Naschy or a real life martial artist Bruce Lee As for television forget it While I still love the KUNG FU series that starred the late David Carradine I ve always felt that the Americanized version of Asian martial arts was how to put it kindly a bit lacking To this very day there hasn t been a pay per view channel to feature Asian martial artists playing Asian martial artists in Asia There are lots of soft core porn masquerading as entertainment shows but the so called Action Channel for instance has yet to import or to produce a True Martial Arts teleseries Before Brother Cadfile was investigating murders on the BBC there was of all things at least one Kung Fu movie that featured a group of martial artists more or less involved in a murder mystery THE 5 DEADLY VENOMS In its own right as fascinating as any other genre based whodunit western cop show etc this martial arts masterpiece stands out as a truly superior piece of work It s now available from Dragon Dynasty and the print is beautiful and the DVD commentary by Bey Logan is EXACTLY the kind of intelligent thoughtful analysis these gems truly deserve If you re a martial arts movie fan rejoice one of the greatest movie genres of all time specifically the martial arts movies of the 1970s and early 1980s are getting a long overdue second life and greatly appreciated second look on DVD
In the world of old school kung fu movies where revenge pictures came a dime a dozen it took a lot for a film to stand out and even more to make it a fan favorite after all these years What is arguably Chang Cheh s finest movie continues to hold influence over the Hong Kong movie industry from the themes of loyalty brotherhood and revenge as explored by John Woo who got his start in the HK movie industry working for Chang during the heyday of heroic bloodshed during the late 1980 s to more modern movies like A Man Called Hero which sports a character in a costume inspired by this film The influence has also carried into other areas as well from music such as the Wu Tang Clan TV commercials for Sprite and video games such as Mortal Kombat So what makes this movie so special The plot on the surface is pretty simple It deals with members of a rogue group known as the Poison Clan who are searching for a treasure hidden by their sifu All of the members of the clan have extraordinary kung fu abilities denoted by their animal styles or venoms the lizard can climb walls the scorpion has a deadly strike etc The twist is that since the clan always wears masks not all of them known who the others are Thus a simple plot becomes almost a suspense thriller We re not talking The Usual Suspects here but it s far above many other kung fu movies of the time Supposedly Golden Harvest was not too happy with Chang s script like most of his movies they felt it was too dark and violent and they actually wanted him to add broad comic relief to it Thankfully Chang stuck to his guns and stayed with his original script which has since has become revered as one of the best for the films of its time if not ever completing an almost perfect dramatic arc and providing the perfect backbone for the extraordinary action sequences br br But what really solidifies the movie are the venoms themselves Chang Cheh hit upon a magical formula with the cast not only did he gain talented martial artists whose moves competed without the aid of wires or other special effects put most modern martial artists to shame but great actors as well The formula proved so popular that Chang usually had one or more of the venoms in his later movies Getting back to matters at hand in most old school movies the actors seem to playing out cardboard cutouts but here the actors actually create characters It seems that everyone has a favorite venom mine is Philip Kwok best known to many as Mad Dog from Hard Boiled as Lizard and it is this personal connection to the characters that The Five Deadly Venoms generates which makes it a true classic of the genre Even if you re normally not a fan of old school movies you need to check The Five Deadly Venoms out if for nothing else to see where modern movies got their inspiration from
There s no romance or other side plot to this movie it s action and intrigue all the way making it a real man s kung fu movie br br An aging master dispatches his last disciple Yan Tieh to stop his five former pupils who s styles represents five venomous animals centipede snake scorpion lizard and the toad Despite the word Venom in the title none of these pupil uses venoms to kill their opponents Yan Tieh told by his teacher that he s no match for the five former pupil must find one he can form an alliance with to defeat the other four How Yan Tieh and the others find each other is the intrigue to the story with good kung fu action spread out throughout the story br br Recognized as a cult classic this movie has already established itself in the annals of kung fu action movies It s known well enough that other movies make reference to the five styles depicted in this story br br It s no artistic masterpiece with the usual bad dubbing and corny acting but the movie is one of the best of its kind because its so focused on the all the ingredients of kung fu action movie of its time and gives an extra concentrated dose of them br br One movie you must watch if you are a kung fu movie fan
Of all the kung fu films made through the 70 s and 80 s this is one that has developed a real cult following With the exception of all the films Bruce Lee starred in this is a film that has stood the test of time and its due to the unique story An aging kung fu master tells his last pupil Yang Tieh Sheng Chiang about five pupils he has trained in the past All five wore masks and nobody has seen the face of each other and they have all been trained differently Their specialty in kung fu is the name they have adopted like Lizard Snake Centipede Toad and Scorpion The master called them the Poison Clan and he does not know what has happened to them so he wants Tieh to find them and help the ones that are doing good to stop the others that are evil An old man who was once a member of the Poison Clan has a map to where he has hidden a lot of money and he seems to be a target Tieh does not know what they look like so he has to mingle in society and try and figure out who they are Tieh has discovered that the Snake is Hung Wen Tung Pai Wei and along with Tang Sen Kue Feng Lu who is the Centipede they kill a family to find the map A map is found by a mystery man who turns out to be the Scorpion but know one knows who he is A local policeman named Ho Yung Sin Philip Kwok investigates the murders along with his partner Ma Chow Chien Sun Sin has a friend called Li Ho Meng Lo who is the Toad and they do know of each others identity The Snake bribes the local officials to pin the murders on Li Ho and while he is in prison he is tortured and killed When Sin finds out he teams up with Tieh and together they go to combat Tung and Kue br br This film was directed by Cheh Chang and he was a very special director when it came to these films Chang was not your run of the mill kung fu director and his films always had a special quality to them While most martial arts films deal with revenge Chang did not use that as a central theme Even though there is some revenge going on later in this story this film is more complex than that Five men trained by the same master in different ways and wearing masks Then they are all in the same area and not knowing who the other is Very unique story makes this film different from all the others and most of Changs stories were in a class all by themselves I wouldn t exactly put it in the same league as Enter The Dragon because Bruce Lee was a worldwide icon and the martial arts he exhibited were more authentic looking This film still has some impossible feats like clinging to sides of walls and all the flipping through the air but this film isn t necessarily about fight scenes Its more about the intrigue of the story and the characters that are involved That alone makes this different from all the other kung fu films Very well made with a unique story
Be careful with this one Once you get yer mitts on it it ll change the way you look at kung fu flicks You will be yearning a plot from all of the kung fu films now you will be wanting character depth and development you will be craving mystery and unpredictability you will demand dynamic camera work and incredible backdrops Sadly you won t find all of these aspects together in one kung fu movie EXCEPT for Five Deadly Venoms br br Easily the best kung fu movie of all time Venoms blends a rich plot full of twists and turns with colourful and developed characters along with some of the best camerawork to come out of the 70s The success of someone liking the film depends on the viewers ability to decipher which character is which and who specializes in what venom One is the Centipede two is the Snake three is the Scorpion four is the Lizard and five is the Toad Each character has different traits characteristics strengths and weaknesses Therein lies the hook we learn along with the student character finding out who these different men turn out to be We are in his shoes so to speak and we have to pick who we trust and who we don t just like he does We learn along with him br br Not only is the plot the characters and the camerawork great it s also fun to watch which in my book makes it more valuable than almost any other movie of it s kind It s worth quite a few watches to pick up on everything that s going on Venoms is a lesson on what kung fu can really do just don t expect many other kung fu films to live up to it s gauntlet
After reviewing this intense martial arts movie for the first time in nearly 18 years I must say it did not lose any of its mysticism nor any of its eye popping martial arts action as I had remembered from my youth The story of a dying martial arts instructor sending his unfinished pupil out to find the 5 past members of his Poison Clan so they do not seek out a fortune which the master s friend keeps hidden Afraid that his last pupil did not have enough training he instructs him to befriend one of the five venoms so as to defeat the other four br br I can t say enough about the choreography or the camera work A fine film in its own right and quite possible one of the best martial arts movies ever made A CLASSIC
Well I must say that this was one hell of a fun movie Despite the fact that the dubbing was pretty cheesy and there were some odd moments where the film seemed to turn dark blue for no apparent reason I was not disappointed The story was actually pretty interesting the last member of the Poison Clan must track down the other five members and discover who among them is using their skills for evil and who is using them for good The catch being that during training all of the clan were masked and all have since returned to society in disguise and changed their names br br The fights are a joy to watch as each member of the Poison Clan has a different fighting style toad my favorite snake scorpion lizard and centipede The fight scenes have the actors jumping all over the place and thankfully the camera stays planted and uses a wide enough shot so you can clearly see all of the action br br The one drawback to the movie is that the story tends to drag a bit in the first half up until the first fight sequence But stick with it and you won t be disappointed
Most 70s and 80s Kong Kong martial arts films barely function as movies usually there are a few well planned fight sequences but the plot is scraped pretty thin to fill in the gaps between those nodes like porno films really br br But this one does several things well Most overtly there is the direction and choreography which confines each combatant to a style it s really based on Chinese circus acrobatics and comedic theater but the effect works br br Second there is the language of the camera which uses some impressive techniques even by today s measure changing projection speeds from real time time to slow motion and from unfiltered to filtered views to depict story direction toward the past or toward the future br br Least overt but most powerful and unexpected is the construction The winner of this contest is determined by who unfolds the story The master the writer sets up a game where the lead character doesn t know who he s seeking which is the same situation we viewers find ourselves in One by one he figures out who is who at the same rate we find out who is who It all follows a tragedy noir arc The ending tends toward irony a la The Sting Much more clever stuff than what we usually get out of this genre br br The five venoms idea is the template for Tarantino s deadly viper assassins from the Kill Bill volumes
For all the hoopla respect and recognition this film gets from Kung Fu historians it still lacks glaringly in a couple critical areas action and fight scenes But I must say that the plot is probably the best and most original I ve ever seen in a martial arts film Five Deadly Venoms without a doubt is a must see not only that a movie you can watch again and again but I also must say that after watching it you feel it could have been even better It somehow leaves you wanting something you want more The producer Chang Cheh sets up the storyline beautifully for a potential masterpeice but doesn t follow through with giving us more of the action we want The fighting styles in the movie really captures the viewer Centipede Snake Scorpion Lizard Toad and they are shown but battles are noticeably short The Toad and Snake styles are particularly intriguing and should have been showcased much much more in fact the Toad is killed off by the middle of the movie Interestingly enough with this movie the absence of constant action or fighting leads to development of a great plot this is one of the few kung fu films where you are really interested in the storyline and care about the outcome This movie has a dark and vicious tone to it and you are drawn into the vibe Sinister weapons and torture tactics are used throughout the movie and adds to the movies feel To start off the movie and to introduce the Poison Clan producer Chang Cheh takes us to a grimy dungeon The ending fight scenes are certainly good but seem muffled and somehow you expected more Still though this movie is one of Shaw Brothers best and is quite enjoyable My overall impression of the movie would conclude with this The styles the fighters used are merely shown to us and not showcased in detail sad thing is the director had the goods for something extraordinary right at his fingertips and didn t expand on it I am left wondering what could have been with this movie still one of the best though 8 out of 10 on the scale
Seldom do I ever encounter a film so completely fulfilling that I must speak about it immediately This movie is definitely some of the finest entertainment available and it is highly authentic I happened to see the dubbed version but I m on my way right now to grab the DVD remaster with original Chinese dialogue Still the dubbing didn t get in the way and sometimes provided some seriously funny humour Poison Clan rocks the world br br The story telling stays true to Chinese methods of intrigue suspense and inter personal relationships You can expect twists and turns as the identities of the 5 venoms are revealed and an expert pace br br The martial arts fight choreography is in a class of its own and must be seen to be believed It s like watching real animals fight each other but construed from their own arcane martial arts forms Such level of skill amongst the cast is unsurpassed in modern day cinema br br The combination provides for a serious dose of old Chinese culture and I recommend it solely on the basis of the film s genuine intent to tell a martial arts story and the mastery of its execution Of course if you just want to see people pummel each other along with crude forms of ancient Chinese torture be my guest
The Five Deadly Venoms is a great kung fu action movie wrapped in a whodunnit mystery There are all the usual telltale signs of a kung fu flick great choreography awful dubbing different styles of fighting and a wide range of greatly exaggerated often cheesey human emotions However the plot certainly is better than average It s interesting and holds your attention throughout the non fight scenes Occasionally it s even able to fire up the audience such as when X character receives horrible injustice br br Another thing I love about the Five Deadly Venoms is the beautiful simplicity of the movie s morals and themes Just about everyone gets what s coming to them The cowardly greedy and corrupt lose out The bad guys consumed by selfish greed are ultimately destroyed by their own treachery and backstabbing The good guys use teamwork planning and integrity to overcome the odds and come out on top br br Poison Clan rocks
This is definitely one of the best kung fu movies ever and may be one of the best movies ever It s got a great plot that functions like a puzzle with lots of intrigue and suspense This film is full of cat and mouse games and deceptions with people hiding their identities and their natures The characters in this film live and breath much more than your average kung fu movie characters They are all interesting and compelling and the movie does a good job at giving them scenes to show their personality s and desires br br The fight scenes play out like little stories and many of them are very original and exciting It has cool training sequences and martial arts skills that are so awesome they enter the realm of fantasy There are 5 members of the poison clan each one with his own style that mimics the special skill of a venomous animal The styles of each of these characters are fun to watch and you can see the techniques they use in training applied during the film When this happens The director uses quick cutting back to the training scene to draw a parallel These cuts are accompanied by music changes and sound effects and the whole thing really works nicely br br One thing about this movie that is very original is the way it treats death The director Chang Cheh was obviously very concerned that the film not trivialize death This makes some of the scenes in the movie much more effective We actually care when people are killed in this film This is because the camera lingers on the horror of death even when the bad guys are killed Some of the sequences in this movie are truly gut wrenching When characters go in search of vengeance you really feel their anger and pain br br At the same time this is also a fun movie It has all the typical things you expect from a traditional kung fu film There is bad dubbing The characters are willing to fight at the drop of a hat Some of the sound effects are hilarious and at times the behavior of the characters is incredibly unrealistic all this just adds to the greatness of the film br br And lets not forget that this director was a visual stylist much more gifted than most of his contemporaries If you watch this movie closely you will notice that the technical prowess on display is virtuostic Everything goes by so fast because of the quick cutting style and the rapid camera movements of the genre that it is easy to overlook how beautiful the movie really is The lighting and composition are spectacular at times The camera work and movement is extremely sophisticated along with very interesting fast paced editing In the scenes that portray suspense and intrigue for example imagine Hitchcock moving at about twice the speed Chang Cheh was truly a master craftsman and artist who knew his genre and was able to produce important material while working within it s confines He doesn t rattle the boat of the kung fu genre film but in a subtle way his skills permeate every scene and every shot and they add greatly to the quality of the work He is an important filmmaker who continues to influence many people br br This is the real package A kung fu movie that delivers on every level It s art it s trash it s emotionally moving and it s fun it has a true sense of morality but doesn t allow that morality to get in the way of delivering good action I recommend it to everybody whether you are a fan of this genre or not
The thought of Sarah Silverman having her own show worried me at first The films she has appeared in were not very funny and her humor is a bit off However I was very surprised to see her true colors shine in this Comedy Central gem I could possibly put her on par with the likes of Amy Sedaris in Strangers with Candy Sarah s character is a true sociopath very comparable to Sedaris Jerri Blank br br The one downfall of this show is its supporting cast Her sister s character is good Funny at times but ultimately meant not to steal Sarah s show However the rest of the cast is extremely sub par in comparison br br I m glad though that Comedy Central has given Sarah a chance to show her unique and crazy sense of self and humor
I would give this show a ten out of ten if it was not for the fart jokes You people are so damn sensitive it is inane So quick to point out the racism of the show and the jokes yet are also so quick to say ridiculously sexist pig headed crap like well duh some of these other shows do these jokes so much better because at least they have hot women So disgusting Abortion jokes are great because really who takes abortion seriously anyways At least I m not a bore son I hear that Reba McEntire and Sarah Silverman are teaming up to do a movie about sisters taking a road trip together Talk about a movie of the year
I have to vote this 10 out of 10 in the rare chance that she happens to see this review takes pity on me whisks me to Hollywood and involves me in her freaky funny world But in all seriousness it was good First episode is obviously finding it s feet but it s got that Silverman weirdness running all the way through it It s not a laugh out loud sort of comedy but that s good thing too much has a laughter track to it and this wouldn t be right with cues when to laugh it s to the audience to hear their inner jester laughing at the absurdness of it all I can easily see this as being the bizarro Drew Carey show with it s weird characters and incredibly strong central character Well worth a watch look forward to the following episodes A VERY good chance from the usual comedy out there br br ps Sarah Call me
The Sarah Silverman program is better than those other shows No laugh tracks no painful jokes just a program The Sarah Silverman program If you re like me and you love comedy this is probably a show for you br br Sarah Silverman brings out there funny and right here funny to the table with ease A mix of different styles which makes for its own br br This program isn t something you want to start a compare war with seeing as how it has absolutely nothing to do with them other shows This show is its own entity and i think most comedy heads will like it just fine br br Go watch and see
Best show since Seinfeld She s really really funny Her total self centeredness the hulking gay stoner neighbors the departures into song or cartoons make this the freshest show on TV One of the few shows I make point of watching The scene with the wise old black lady in the drugstore oh wait now that you re close you do look old turns face with finger and walks away lol the cough syrup overdose sleeping with God it s all so funny or so stupid it s just a lot of fun The shows weak points are her sister and the cop only because they re too darn normal I really can t wait until the next show something I haven t felt for any show in a long time
Don t listen to the prissy critics who are probably bitter gamers still sore from the roasting Silverman infamously gave them at Spike TV Video Game Awards a couple of months ago The Sarah Silverman is wonderfully bizarre surreal immature ridiculous and would fit rather nicely in a Adult Swim line up If Silverman tones down the juvenile doody jokes and emphasizes the darker meaner undercurrent the show is so far just hinting at we could have one of the greatest cult comedies since the cancelled Strangers With Candy But just from watching the pilot its just solid not outstanding offbeat dark comedy musical but with huge potential br br Silverman has created a hilarious child woman of a character a prettier younger Jewish American Princess version of the late great Jerri Blank and the show features one of the most unconventional non stereotypical portrayals of a gay couple I have ever seen on television Early reviews are suggesting the next couple of episodes surpass the pilot so I can t wait to see how this show unfolds
The Sarah Silverman program is very similar to Sarah s own stand up It s so over the top with prejudice that you can t possibly take it to heart The fact is though that while most all people will get it it doesn t mean they will all appreciate it It s a very polarizing and one dimensional show so if you don t like it after 10 minutes you may as well give up there If you do like it after 10 minutes stay tuned because every episode thus far has been as good as the last br br Like all shows though it is not perfect Personally I love the program but there are some huge faults with it Racist songs are funny but get older a lot faster than Silverman seems to realize a problem that I had with Jesus is Magic as well It seems as if Silverman gave herself a quota for songs per episode that doesn t need to exist Not to mention that while the lyrics to the songs she writes are good the music well isn t br br Another thing to keep in mind is that while this show will for some reason appeal to fans of Monty Python Upright Citizens Brigade etc it is nothing like those shows I can watch Monty Python all day but as much as I like this show I can t watch more than the half hour limit at a time It gets flat very fast The repeat value for this show is low too the second time around an episode is fairly funny and by the third time in my opinion it s boring br br Still that first time around is very very funny Give it a shot
Following a sitcom plot is so mindlessly easy that having her character simultaneously operate both within and without the context the rest of the cast inhabit is the kind of experimentalism that sitcoms could really use The supporting characters ground the show in a sitcom reality which provides a contextual counterpoint to Sarah s erratic persona which beyond general insensitivity has no specific recurring traits for behavioural expectations to be based on making her less a character than a canvas to be repainted in every episode if not scene Sarah s ability to see everything from an outside perspective enables her to parody aspects of social behaviour that are subtle enough to usually go unnoticed Every time she speaks it s like a self contained 5 second skit She overemotes a lot demonstrating the countless things a smile or change in vocal pitch can signify but never sticks with one idea long enough for you to get comfortable and form expectations that will be satisfied This may be the most creative original and experimental TV program ever
First and foremost I would like to say that I m a huge Sarah Silverman fan and having other people say that and then rag on the pilot is beyond me Everything in the pilot was in typical Sarah Silverman form maybe not directly funny but the situation and the delivery are what counts br br If you liked Jesus is Magic then I don t see how you wouldn t like this It has that same flow and that same rhythm True it s only for the true fans but if you are you ll be pleased br br Again only for the true fans there s no way around that If you re not used to her style then you wouldn t get why this is funny However it is and I hope you think so too
When I first saw this show I thought it looked interesting I watched it saw how it revolved around Sarah like the character sees the world revolving around her I got it but wasn t laughing very much br br Onstage and in her show she s racist crude insensitive and hugely self centered I didn t get her at first and took it all at face value Then I got to see her movie Jesus is Magic I think that served as a Sarah Silverman primer for me explaining to me just what language she s speaking She s like Marilyn Manson working so hard to give us a faceful of horrible ideas and images but you eventually realise it isn t an assault it s a statement And once you understand that you find you re glad someone s finally giving it to you straight br br I don t mean to suggest only smart people will understand or that to hate this show is to prove your idiocy While I like a lot of smart shows I still to this day do not see the humor of Curb Your Enthusiasm I get the impression that it s good but I just don t get it Many people will never get the Sarah Silverman Program but I m glad I eventually came around br br The creators of this show do work hard every episode is loaded not just with dialogue and plot but with songs or dream sequences production numbers These people aren t putting together something to fill a time slot and please advertisers they appear to be on a mission to make the best show they can put together If I was to predict the future of this show I d say it will go the way of Arrested Development and Freaks Geeks It will get canceled before it s time and live on in fans hearts and on DVD But take heart SSP creators your audience IS out there and we ll be watching for as long as they let you make the show
Big S isn t playing with taboos or forcing an agenda like say Mencia or Chapelle though I like them both She states the obvious in subtle near subliminal remarks Her show won t change the World nor is it meant to But along with the hilarious Brian Posehn and Paget Brewster s ex boyfriend Jay Johnston of Mr Show fame this is one mean show with an appetite for destruction My side s were thoroughly wrecked by the first episode Look I love this woman and like her famed boyfriend Jimmy Kimmel she just delivers the lines and lets the viewer run with it The best kind of comedy around Spoofing anything and anyone like Mary Poppins in the second episode when she sings to the fake birds on to quick hitting commentary on society and college aged existential nonsense This one is highly recommended but only for those who still have a funny bone and didn t lose it in their most recent lippo suction treatment or boob job
Sarah Silverman is a dangerous Bitch She s beautiful sexy funny and talent dark and demonic I read the other comment on this show as well as the message board stuff and people just don t get it Nothing that appears on T V is an accident Too much money time and work is put into the production of a T V show for there to be mistakes This show is stupid because Sarah wanted it to be stupid This show is juvenile because Sarah wanted it to be juvenile I thought the jokes were great and the theme show as well as the other musical numbers are wonderfully bizarre It s a lot like Pee Wee s Playhouse for maladjusted slacker twenty something glue sniffing Future Pornstars of America from the Valley The cast is awesome The scenarios and action is well paced I hope this show succeeds since Comedy Central didn t let David spade keep his show Who plays Sarah s sister She not in the cast listing on the show s home page I would love to see her stand up Does anyone know about her up coming show dates or DVDs that may be floating around out there
I think this show is screamingly funny It s not for every taste and I m not going to elevate or denigrate the folks that don t get it I m sure they re wonderful bright people that operate at a different wavelength But if you like it you REALLY like it Sarah plays a self infatuated loser named Sarah Silverman who often finds her self in Homerian predicaments that s Homerian as in Homerian Simpsonian br br I remember Sarah Silverman from her brief gig on Saturday Night Live in the early 90 s I liked her immediately then and I go out of my way to check out anything she s done br br This show is choke on your food and wet your pants funny Therefore I always fast before watching it and wear adult diapers Check it out
Sarah Silverman is like a totally manic Zooey Deschanel and I think I m in love already Yeah if you loved Jesus is Magic you ll love this If you didn t what the heck is wrong with you Kudos to the Comedy Channel for shoving this in my face My life finally has meaning and Your car smells like farts is my kind of humor I m a happy guy The first episode had me laughing hysterically and I m hungrily looking forward to next week This is like Grease meets South Park Completely outrageous Sarah Silverman is someone I could watch reading the phone book Her delivery is precise and oh so funny She never skips a beat Come to think of it it s not so much her choice of material which is some really good stuff by the way as it is the way she chooses to deliver it Thank you Sarah Silverman Thank you Comedy Channel
I originally scored Sarah s show with a nice fat 8 but I ve struggled a bit with her humor of late and a thin 7 is what s settled in I shall explain br br You will either like Sarah s humor or you won t If you don t I doubt anyone could persuade you You folks know who you are and it s perfectly fine but then you know that too Moving on the first season gave us fantastic bits about Sarah her friends and family and her pursuits in life In one memorable episode she is pulled over by Officer Jay whom she meets for the first time Do you know why I am standing here he asks Because you got all C s in high school she quizzically replies It seemed to be a genuine question That is funny stuff in my book Sarah can come at you from odd angles In another episode her affair with God was notably funny God being petty and jealous added wonderfully to the joke It is clever it is a twisted view but she would show us the truth in the humor and we laughed br br Then came the second season While still not without some new and inventive comedy we seem to have slipped somewhat into banal poop and fart jokes quite simply I get some good laughs here and there but much of it seems like filler while she and the writers struggle to foment some original material Sophomoric and tiresome are the feelings I have for the episodes lately but I have been gutting it out for the gems I do find the turtle and waiting for her to turn it around I was a fan of her Jesus is Magic routine and would like to think that I understand what she is capable of Let s get back to that
For those who think it is strictly potty humor and immaturity you are in fact the mindless one While the show does contain its share of potty jokes it also contains a lot of satirical material and pokes fun at social problems racial barriers clich√© s stereotypes etc You just need to read into some of her material a bit more to get it br br What I also love is that not everything is a punchline For those expecting a formulated joke like Friends I LOVE friends fyi you won t find it here Instead Sarah uses situations and other ways to achieve her humour which is more realistic We don t walk around in this world and have witty punchlines for everything said which is in most comedies Instead the Sarah Silverman Program makes it more realistic in this sense br br So don t take it as mindless humor because it is so much more than that
This show probably won t appeal to everyone Sarah does what she wants she doesn t ask for permission and she doesn t apologize This is a sitcom with zombies robot dinosaurs flying cars and a team of wallet stealing male cheerleaders The star of the show is not a hero she is a spoiled bigoted pervert If you can t appreciate the offbeat humor it offers the show probably isn t for you Everyone should at least give this show a chance It brings together the comedic styling of Sarah Silverman Brian Posehn The Comedians of Comedy Jay Johnston Mr Show Steve Agee Bobcat Goldthwait s Stay and the creative energies of Rob Schrab and Dan Harmon Heat Vision Jack Monster House It also showcases the best talents of the burgeoning online community channel101 com If you re into this show keep an eye out for The Department of Acceptable Media on vh1 this March it ll be drawing from the same talent pool br br Watch Sarah Silverman s show This kind of stuff is the future of entertainment
This show is so incredibly hilarious that I couldn t stop watching the marathon on Comedy Central tonight despite the fact that I ve seen all the episodes previously I ve always regarded Silverman as a huge talent and this is finally a vehicle for that talent to be enjoyed by a wide audience I watch this show and I laugh a very large percentage of the time I can t say that about many TV shows can you This show is finally something new and interesting and most importantly funny This is a show I will never miss and it is one I will buy on DVD as soon as it comes out You owe it to yourself to watch this show I predict a long run for this series And just to be clear the people who are offended by this show just don t get it perhaps they lack the intelligence to comprehend it they should stop making fools of themselves by attacking something they don t understand Anyone who uses the word bigot in reference to Silverman or who claims that she only aims to shock is way off the mark She s exactly the opposite just Google her and you ll quickly see that she s a huge proponent of civil rights etc If you don t know that she s ironically embracing all of these outrageous viewpoints you don t get it And if you don t get it do the rest of us a favor and be quiet about it so we can all enjoy the hilarity
All I can say is if you don t fall in love with Big and Little Edie after watching this movie then you re not human Even after watching it for the first time I was hooked It is a mesmerizing experience that is difficult to describe as I m sure other fans will attest to After watching it you will cry to think that these two wonderful ladies are no longer with us At least we have Grey Gardens to remember them I think we all long to possess the fierce independence these two ladies were graced with Although I have always admired Jackie Onassis Kennedy she does not stay in your heart the way Big and Little Edie do What a rare treat to have know such people I only wish I had
I really can t remember who recommended this but they said it was one of their favorite films It is certainly a strange one like rubbernecking at a highway accident br br Someone said that truth is stranger than fiction and the truth here is something to see I really can t understand how a fictionalized account of this documentary is to be released this year How can you improve on this The aunt and cousin of Jackie Kennedy remove themselves from New York Society and hide in the Hampton s In the process they become recluses and what is best described as crazy cat ladies They would have stayed hidden had not the city move to condemn the property for the filth and the subsequent rescue by Jackie This film was done after that rescue All during you couldn t help but think how bad was it before It s a look at high society from the darker side and it is utterly fascinating
One of the best love stories I have ever seen It is a bit like watching a train wreck in slow motion but lovely nonetheless Big Edie and Little Edie seem a bit like family members after watching this movie repeatedly and are infinitely quotable It s a goddamned beautiful day now will you just shut up The opening explanation of Little Edie s costume only promises that the movie will live on forever and so will Big Edie The World Famous Singer and Little Edie The World Famous Dancer
It s interesting how the train of research can flow I started out looking at an article about Cristo s The Gates in Central Park The article stated that the Maysles had been Cristo s filmographers for years Hmmm Then I got to looking at their body of work I believe one of them has passed on but the other is still filming Cristo and Jean Claude in their stages of creation Grey Gardens sounded very interesting Video Station in Boulder CO is the place to look for the obscure or offbeat and of course they had it in stock DVD and VHS Edith and Edie are women living in the past and oh what a glorious past it was Edith had been well off born a Bouvier married well had several wonderful relationships and became a singer when she was in her forties Her daughter Edie had been a d√©butante a fashion model and had many beaus She never married and at some point in her thirties had come home to recuperate She seems to have a nervous disorder of some kind Worrying too much about things It is only a shadow of the world they live in though because Jackie O came and spruced up the place so her aunt and cousin would not be evicted It is a 28 room mansion that is worn down and worn out But in the film you will notice fresh paint on the walls If you look carefully at the newspaper clippings you see it was very much a dirty mess The outfits Edie comes up with a very clever and creative The viewer gets the impression that Edith likes to go nude but she doesn t in the movie Edith was really quite beautiful and you can see the shadow of her beauty still as she sings Tea for Two Edie too was a beauty in her day and quite attractive at 56 It was a good movie though not for everyone When the cat is urinating behind Edith s portait she states at least someone is doing what they want
I find it very intriguing that Lee Radziwill Jackie Kennedy s sister and the cousin of these women would encourage the Maysles to make Big Edie and Little Edie the subject of a film They certainly could be considered the skeletons in the family closet The extra features on the DVD include several contemporary fashion designers crediting some of their ideas to these oddball women I d say that anyone interested in fashion would find the discussion by these designers fascinating i e Are they nuts Or am I missing something This movie is hard to come by Netflix does not have it Facets does though
When it first came out this work by the Meysels brothers was much criticized and even judged to be exploitation Luckily it is now hailed as a masterpiece of documentary cinema especially now that society has been exposed to real exploitation in what is reality television and the bad evolution of most direct cinema br br Really at first we must say that this isn t really direct cinema it is more cinema verit√© The difference between the two is very slight but it mainly is the fact that in this documentary we are made to feel the presence of the Meysels brothers and they do interact with the characters filmed This as well makes it clear that it is not exploitation The Meysels have been allowed in the house and they are included in what is a very eccentric situation of a very eccentric household And both Edith and Edie just love the idea of being filmed br br It would have been very disappointing had very been shown only a voice of God narration and shallow interviews Here we are given a full portrait of the madness of the house a madness that does seem to go down well with both Edie and her mother Edith Their house is a mess litter and animals everywhere faded colors and furniture all over the house and the constant fights that are constant interactions of reality These two people have lived with each other their whole life and are not fighting in front of the camera because they want the attention but rather because they can t help talking to each other this way They know each other too well to hide their inner feelings there is no need In the end though even as they blame each other for their lives they really love each other deeply Edie says she doesn t want her mother to die because she loves her very much and Edith says that she doesn t want Edie to leave her because she doesn t want to be alone br br But the most interesting aspect of the film is that regardless of their old age the two women can t help be girls They cannot help being one the singer the other the dancer Exhibit all their artistic skills in front of their camera When Edie asks David Meysels rhetorically Where have you been all my life she is really very happy that she finally gets to show the whole world herself and her wonderful showgirls skills A beautiful portrait of stylistic importance and a charm that is highly unlikely to be ever seen again the way only the Meysels and few others could do
Little Edie and Big Edie are characters that anyone can feel compassion for Even though their house was filthy this is somehow understandable considering their mental illness On the message board a poster wrote that Little Edie has the coping skills of an eight year old This reminded me of when in the dramatized 2009 version Big Edie says to Little Edie If you re stuck it s only with yourself These women had everything beauty talent intelligence firm belief in their opinions and actions Perhaps if Little Edie wasn t so hard on herself the first time things didn t work out losing her hair her job and the love of her life she would have made it This somehow ties into what I believe is her mental illness her inability to pick herself up when times are hard and see that good times lie ahead The world will never know what have happened if she didn t listen to her mom s plea Come home Edie Let me take care of you br br Yet these understandably insecure women somehow manage to be brilliant heartbreaking and lovable even in their extremely filthy home These women were extraordinary and their interaction with each other bring humor and sadness When Edie had one of her emotional breakdowns dwelling about what could have been or about how she wants to get out of her home because she feels like a little girl one gets the intense urge to hug her and tell her that everything will be okay br br Great documentary br br 9 10
Grey Gardens is a world unto itself Edith and Little Edie live in near total isolation eating ice cream and liver pate in a makeshift kitchen in their apparently shared bedroom Cats loll about while mother Edith insults her daughter s elocution This is a Tennessee Williams play come to life and should inspire screenwriters and playwrights as the bizarre and overlapping dialogue is 100 real br br The situation in the house reminds me exactly of how my grandmother and her 50 ish daughter lived for a decade other than that they were poor and clean They would bicker all day grandmother talking about her gloriously perfect past while her daughter continually blamed her for missed opportunities with men work and self expression br br This film is a must see for anyone writing a mother daughter relationship of this kind It is sad and voyeuristic but the filmmakers did an amazing job getting the Edies comfortable enough to expose themselves so recklessly It is rare to see true life this way and all the more special considering the context remnants of a powerful family fading into nothingness in the skeleton of their own mansion
I first saw this movie in my plays playwrights course at Tulane I was awed at how beautiful and raw this documentary was It is a sincere look into the unedited reality of a life of solitude The family is fascinating and I thought it really showed Little Edie at her core As a side note My professor even told me that throughout the filming Little Edie became infatuated with one of the camera men The beauty I find comes from the naturalness of the family s dysfunction It is evident in the relationship between mother and daughter that neither could function in society alone and you begin to wish for Little Edie s rehabilitation to society In all the film is gripping in its aesthetic quality and it s portrayal of surprising beauty Two thumbs way up
Grey Gardens was enthralling and crazy and you just couldn t really look away It was so strange and funny and sad and sick and really no words can describe The move Grey Gardens is beyond bizarre I found out about this film reading my Uncle John s Great Big Bathroom Reader by the Bathroom Reader s Institute and it was well worth the rental and bump to the top of my movie watching queue This movie is about the nuttiest most eccentric people that may have ever been filmed One should watch it for their favorite Edie outfits which I am sure include curtains When I get old I almost wish to be just like Big Edie thumbing my nose at normalcy and society
I knew about but had never seen Grey Gardens before I saw the Broadway musical of the same name Friends cautioned me that if I had not seen the movie the musical would not make sense It did but it also prompted me to rent the movie At first I thought it was a train wreck full of strange shrieking characters and it was exceedingly hard to watch But being able to stop it digest it and go back to it made me realize why Grey Gardens is considered to be a memorable documentary br br Both Big Edie and Little Edie are unforgettable and their utter lack of self consciousness is worth witnessing Both of them remain beautiful despite their encroaching age They have a relationship that will chill any woman and undoubtedly some men and make you re examine your own dealings with your mother In an era when reality television and cinema is commonplace it s fascinating to see the Mayleses work from three decades ago and realize what an impact the film must have had br br I echo what other posters have said how were they allowed to slip into such squalor by their family But beyond that how could two people living in the 1970s be able to escape reality in such a complete fashion Or were they simply considered too crazy to be helped I would highly recommend watching this with the commentary track which gave me additional insight into the film
Fascinating yet unsettling look at Edith Bouvier Beale Big Edie and her daughter Little Edie aunt and first cousin to the late Jacquelyn Kennedy Onasis They live in a rodent infested rundown mansion which was considered a health hazard by the city It becomes quite clear very quickly that these two are well past eccentric Little Edie seems to be the most off as she acts with the mindset of a ten year old even though she is actually 53 The content is pretty much made up of two things The first are the conversations were Little Edie lambastes Big Edie for driving away all her potential suitors and ruining her aspiring career as writer actress and dancer These discussions usually become very rhetorical nonsensical and often times amusing The second part consists of long bouts of attempted singing by both parties Each of course thinks their singing is perfect and it s only the other who sounds bad In one amazing scene Big Edie actually physically attacks Little Edie with her cane just to get her to stop her warbling Very captivating yet one gets the feeling that their is some serious exploitation going on here and the subjects are just too far gone to know it The filmmakers seem to treat this like a freak show at the circus coming each day to record and chuckle at whatever bizarre behavior may come about Ultimately this is a sad picture as it shows how the world has simply past these two by Their hopes and dreams as decayed as the mansion they live in Despite their bickering these two need each other more than ever For without the other there would be no refuge from the loneliness Most amazing line comes from Big Edie whose many cats relieve themselves throughout her bedroom Her response to a complaint about the smell is simply unbelievable
Grey Gardens is shocking amusing sad and mesmerizing I watched in amazement as Ediths Jr and Sr bickered and performed while reminiscing of their past Their existence in a dilapidated mansion which they had not left for more than fifteen years is both a comedy and a tragedy This is a film you will not soon forget
I only saw this recently but had been aware of it for a number of years and have always been intrigued by its title It now belongs to me as one of my very favourite films It is hard to describe the incredible subject matter the Maysles discovered but everything in it works wonderfully It has so many memorable images and moments where you feel you are encroaching on a very private world I fell in love with this film and with the characters in it It is as though the filmmakers have cast a spell of the audience and drawn us into the strange world of the eccentric Beales a true aristocratic family It has a tangible atmosphere and I found myself wishing I could be there away from it all cooking my corn on the cob at my bedside table It has an air of sadness that permeates throughout A fall from greatness for this once esteemed family The money had gone but their airs and graces remained as well as their beauty It drew me in from the first frame and long after the film finished I found myself wondering about their fate Wondering that if I took a walk along East Hampton beach I might still hear Old Edie s voice in the night and see the silhouette of Little Edie dancing in the window behind the thick hanging creeper Unforgettable
Excellent film showing the pathetic lives of two nutty old ladies They couldn t live together nor apart Babbling constantly sometimes at the same time they hashed and re hashed the past going on and on about what coulda shoulda woulda I found myself laughing at times but mostly I was taken with how utterly sad and abandoned these two women were See this one
Why should you watch this There are certainly no reasons why you shouldn t watch it Superbly and amusingly directed by Albert and David Maysles Grey Gardens was originally intended to be a film on the gentrification of East Hampton but it turned out to the brothers that it would be more interesting to produce a study on the eccentric life of the two Edith Bouvier Beales the aunt and cousin of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Their life was certainly an amusing one Edith spent most of her day in bed singing operas Edie performing pirouettes and majorette dances with their many cats one was named Ted Z Kennedy The film is interesting because it is both funny and sad Edith died shortly after the film was released in February 1977 aged 82 after experiencing some of the fame that she and Edie received after the film she danced and sang in a nightclub Edie Beale Jr was born in 1925 and is still living in Miami Beach This film is both engaging and spellbounding
The daughter s words are poetry I can t go on another year I got to get to a hotel room I lost my blue scarf in a sea of leaves The marble faun is moving in he just gave us a washing machine That s the deal I m pulverized by this latest thing raccoons and cats become a little bit boring for too long a time any little rat s nest mouse hole I d like better And there is wisdom in the mother s words yes the pleasure is all mine This little book will keep me straight straight as a dye Always one must do everything correctly Where the hell did you come from bring me my little radio I ve got to have some professional music I m your mother Remember me The mother daughter relationship is drawn in this magnificent film This is a Mother s day film
This is why i so love this website I saw this film in the 1980 s on British television Over the years it is one i have wished i knew more about as it has stayed with me as one of the single most extraordinary things i have ever seen in my life With barely a few key words to remember it by i traced the film here and much information including the fact it s about to become an off Broadway musical br br Interestingly unlike the previous comment maker i do not remember finding this film sad or exploitative On the contrary the extraordinary relationship between the mother and daughter stuck in the mind as a testimony of great strength honour and dignity Ironic you may think considering the squalor of their lives Maybe it s because i live in Britain where fading grandeur has an established language in the lives of old money where squalor is often tolerated as evidence of good breeding I saw it as a rare and unique portrayal of enormous spirit deep and profound humour whose utterly fragile and delicately balanced fabric gave it poise and respect In a way i was sorry to see it being discussed as a cult Over the years as it faded in my mind it shone the brightest above all others as a one off brilliant outstanding televisual experience It was such a deeply private expose it seems odd to think of it becoming so public as to be a New York musical But perhaps somewhere the daughter will be amused by such an outcome It is she who will have the last laugh maybe They made a musical out of her before you Jackie O
I took this out arbitrarily from the library the other night having no idea of the film s cult influence or that it is currently being staged as a musical Most of the comments here are on target it s moving funny sad and yes a tad exploitive despite the best intentions of the filmmakers The expanded Chriterion edition is a must for anyone who loved it when it came out br br I think you can also see in little Edie the fall of a class that sort of disappeared you can hear it in old films of Jackie O too people just don t talk like that anymore I think as a documentary it would have been interesting to get more information about how the home fell into disrepute Old Edie at least still seems aware of what s going on to a certain degree couldn t She see the once spectacular home disintegrating br br Yet the film s subject is the life the two women have constructed for themselves now a real life Tennesse Williams one act Well worth your time
Several years ago when I first watched Grey Gardens I remember laughing and finding it hilarious camp Years later I still laugh out loud when I watch it but after many viewings I ve come to see the beauty in the strange twisted relationship between the inseparable Big Edith Bouvier Beale and her daughter Little Edith Bouvier Beale br br Mother and daughter living together in their decaying 28 room East Hampton mansion add a whole new meaning to the term Shabby Chic With innumerable cats raccoons and opossums as roommates this Aunt and Niece of Jackie O allowed filmmakers Albert and David Maysles into their mansion to film them living life day to day The result is a hilarious beautiful sad and moving account of true love and anarchy rule br br The relationship between Big and Little Edie is a testament to the unbreakable bonds of love And their lives an example of drive determination and free will This movie has more to recommend it than I can put down into words It is a rare experience that you must see for yourself br br
This documentary follows the lives of Big and Little Edie Beale a mother and daughter who lived as recluses in their family mansion in East Hampton NY from the mid 50s through the late 70s By the time the filmmakers find them the mansion is falling apart and the women one 78 and the other 56 share a squalid room The older Edie Beale is the aunt of Jackie Kennedy Onassis and the younger is her first cousin The women were originally going to be evicted from the house due to its decrepit condition but Jackie sent them money for repairs so they could keep living there br br At times this movie can seem exploitative as neither woman seems in the best of mental health but at other times the movie is hard to look away from Little Edie blames her mother for her current state and her mother fires back that Edie was never going to be the success she thought she was Little Edie often seems trapped in the past focused on choices she made decades ago and loves showing off pictures from her youth where she clearly was a beautiful debutante Her mother seems more resigned to her fate to live out the rest of her life in terrible conditions There are definite hints of the glamorous life both women once lead from the pictures that show a happy family to the grand portrait of the older Edie next to her bed From what we see of the house most of the rooms in it are empty the walls are cracking and falling apart and Little Edie leaves food in the attic for the racoons to feast on And of course there are numerous cats running around br br At its heart this documentary is incredibly sad While neither woman seems particularly depressed by their lot in life the squalor they live in is utterly awful It s not particularly clear if there is even running water in the house and you get the impression that they have essentially been abandoned by their family br br However as a documentary the film is a wonder to behold and is highly recommended
I saw this film a couple of weeks ago and it s been stuck in my head ever since It stars two spellbinding characters in what is unfortunately a mediocre documentary To get the true story of the Beales I had to wade through all of the DVD s bonus material and commentaries and search the web br br Although the Maysles and their fans not to mention Edith and Edie themselves bristle at the suggestion that this film is exploitative this is exploitation in the truest sense of the word Very little effort is every made to explain the Beales or how they came to the condition they were in the Maysles approach seems to be to just turn the camera on and wait for Edith and Edie to say something outrageous The sound even on the Criterion re release is poor and difficult to follow Although I appreciate this film was made somewhat early in the history of documentary film it s ironic to compare it to Geraldo Rivera s far superior series on the sexual abuse of mentally retarded patients at Willowbrook State School in Staten Island from 1972 four years before Grey Gardens was shot br br To paraphrase a review in the New Yorker there were many things Edith and Edie needed in their lives and a documentary wasn t one of them br br As for Edith and Edie the thing I kept thinking while watching the film was where the hell is their family They were living in dangerous unhealthy unsafe conditions How is it that Jackie O married to one of the richest men on Earth or the wealthy Bouvier family themselves couldn t afford to get Edith and Edie a decent home Or at the very least hire a part time housekeeper or caregiver to come in and keep an eye on them both It s shameful and a lasting disgrace to the entire Bouvier family br br Although this review may sound negative I would strongly recommend Grey Gardens to anyone who enjoys documentaries Perhaps someday someone will come along and do a documentary about this documentary bringing in the rich backstory and afterstory of the Beales and the whole subsection of Hamptons society in the 1970 s
Hey now yours truly TheatreX found this while grubbing through videos at the flea market in almost new condition and in reading the back of the box saw that it was somewhat of a cult hit so of course it came home with me br br What a strange film The aunt and cousin of former first lady Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis live in this decaying 28 room house out on Long Island Suffolk Co and share the house with raccoons cats fleas eyow and who knows what else Suffolk Co was all over them at one point for living in filth and old Jackie herself came by to set things right Anyway this is one strange pair Big Edie and Little Edie Edie the daughter always wears something over her head and dances sings and gives little asides to the camera that rarely make much sense Big Edie the mother age 79 apparently likes to run around naked and while we do get hints of what that might look like thankfully this was tastefully done to the point where we re mercifully spared from that These women talk and talk and talk mostly about the past and it doesn t make a whole lot of sense except to them They live in absolute filth cats doing their business wherever Look that cat s going to the bathroom behind my portrait and one bedroom appears to be their center of operations If I close my eyes and listen to Big Edie s voice it reminds me very much of my own late aunt who was from that area of the country and had that Lawn Guyland accent One scene has Little Edie putting on flea repellent lovely you can see all the cats scratching all the time so the place must have been infested The box refers to these two women as eccentric and I d have to say in this case it is just a euphemism for wacked out of their gourds but this film is not without its moments where you truly feel something for them This is equal parts creepy sad and disgusting but I couldn t stop watching once I started This is not my normal type of flick but I found it to be somewhat fascinating It won t be for everybody though guaranteed
I found Grey Garden s to be a gripping film an amazingly intimate br br look at too eccentrics who basically have the right idea forget br br society and live in a delapidated house with no heating and a huge br br brood of cats and raccoons persuing their own interests rather br br mundainly all the while chattering at the camera br br Big Edie and Little Edie are the two crazies that the Mazles Bros br br have chosen to document They seem like characters out of a br br Fellini film only stranger if that makes any sense Old Edie is br br almost fully bedridden a pile of papers clothes and dirty dishes br br growing around her Little Edie is even more interesting She br br prances around the house always wearing a baboushka like br br headdress around her head completely covering her hair We br br never see her hair throughout the film nor do we ever get a hint br br that she still has much At age fifty eight though she is still br br beautiful and full of life br br In Grey Gardens we get the sense that both of these women s br br lives have become much less than what they once were Little br br Edie is probably the sadder of the two While her mother in her br br earlier years got married made a family lived luxuriously and br br even made some recordings the scene where at 77 she sings br br along with a recording of Tea for Two she made decades ago is br br one of the films best scenes Edie left her promicing career as a br br model to take care of her ailing mother At 58 she still longed to br br find her prince charming If anything Little Edie is still a little girl br br full of dreams of glamour and fame and of domestic and romantic br br bliss that have yet to be fulfilled br br Highlights of the film include the opening moments where Little br br Edie explains her outfit to the camera the tea for two sequence br br the birthday party the climactic argument the grocery deliver br br scene and the scene in the attic The whole thing is incredibly br br candid and unpretencious And it s made all the more remarcable br br since it s all real br br I suggest seeing Grey Gardens back to back with the Kenneth br br Anger short Puce Moment The Criterion DVD is 35 00 but it s br br worth every penny
Grey Gardens 1975 is the Maysles brothers bizarre documentary of Jackie Bouvier Kennedy Onassis eccentric aunt and first cousin who live like pigs in a run down 28 room mansion on East Hampton Long Island Big Edie Bouvier Beale 78 witty and dry and her daughter Little Edie Beale 56 emotionally about 13 a still beautiful woman who once had a promising future live in isolation from the rest of the world except for their many cats and raccoons in the attic They amuse themselves by bickering all day listening to the radio or singing to each other They dont even own a television Their fall from society is amazing to learn of and the viewer is drawn to these two very special although obviously dysfunctional people One of the better documentaries ever made and still a cult classic today
One question that must be asked immediately is Would this film have been made if the women in it were not the aunt and cousin of Jacqueline Lee Bouvier Kennedy Onassis br br The answer is Probably not br br But thankfully they are or were the cousin and aunt of Jackie br br This documentary by the Maysles brothers on the existence one could hardly call it a life of Edith B Beale Jr and her daughter Edith Bouvier Beale Edie has the same appeal of a train wreck you don t want to look but you have to br br Big Edith and Little Edie live in a once magnificent mansion in East Hampton New York that is slowly decaying around them The once beautiful gardens are now a jungle br br Magnificent oil painting lean against the wall with cat feces on the floor behind them and beautiful portraits of them as young women vie for space on the walls next to covers of old magazines br br Living alone together for many years has broken down many barriers between the two women but erected others br br Clothing is seems to be optional Edie s favorite costume is a pair of shorts with panty hose pulled up over them and bits and pieces of cloth wrapped and pinned around her torso and head br br As Edith says Edie is still beautiful at 56 And indeed she is There are times when she is almost luminescent and both women show the beauty that once was there br br There is a constant undercurrent of sexual tension br br Their eating habits are to be polite strange Ice cream spread on crackers A dinner party for Edith s birthday of Wonder Bread sandwiches served on fine china with plastic utensils br br Time is irrelevant in their world as Edie says I don t have any clocks br br Their relationships with men are oh so strange br br Edie feels like Edith thwarted any of her attempts at happiness She says If you can t get a man to propose to you you might as well be dead To which Edith replies I ll take a dog any day br br It is obvious that Edith doesn t see her role in Edie s lack of male companionship Early in the film she states France fell but Edie didn t br br Sometimes it is difficult to hear exactly what is being said Both women talk at the same time and constantly contradict each other br br There is a strange relationship with animals throughout the film Edie feeds the raccoons in the attic with Wonder Bread and cat food The cats and there are many of them are everywhere br br At one point Edie declares The hallmark of aristocracy is responsibility But they seem to be unable to take responsibility for themselves br br This is a difficult film to watch but well worth the effort
I was speechless and devastated after my first viewing of this many parts of GREY GARDENS are very funny and unbelievably surreal documentary of not this really gives Fellini or David Lynch a run for their money in the weirdsville sweepstakes I kept focusing on how these women who are clinically way beyond eccentric reveal their own humanity in the most surprising of ways and I wonder whether their retreat from the world was prompted by something beyond the stuffiness of life in the unreal blue blood universe perhaps some abuse or perhaps simply a streak of defiance and rebellion that spiralled out of their control and took on a life of its own This might be one of the greatest ever films that comes dangerously close to exploitation without going completely over the edge as the Edies do their thing I kept noting things like the empty gin bottles in the rubble strewn bedroom cats urinating on the bed racoons emerging from holes in the walls and the final scene seemed incredibly sad like a child s birthday party gone seriously wrong Very definitely worth seeing and seeking out you ll never forget it but very disturbing
We stumbled upon the documentary Grey Gardens last Sunday and got sucked in without warning Everyone who entered the room became transfixed on the television and the haunting images of Edith and Edie who seemed to be living out their lives in practically one room of a large filthy mansion on the beach eating ice cream and corn on the cob which was cooked on the bedside table and the cat urinating on edith s bed and her unbelievable words i thrive on it the smell We had not seen the beginning and wondered what we were watching and how these aristocratic women managed to get in the position they were in Spellbinding a must see
Trawling through the Sci Fi weeklies section of the local Video Rentals store I was losing hope of finding any good movies I hadn t yet seen Renting Cypher was like a punt on a possibly very lame horse My son is so jaded with current B Science Fiction that he hasn t bothered seeing this yet br br It must be noted I didn t see anything about Cypher when it was released in Australia It must have been very quiet or I just missed it br br Well this WAS a really pleasant surprise This is also no B movie It s not a blockbuster of the epic variety and doesn t try to be more a quiet movie that needs to be seen several times for it s plot to be fully savoured br br The special effects are powerfully presented when they are used my only complaint is the super helo is a leetle obviously CGI at first view but they get it right at it s 2nd appearance that aside everything else is top notch In any case the affects are secondary br br I won t give anything away about the plot The plot structure has a Russian Doll aspect a little reminiscent of Basic Instinct though with very different content br br Just I will say that Choosing Jeremy Northam for the lead was a master stroke The actor was born in Cambridge ENGLAND and his accent for this film hits the ear as a sort of extremely forced New England dialect it s a tad off key See the final twist of the plot and you ll see why that is such a brilliant choice And Lucy Liu is also just right with her will she kiss me will she shoot me edge br br I rarely watch movies several times within days this is one of them
Don t read anything about this movie especially nothing that could contain any spoilers Just watch this awesome movie without knowing anything about it and you ll have a really great experience If you like to see an intelligent twisted story Go get the DVD and you ll truly not be disappointed Cypher is not really a sci fi movie more a psycho thriller settled in the environment of globalized business It s about corporate secrets how big companies spy each others research departments and the methods used by them The actors do a great performance and the overall visual style of the movie provides a perfect mode of coldness Cypher is much deeper more complex and what belongs the story and the ending also much much more satisfying than Vincenzo Natali s other movies Cube and Nothing Actually it s one of the best movies I ve ever seen and that s something I really don t say this about every fifth well made flick Sorry can t tell you anything more about this movie without risking to hurt your experience Just give it a chance
Cypher is a cleverly conceived story about industrial espionage set in America in the not too distant future While thematically not complex this film does offer many different perspectives about personal loyalty ruthlessness and corporate conspiracy To a certain extent this film also attempts to represent modern corporate groups and companies as being indifferent to the risks their contract employees take on their behalf br br The film starts off with a somewhat mediocre salary man Morgan Sullivan Jeremy Northam who applies to the Digicorp group to work as an undercover operative After an initial briefing with Digicorp s Security Chief Sullivan is then given a new identity Jack Thursby and sent to a business conference with the task of recording the speeches given by various spokesmen concerning the marketing strategies of each of their respective companies Upon successfully completing his first assignment Sullivan Thursby is sent on further missions to obtain the same type of information previously gathered However on one of his business trips he inadvertently runs into a woman named Rita Foster Liu whom he had met on his previous assignment and from there things go extremely topsy turvy The implications of a diabolical conspiracy involving Digicorp s espionage program begin to emerge and Sullivan is forced to go deep cover at one of Digicorp s main competitors thus becoming a double agent involved in an intense rivalry between the two companies br br SPOILERS END HERE br br What I liked most about this film was the efficient use of lighting and shadows in a lot of the scenes Vivid lighting was used in mainly domestic household settings while a lot of shadows and dark coloring were used for settings involving deception and cover up I was also very impressed with Jeremy Northam Not too often have I seen him in the lead role and the fact that he plays a disenchanted married man straight out of Wisconsin was brilliant Personally I think he s one of the many under used actors in the industry who hasn t been given more challenging roles Lucy Liu was also incredible in her part and gave the movie its real cloak and dagger tone Additionally the rest of the supporting cast did a superb job however my only complaint was that some characters could have been explored more to make the plot and closure a little more complicated For example I would have loved to see what would have happened if Jack Thursby had developed a more intimate relationship with his second wife Overall this is a cleverly developed cloak and dagger story that keeps you guessing to the very end about personal and professional loyalties and whether anyone in the entire film can be trusted With a smart and stylish soundtrack and great camera work this film provides a scary look at how corporations might operate in the near future I m surprised that I had never watched this hidden gem before This is a brilliant not too overly complicated spy thriller and therefore I m giving it a 9 out of 10
Cypher is a clever effective and eerie film that delivers Its good premise is presented well and it has its content delivered in an effective manner but also in a way the genre demands Although one could immediately label the film a science fiction there is a little more to it It has it s obvious science fiction traits but the film resembles more of a noir detective feel than anything else which really adds to the story br br The film overall plays out like it s some kind of nightmare thus building and retaining a good atmosphere We re never sure of what exactly is going on we re never certain why certain things that are happening actually are and we re not entirely sure of certain people similar to having a dream the ambiguity reigns over us all hero included and I haven t seen this pulled off in such a manner in a film before bar Terry Gilliam s Brazil Going with the eeriness stated earlier Cypher presents itself with elements of horror as well as detective noir and science fiction giving the feeling that there s something in there for everyone and it integrates its elements well br br There is also an espionage feeling to the film that aids the detective side of the story The mystery surrounding just about everyone is disturbing to say the least and I find the fact that the character of Rita Foster Liu who is supposed to resemble a femme fatale can be seen as less of a threat to that of everything else happening around the hero People whom appear as friends actually aren t people who say they re helping are actually using and those that appear harmless enough are actually deadlier than they look Despite a lot of switching things around twisting the plot several times and following orders that are put across in a way to make them seem that the world will end if they re not carried out the one thing that seems the most dangerous is any romantic link or connection with Lucy Liu s character and she s trying to help out The film maintains that feeling of two sides battling a war of espionage spying and keeping one up on its employees and opponents The whole thing plays out like some sort of mini Cold war something that resembles the U S A and the U S S R in their war of word s heyday and it really pulls through given the black bleak often CGI littered screen that I was glued to br br What was also rather interesting and was a nice added touch was the travel insert shot of certain American states made to resemble computer microchips as our hero flies to and from his stated destinations significant then how the more he acts on his and Foster s own motivation this sequence disappears because he s breaking away from the computerised repetitive controlled life that he s being told to live and is branching out br br Cyhper is very consistent in its content and has all the elements of a good film To say it resembles the first Jason Bourne film only set in the sci fi genre isn t cutting it enough slack but you can see the similarities despite them both being released in the same year Like I mentioned earlier there feels like there is something in this film for everyone and if you can look past the rather disappointing ending that a few people may successfully predict you will find yourself enjoying this film
Cypher is a movie well worth seeing because it s not the run of the mill Sci Fi flick The artistic approach is painted with dark scenes and a kind of macro view of what s going on The close up camera view is how the director keeps the plot illusive The sci fi aspect of the movie is secondary to the plot of the movie The technology used in the movie isn t overly impressive however the director makes good use of the props br br The character development is intentionally shallow The main character Jeremy Northam decides to immerse himself into the world of espionage It s up to the audience to figure out his enigmatic character and it s the enigma that keeps the audience interested right to the very end
Damn I ve seen this movie for at least 4 times now and I still don t get bored watching it br br The visuals are so good and together with the music which is totally awesome and perfect fitting this movie is mind blowing to me br br The CGIs are quite bad IMHO but the whole visuals with the black and white feeling about it and the totally sterile interiors were just Just a genius perfect combination for such a movie The whole feeling about the feeling is indescribable the plot is so good br br However although the movie had little flaws like e g sometimes I thought the movie was a bit too slow but I don t mean the scenic parts by that I totally loved those br br Also I got distracted very often by the totally complex story like when he is in the underground bunker like thing of digicorps where all their data is saved and has this conversation with the guy down there but that may also just be me D And the end could have been displayed somehow more emphasized they should have made the getting back true memory part a bit longer and louder but then again without all these flaws the movie would have been so good i would have never stopped watching it again and again
This movie is a Gem because it moves with soft but firm resolution br br I caution viewers that although it is billed as a Corporate Spy thriller and Ms Liu is there it moves at a deftly purposeful yet sedate pace It s NOT about explosions car chases or flying bullets You must be patient and instead note the details here It s sedate because that s what the Main Character is The viewer has to WATCH him and Think as this story unfolds br br I will not give spoilers because that destroys the point of watching The plot is what you ve read from the other postings an average white collar guy seeking change and adventure signs on for a corporate spy job Just go somewhere and secretly record and transmit inside data br br Take it from there br br This movie starts at a surreal walk with a background tang of corporate disillusionment that entwines itself with quintessential underlying suburban paranoia br br Then it begins to accelerate br br The acting on all parts is superb and yes some of the acts are caricature characters But they all fit and they entertain And the light piano rhyme in the background is just perfect as the soft soft key sinister theme All is not right at the beginning br br And at the end All is not what it seems br br Get comfortable and turn the lights down to watch this one and turn up the sound This movie wants you to LISTEN
This is my first comment This is a fantastic movie I watched it all by luck one night on TV At first 5 minutes i thought it was a B movie but afterward i understood what an amazing product this was br br I suggested to some friends to see the movie only to tell me that it was a bad B movie How wrong Superficial critiques br br I think that the movie is almost a product of genius The well known director made an excellent job here and it is a shame to tell that he was out of the game all this time
I ve seen this movie at theater when it first came out some years ago and really liked it a lot But i still wanted to see it again this year to check if it is still good compared to movies coming out now and i wan tell it s one the best movies i ve ever seen in my life br br What you need to know is that you don t have to miss any minute of this movie if you don t completely follow the action you will get lost and you will not understand the end br br The end is what makes this movie so good you can t expect it br br Congratulations to the Producer
Who can watch a movie look at Lucy Liu and not be overjoyed That woman is amazingly beautiful a talented actress That s a tough combination to find now a days And Jeremy Northam i heard his name plenty of times but i never really noticed him My advice to Hollywood is use him more br br now about the movie I watched it in one of my graveyard shift I don t recommend that to anyone It s a bit to complicated mysterious for that i still can t believe i didn t see the ending coming I m not gonna say what cause that ll spoil the hole movie although saying this is spoilment enough br br now i m suppose to cast my vote about this movie I love the dark mystic story the actors did a good job i love the directors natali work in the past There s not a big audience for this kind of thing that s also pretty risky you know what i m just gonna give this work a 8 cause everybody should see this Then again 1 point deduction cause there is always space for improvement

It s actually a good thing Sean Connery retired as James Bond as I m sure he wouldn t be able to keep up in the nowadays spying business where fast cars have been replaced with hi tech brainwashing techniques and gorgeous women are considered to be less sexy than advanced computer equipment Cypher is a pretty inventive Sci Fi thriller that often evokes feelings of fright claustrophobia despite being utterly implausible You know the trend in these types of movies nothing is what it seems and just when you think figured out the convoluted plot the writers make sure to insert a new twist that confuses everyone again The events in Cypher supposedly take place in the most prominent regions of the computer world where the major companies don t really do a lot apart from trying to steal each other s thunder Company Digisoft literally spends millions brainwashing people and providing them with a new identity only to let them infiltrate as spies in their biggest competitor the Sunways Corporation Sunways on the other hand constantly tries to unmask the Digisoft rats and recruit them again as double spies In between this whole unprofitable business stands Morgan Sullivan a seemingly colorless thirty something employee who s been selected by Sebastian Rooks the √ºber spy to diddle the secret policies of BOTH companies Trust me it s actually less complicated than it sounds and director Vincenzo Natali the dude from Tube carefully takes his time to introduce all the important and less important characters The first half of the film is rather reminiscent to the sadly underrated John Frankenheimer gem Seconds starring Rock Hudson as it also deals with erasing identities and drastically altering your former life style Even the set pieces seem to come straight out of that 60 s film with loads of empty white rooms and eerie corridors that seem to be endless There s also plenty of great action and suspense most notably when Morgan soberly experiences how the Digisoft crew inspects the results of their brainwashing techniques during boring conventions The middle section of the film drags a little mainly because you already realize that it s all just building up towards multiple misleading plot twists and I hoped for a slightly more grim portrayal of the not so distant future Jeremy Northam is perfectly cast and the adorable Lucy Liu is convincingly mysterious as the foxy lady who appears to be on his side Regular director s choice David Hewlett has the most memorable supportive role as the uncannily eccentric Suways engineer Virgil C Dunn Cypher is well made and adrenalin rushing Sci Fi entertainment highly recommended to people who fully like to use their brain capacity from time to time
This movie is about this wimpy guy who decides to become a spy for a glamorous high tech company named Digicorp This wimpy guy Morgan Jeremy Northam is unhappy with his miserable suburban life and his demanding wife so he decides to become a spy He is suppose to go to conventions from other high tech companies and find out all the companies plans Instead Morgan finds himself attracted to a beautiful woman played by Lucy Liu and pretty much being double crossed by these two companies that force him to become a double agent How will Morgan get himself out of this Can he trust the beautiful but mysterious Rita Foster played by Lucy Liu And more importantly can Morgan make it out alive Wow What a nifty movie I was completely sucked in after 15 minutes of watching this movie It is very suspenseful and you can feel Morgan s fear and confusion as he is doing his best to stay alive The scene where they put this horrible contraption on Morgan s head to brainwash him is brilliantly creepy and frightening Morgan slowly goes through a personality transformation that is not so readily apparent until you think about it after the film is finished From a wimpy guy with bad hair and glasses he turns into a man actively fighting for his life br br The ending wow the ending is incredible The twist is so much fun It left me gasping and cheering like crazy Good performances from all around especially from Jeremy Natham Lucy Liu and Nigel Bennett br br I highly recommend this film
If you came into the film with expectations throw them away now because no amount of hype will do this film justice br br To categorize this film into a single genre would be criminal It s a spy thriller has elements of noir bits and pieces of action science fiction and cyberpunk all tied together with a brilliant narrative mind bending plot twists and gorgeous cinematography br br A lot of the comments here have centered around it being derivative both in good and bad ways of other movies But as they say every story cribs from Shakespeare so once you can get past that you re in for a hell of a ride br br You will need to suspend your disbelief at some points and while the set never becomes unbelievable there are portions read the elevator which suffer from a low budget and somewhat cheesy visuals Don t misconstrue that to mean it s on the same level as cheesy Sci Fi channel movies though because this is on a much higher level br br If you re looking for action you should turn away This is pure psychology But if you re willing to sit down and devote a good 90 minutes of your life to a novel cinematic experience by all means DO IT NOW Watch this movie now before it becomes cool to have seen it
Canadian director Vincenzo Natali took the art house circuit by storm with the intriguing and astonishingly intelligent Cube which is my personal favourite SF film of the 90s It framed the basic conceit of a group of strangers trapped in a maze shaped like a giant cube shot entirely on one set and took this idea in fascinating directions br br I ve been eagerly awaiting Natali s follow up and although its taken five years for him to mount another project I m delighted to say it was worth the wait Cypher is a fascinating exploration of one man s place in the world and how through a completely logical chain of events finds himself in a situation beyond his control br br I don t want to reveal too much about the plot because one of the joys of Cypher is the different avenues it takes us down It is so refreshing in this day and age to see a SF film that has more than one idea in it s head Cypher is such a film br br Morgan Sullivan Jeremy Northam one of the blandest people to ever walk the planet is hired by the company DigiCorp They send him to different parts of America to record different seminars To his bewilderment they are unbelievably boring Covering topics as mundane as shaving cream and cheese br br While Morgan is waiting for one seminar he runs into Rita Foster an impeccably cast Lucy Liu the definition of an ice maiden She gives him the brush off but there is something to her he finds irresistible That s not too surprising considering the dry marriage he is in br br When Rita turns up at another one of Morgan s seminars she tells him his life is not what it appears And I m not saying anything more about the plot To do so would cheapen the impact the rest of the film has on us as well as the tortuous path that s so much fun to follow br br As with Cube Natali shows quite a talent for encompassing seemingly ordinary people taking them out of the familiar and basically seeing what will happen when they re thrust into the unknown And Cypher follows similar patterns But it s not a carbon copy of Cube It has it s own inspiration br br Cypher is a film that has more in common with conspiracy thrillers and paranoia stories One of the great things about Cypher is the way these themes creep into the story without your knowledge When Morgan realises his false identity is a piece of a much larger puzzle it s as much of a shock to us as it is to him br br One thing that distinguishes Cypher from Cube is how much more polished it is Where Cube was confined to a minimalist setting and a shoestring budget with a cast of unknowns Cypher is also on a low budget but Natali economises it as much as he can allowing him to broaden the horizon and launching Morgan on an amazing journey through the labyrinth of his own identity br br Natali s direction is exceptional with a deft hand on the reins There are some amazing camera angles from above such as the enormity of the DigiCorp building as a vast robust office block in conjunction to the insignificant speck that is Morgan standing outside All the colour appears to have been bled out of the picture which compliments the tone of the film perfectly as a modern day film noir br br The acting is uniformly excellent throughout Jeremy Northam is a sympathetic figure from his loveless marriage to questioning his own identity His performance is excellent because it s so modulated He literally seems to transform right before our very eyes From a clinical spineless wimp to a confident man who will do anything to preserve his new identity br br David Hewlett puts in a welcome appearance who made such an impact in Cube He resides in a secret silo that looks like it was borrowed from Men in Black His scene is one of the best because it s an exercise in carefully calculated suspense and paranoia He is a supposed expert in identifying double agents and it s a fantastic piece of writing brilliantly acted by Hewlett All he has to do is look at Morgan and we re drawn into his complex mind game br br But it s Lucy Liu who s the scene stealer here Too often she is cast in films where her potential is not utilised to full effect But in Cypher she is finally given a character that fits her like a glove Rita is an aloof guarded femme fatale that Liu inhabits with relish I perked up every time she appeared because she is always in control and can reduce a room to silence by the power of her icy stare alone br br Things come to a very gratifying end that doesn t conclude on an ambiguous note the way Cube did But Morgan deserves his happy ending After he s been put through the ringer like this I cheered for him in the final scene It s a perfect final moment because it comes as a ray of sunshine after a gloomy 90 minutes br br Cypher succeeds on all counts Engaging shocking always entertaining it s everything that Total Recall wanted to be but wasn t And it comes as a refreshing antidote to the overwhelming and inexplicable Matrix br br A fine follow up from Natali And now I m a committed fan of the man Superb stuff
Director Vincenzo Natali s Cypher is a complex and imaginative thriller which although requiring some suspension of belief and plenty of concentration manages to be a thoroughly entertaining experience br br Morgan Sullivan Jeremy Northam a stay at home husband with an overbearing wife decides to add a bit of spice to his mundane existence by getting a job as an industrial spy at high tech company Digi Corp His job is to travel to conferences across the country under the assumed identity of Jack Thursby and secretly broadcast the speeches given back to his bosses via a nifty little electronic pen gizmo br br In reality however the speeches are merely a cover for far more nefarious activities Morgan along with his fellow conference attendees is being brainwashed The drugged water they are drinking puts them into a temporary coma during which they are told to forget their pasts and permanently adopt their new identities Once they are totally convinced that they are someone else they are told to apply for jobs with rival companies where they are able to indulge in corporate espionage without suspicion br br But Digi Corp s plans are scuppered by the intervention of shady operative for hire Rita Foster Lucy Liu who opens Morgan s eyes to what is really happening She gives Morgan an antidote to the mind altering drugs so that he can resist the brainwashing techniques She also warns him that if Digi Corp suspects that he does not fully believe he is Jack Thursby then he will be eliminated Morgan plays along and applies for a job at rival business Sunways br br However arriving at his new workplace he is given a polygraph test and is immediately rumbled as a spy Fortunately the bosses at Sunways see this as an ideal opportunity to feed false data to Digi Corp and Morgan becomes a double agent br br From hereon in things get progressively more complicated the plot twists and turns and poor old Morgan ends up not being able to trust anyone In an exciting finale all eventually becomes clear but only if you ve been following events very carefully br br Director Natali handles proceedings confidently and certainly has a great ability to produce a classy looking film for a relatively low budget He manages to get some great performances from his talented cast Jeremy Northam in particular is fantastic his portrayal of the initially somewhat nervous Morgan is played to perfection br br Cypher is another fascinating movie from a director who is willing to take chances and I eagerly look forward to his forthcoming projects High Rise and Necropolis
Listen I don t care what anybody says as Cypher is nothing less than a 5 star movie Cypher is not I repeat not a B movie Cypher is an absolute masterpiece Suffice it to say I am a connoisseur of the world s finest spy films and this film is nothing less than top flight I cannot overemphasis how phenomenal this movie is Cypher is one of the best spy movies ever conceived and ever made The technology in this movie is over the horizon of spacetime In fact I must admit that Cypher completely surprised the hell out of me In fact I ve recommended this movie to my colleagues more than any other movie Other critics of whom some downplayed the movie have no idea as to what the hell they re talking about Don t listen to the haters And actually for the most part reviews of Cypher have been largely positive And it should be noted that Cyher is not only a good movie but it is also a fantastic movie Cypher is the kind of movie that s so advanced and so magnificently crafted that it s over the heads of most critics and all the cynics There is nothing wrong with or cheap about Cypher whatsoever Again the cinematography the backdrops the technology the storyline and the acting are all 100 world class top notch Naturally I won t give anything away This is not a spoiler And though it is the contention of some critics that Cypher should have been in movie theaters I believe quite the opposite Cypher is a movie that seems to have been just right for DVD release only and not in a bad way Cypher has got to be the greatest underground spy flick ever to hit the shelves Blade Runner 1984 Brave New World Total Recall Logan s Run Jason Bourne and Impostor and Deja Vu look out Cypher equally earns the distinction of being placed in the AONN Multimedia Research 5 Star Eternal Spy Movie Hall of Fame Cypher is counterespionage at it s absolute best Hands down and hats off Nothing is what it seems and truth is stranger than fiction The future is now
In a near future the ordinary man above any suspicious from the suburb Morgan Sullivan Jeremy Northam is hired by Digicorp a huge corporation to be assigned as a spy and steal secrets from their competitors Sunways Along his training Morgan is brainwashed assumes a new identity of Jack Thursby and travels to boring lectures In one of them he is approached by the beautiful and mysterious Rita Foster Lucy Liu who advises him that nothing is how it seems to be Morgan acknowledges a new reality where he does not know who can be trusted br br The unknown Cypher was a great surprise for me This movie has not been released in Brazil but the engaging and exciting story is quite complex with many plot points and with great screenplay direction and performances In the very last twist I recalled Arnold Schwarzenegger s Total Recall This movie certainly deserves to be watched more than once and I really did not like the last scene when the independent spy disposes the disputed disc in the sea In only know the director Vicenzo Natali from the fantastic Cube and this second work I see is also stunning My vote is eight br br Title Brazil Not Available
This is a superbly imaginative low budget Sci fi movie from cult director Vincenzo Natali The film plays out like a crossing of Phillip K Dick with Hitchcock and Cronenberg and the film takes on a unique feel like nothing you would have seen The film is superbly shot I love the cinematography in this it feels fresh and original Plot wise the film explores similar themes to films like Total Recall Dark City and the Matrix and its pretty staple Sci fi stuff Morgan Sullivan Jeremy Northam is a suburbanite who is bored with his life and has decided to take a job as a company spy for Digicorp a large technological corporation He meets up with a recruitment officer at the beginning who brings Sullivan on board and instructs him on what he has to do It basically involves going to conferences of rival companies and recording them via a satellite transmission device disguised as a pen It also means that he must take on a different persona and keep it a secret from his wife After his first job things become strange his habits change his personality begins to differ and he suffers pains in his neck and headaches as well as nightmares He encounters a beautiful woman named Rita Foster played by an intriguingly cast Lucy Liu he takes an instant attraction to However when he goes in his next job and sees her again she reveals herself to be an agent of some sort who reveals that his job is not quite what it seems He finds out later on that he and the rest of the people attending the conference all work for Digicorp The conferences are all covers to allow the company men to brainwash their spies Sullivan whose alternate name is Jack Thursby has been given an antidote to Digicorps drugging and while the rest of the spies at the latest conference drift off into what seems like a brain dead day dream while the speakers drone on the speakers send all the attendants to sleep via subliminal messages suddenly the rooms lights turn off and workers at Digicorp come in shining lights in all the occupants eyes to ensure they are not conscious and then in a fairly nightmarish situation they bring in head sets for each member which send messages into the brain and brainwash the precipitants into believing they are someone else Digicorp are using these people as puppets and creating personalities and lives for these people while wiping their own existence Sullivan now must pretend that he entirely believes he is now Jack Thursby Digicorp want to steal information from their rivals Samways and they want their own puppets to do it they now effectively control what these spies do except for Sullivan When Samways get a hold of Sullivan and discover he has not actually been brainwashed they decide to use him as a pawn to spy on Digicorp make Sullivan a double agent They know that Digicorp have sent Thursby to them to work his way into Samways and work his way up the system until he can get into a situation to download important company information that could shut the company down Samways realises he had been planted and decide they will play along with Digicorp and allow Thursby to infiltrate their databanks but they will give Digicorp a dodgy disc that will ruin their system The plot begins to twist and turn as both companies are using Sullivan as a pawn He is stuck in the middle and Rita Foster is a mystery as he tries to work out why she is helping him When a mysterious third party becomes involved the person it is revealed that Foster works for Sullivan must decide whether to go to this freelance agent who could guarantee him a new life and safety or to stick with one of the companies he works for The tension all builds to a stonking climax as it seems just about everyone wants to dispose of him once his usefulness has expires The cast are great Northam is superb and the subtlety in his performance is excellent He brings a great visual aspect to his performance his eyes tell a story and we see a great subtle change as his character changes from Sullivan to Thursby Lucy Liu is just sexy beyond belief and her presence gives a great dynamic to the film because it seems strange casting but works because of that fact The rest of the cast are also good br br Director Natali whose previous film was the cult classic sci fi flick Cube has a real visual flair He paces the film superbly as well and has given it a great look For a low budget film it features some imaginative visual effects and although the CGI isn t great it never begins too much of a centre piece to effect the film negatively The film really does bring feelings of The Matrix and other great sci fi films it is up there with them The plot nearly becomes too convoluted at times but in truth that helps in a film like this that is where the Cronenberg and Lynch influence is evident The film has you constantly working out what is going on and genuinely surprises as it goes along This is overall an obvious cult classic and I can see this being incredibly popular when it is released in the states 1 2 br br
This Filmfour funded Sci Fi movie is most definitely a must see While it takes huge influence from The Manchurian Candidate and offers nothing new or original plot wise it s handled with the utmost skill that it comes off as being fresh and inventive despite it being basically a re run of an earlier film It s good to know that films like this are still being made even if they aren t getting wide releases and Cypher is refreshing for that reason The plot twists and turns which gives it an element of paranoia and also serves in keeping the audience on the edge of their seat while trying to figure out the meaning of Cypher s mystery The plot follows Morgan Sullivan a bored suburban man that decides to take a job with Digicorp that involves him listening to speeches from several rival companies and recording them for reasons to him unknown However his job is interrupted when he meets a mysterious young lady known as Rita br br This film features a number of stark white backgrounds that give it a very surreal edge and blend well with it s apocalyptic imaging of the future This gives the film a very odd look that sets it apart from the majority of other films of the same type with it s only real close affiliate being Kubrick s A Clockwork Orange The plot is also very efficient and ditches character development in favour of the more stylish and more thrilling plot developing You never quite know where you are with the plot which serves in making it all the more intriguing The acting is largely good with a largely unknown cast backing up the team of stars Jeremy Northam and Lucy Lui Northam very much looks the part of the quiet and disheartened man at the centre of the tale and does well with his role Lucy Lui is an actress that has a resume that doesn t quite fit her talent but she has a look about her that just fits this movie br br Cypher is far from perfect as some of the sequences are illogical and at times it can be inconsistent but on the whole if you want an inventive recent Sci Fi film Cypher is the way to go
Jeremy Northam s characterization of the stuttering mild mannered bookish Morgan Sullivan and watching him let loose bits and pieces of his real identity under the influence of single malt scotches and under the spell of Lucy Liu s presence is brilliantly crafted and a joy to watch His offering her a cigarette at the bar is an old habit done without thinking or even asking and he becomes lost in her face neck and lips No matter the brainwashing love has a way of persevering Love also cannot be brainwashed in with either of his two fake wives In gradual stages he begins to dispense with his glasses to walk and talk differently and even his face looks different as the movie progresses The music is fantastic hypnotic sexy and appropriately driving at times The extensive use of black and white and grey tones makes this almost a sci fi film noir in the tradition of many classic thrillers I would have liked to have seen more vulnerability in Lucy Liu s portrayal whenever she sees him in his various frazzled states the man she loves and for whom she is performing a mission based on blind faith some restrained vulnerability and flashes of genuine sympathy and concern would have made it a less one dimensional performance on her part She is just no match for Northam s talents but all in all I thoroughly enjoyed this film and would enjoying knowing about other screenplays written by the same author
You ll notice by the stars I ve given this GREAT film that before you see it the first time is implied I had never before heard of this film and happened across it just because this week and last was a very slow rental experience not much great coming in I m not sure how this movie slipped past me I love Lucy Liu and Jeremy Northam is great too Still it did br br This movie is an awesome example of what to do if you don t have a large budget It had just the right amount of plot and dialog to make it very interesting and keep the viewer in the dark just enough The entire film is you the viewer trying to figure out the plots many twists and turns I would have given this film 10 10 however some of the shots were pretty fake looking I don t hold that against this film too much but I don t think it deserves a perfect score br br Lucy Liu is beautiful and mysterious as always I think she s pretty underrated as a serious talent Nevermind her beauty which is difficult she really takes her roles seriously and doesn t rest on her appearance to drive her through scenes of sophisticated emotion And she can seem cold and even lifeless if needed as well br br Jeremy Northam does really well at first as quite a geeky corporate rat willing to run through any maze to prove himself However as he changes throughout the film it s like night and day I know some fans of Clive Owen Jude Law or other hopefuls to become the next James Bond will hate me for this but Northam would could should fit that bill He s suave and cultured He s got a great Bond posture and voice I think he too can be cold if the situation calls for it and rather down to Earth as well br br Great film and definitely this movie buff recommends it to be seen at least once if you like corporate espionage films
There was a stylish approach to this film on the part of director Vincenzo Natali with interesting camera angles and effective close ups It was also refreshing to see Jeremy Northam and Lucy Liu given leading roles and expanding their range as performers This film also included one of the most imaginative escape scenes in recent years The efforts of the director and the actors combined in an effective thriller br br Although the plotting of the film was convoluted the story progressed very clearly as the layers of corporate greed and skullduggery were revealed br br In 1949 George Orwell suggested in his famous novel 1984 that the future would be ruled by the totalitarian State which would control minds and diminish human liberty It was interesting that in this intriguing futuristic film it was not the State but rather the corporate world that controlled and devalued the human worker
When The Matrix appeared in 1999 and questioned existence and identity it was expected that a lot of movies would use it as inspiration That didn t really happen surprisingly and it took till 2002 for a movie of similar theme to appear But to say Cypher is a clone would be to its discredit br br The story is of a Morgan Sullivan who applies for a job with a high flying techno company called Digicorp His job is to be a spy and gain information about a rival company while under an assumed and false identity His home life is perfectly normal but he has to lie to his wife about what he s actually doing However things start to take conspirital turns and before he knows what s going on he starts to question who he actually is This is not helped by a strange woman who turns up br br Twists and turns at every direction keep you absolutely fascinated and at no point does anything ever seem contrived or unbelievable br br It s an enthralling journey through a not too distant future and with good acting all round will keep you on the edge of your seat br br Highly recommended
A major moneymaker for RKO Radio Bombardier stars Pat O Brien and Randolph Scott as trainers at a school for bomber pilots O Brien and Scott argue over teaching methods while their students vie for the affections of Anne Shirley O Brien s methods prove sound during a bombing raid over Tokyo Scott and his crew are captured and tortured by the Japanese but the mortally wounded Scott manages to set fire to a gas truck providing a perfect target for his fellow bombardiers Stylistically Bombardier is one of the most schizophrenic of war films with moments of subtle poignancy the death of trainee Eddie Albert alternating with scenes of ludicrous Yellow Peril melodrama the Japanese literally hiss through their teeth as they torture the helpless Americans Though it can t help but seem dated today Bombardier remains an entertaining propaganda effort the film is sometimes erroneously listed as the debut of Robert Ryan who d actually been appearing before the cameras since 1940 br br Anyone interested in obtaining a copy of this film please contact me at iamaseal2 yahoo com
I wasn t sure at first if I was watching a documentary propaganda film or dramatic presentation I guess given the time of production it was a mix of all three br br Admittedly the dramatic plot was somewhat predictable But you had a sense that there would be some interesting scenes as the movie went on We were able to witness what appeared to be realistic training regimens and equipment br br Where this movie came together for me was closer to the end The scenes had a realism at least as I perceived it that I haven t encountered often before You could place yourself in the action and imagine the thoughts of the young combatants This was mixed in with the usual problems of portraying passable Japanese soldiers at a time when you might think real Japanese actors would be somewhat scarce br br The movie is excellent as a source of the state of the American mindset in 1943 as the war waged with Japan Also of interest was a dig at the Japanese with respect to the help the USA gave Japan in past years
There were a lot of films made by Hollywood during the war years that were designed to drum up support for our troops from the public Seen today some might dismiss them or just see them as propaganda which they technically are but of a positive sort and meant to unify the nation This film is a pretty effective and entertaining example of the genre having a pretty realistic script and good production values Pat O Brien plays pretty much the same character he played in MANY other films you know the tough talking hard driven but swell guy Randolph Scott is as always competent and entertaining and the rest of the extras are excellent look for a young Robert Ryan as one of the bombardiers in training While the story is reminiscent of several other movies about our pilots and crews the film is well crafted enough to make it interesting and not too far fetched That it perhaps except for the very end where the film is a bit over the top but also VERY satisfying About the only serious negative and this is mostly for nitpickers is that some of the stock footage is somewhat sloppily integrated in the film and nuts like me who are both history teachers and airplane lovers will probably notice this all others probably won t notice
I enjoyed watching Cliffhanger at the beginning when that woman Sarah was full of terror when she was slipping i thought that was a terrifying scene as i would think that when you see that see your nerves in your body get to you because it makes you get full of fright and your heart beats faster I did like watching Cliffhanger i think Silvestar Stallone is a great actor and i think he ll be known as playing Rambo and Rocky
This movie is directed by Renny Harlin the finnish miracle Stallone is Gabe Walker Cat and Mouse on the mountains with ruthless terrorists Renny Harlin knows how to direct actionmovie Stallone needed this role to get back on track Snowy mountain is very good place for action movie and who is better to direct movie where is snow ice cold and bad weather than finnish man Action is good Music in the film is spectacular The bad guy is John Litghow other stars Micheal Rooker The portrait of serialkiller Janine Turner Strong Medicine The is placed in beautiful place and it is very exciting movie Overall good movie br br Remember Extreme √§√§li√∂t special collectors edition with good extras Comig soon in Finland straight to video
Good action show but nothing new This one took place high in the mountains which showed some nice scenery and such One man takes on a group of mercenaries the lead flies and he kicks butt It could have been called Rambo Goes to the Rockies it was that pat It did have one very effective scene right at the first of the film which had me cringing in horror Not a bad picture but just same ol same ol
This movie set out to be better than the average action movie and in that regard they succeeded This movie had spectacular cinematography featuring spectacular mountain snow and heights a very fit Stallone putting in a good performance as well an exciting plot and a great performance from it s main villain becouse he will really shock you with his evil ways The movie does not rank an all time great becouse of the weak screen play The plot and story cries for this movie to make Stallone an extra special human much like the Rambo or Rocky or Bond movie characters They chose to humanise Stallone s character in this one which is ok but considering the plot s style weakens the excitement factor Also the dialogue was cheesy and carelessly condescending at times The script should have been more realistic and less talky Another weak point was the unrealistic shooting scenes The movie makers should have been more carefull how they hadled the shooting hits and misses They should have continued the quality of the scenes of the shooting sequences during the plane hijacking early in the movie Instead they decided to water down a lot of the shooting sequences ala A Team TV series as soon as the villains set foot on the mountain tops This movie had a lot of all time great potential Crisper action sequences better dialogue and more Rambo Rocky style emotion determination from Stallone would have taken this movie to a higher level I know this was not Stallone s fault I sense the movie s director wanted to tone down Stallone s character and try to steal the movie by taking credit for his direction which was not all that great if not for his cinematographer Sill a good movie though
This movie is really nerve racking Cliffhangin movie Stallone was good as always Michael Rooker put on a surprising performance and John Lithgow play a excellent villain The music is fantastic especially the theme The movie is action packed and never dull If you are a Stallone fan then watch Cliffhanger you won t be disappointed
Cliffhanger is what appears to be Slyvester Stallone s last action movie before he became such an underrated actor It s about a mountain climber that must help his friend after being held hostage by mercenaries that want them to find three suitcases carrying money over 100 million dollars It has great action sequence s edge of your seat fun and a great time at the movies

After the success of Die Hard and it s sequels it s no surprise really that in the 1990s a glut of Die Hard on a movies cashed in on the wrong guy wrong place wrong time concept That is what they did with Cliffhanger Die Hard on a mountain just in time to rescue Sly Stop or My Mom Will Shoot Stallone s career br br Cliffhanger is one big nit pickers dream especially to those who are expert at mountain climbing base jumping aviation facial expressions acting skills All in all it s full of excuses to dismiss the film as one overblown pile of junk Stallone even managed to get out acted by a horse However if you an forget all the nonsense it s actually a very lovable and undeniably entertaining romp that delivers as plenty of thrills and unintentionally plenty of laughs br br You ve got to love John Lithgows sneery evilness his tick every box band of baddies and best of all the permanently harassed and hapless turncoat agent Rex Linn as Travers br br He may of been Henry in Portrait of a Serial Killer but Michael Rooker is noteworthy for a cringe worthy performance as Hal he insists on constantly shrieking in painful disbelief at his captors that man never hurt anybody And whilst he surely can t be it really does look like Ralph Waite s Frank character is grinning as the girl plummets to her death br br Mention too must go to former London s Burning actor Craig Fairbrass as the Brit bad guy who comes a cropper whilst using Hal as a Human Football yes you can t help enjoy that bit Hal needed a good kicking br br So forget your better judgement who cares if that could never happen lower your acting expectations turn up the volume and enjoy And if you re looking for Qaulen he s the one wearing the helicopter
FORGET CREDIBILITY br br You must not expect credibility with action movies where the superhero has to perform an endless string of unbelievable feats being trodden upon in the process but recovering at lightning speed and transforming innocuous gadgets in lethal weapons especially when Renny Harlin is directing br br CLIFFHANGER is no exception But the movie has numerous assets breathtaking scenery gorgeously photographed stunning special and visual effects the first five minutes are gripping and give the tone of the film excellent musical score welcome attempts at levity to relieve some of the tension and a solid cast two heroes Stallone star and cowriter has the lion s share of the footage but the excellent Michael Rooker more than stands his ground a charming heroin Janine Turner and one of the most darstardy bunch of villains ever priceless John Lithgow and deceivingly feminine Caroline Goodall but also Rex Linn in a longer than usual part and who makes the most of it Leon Craig Fairbrass Good solid entertainment then if no credibility As Roger Ebert wrote about another film It s the kind of movie you can sit back and enjoy as long as you don t make the mistake of thinking too much br br
The selection of Sylvester Stallone to perform the protagonist by Renny Harlin is commendable since Stallone is that sort of tough and craggy person who had earlier rendered the requisite audaciously versatile aura to the characters of Rocky Balbao and Rambo But to compare Die Hard series with Cliffhanger is a far fetched notion br br The excellently crafted opening scene introduces the audience to the thrill suspense and intrigue which is going to engulf them in the ensuing bloody and perilous encounter with the outlaws The heist and the high altitude transfer of hard cash in suit cases from one plane to the other is something not filmed before br br The biting cold of the snow capped Alps and the unfolding deceit and treachery among the antagonist forces makes one shiver with trepidation The forces of awesome adventure and ruthless murder kicks the drama through to the end br br Good movies are not made every year and people don t get a feast for eyes to watch every now and then Apart from the filthy language parlance which endows brazen excitement during certain scenes the movie can be regarded as one that is not going to fade its captivating appeal even watching it after so many years
This movie is just great It s entertaining from beginning to the end you re always gonna be at the edge of your seat throughout the entire movie In my opinion this movie is highly underrated by the critics br br Sly suits perfectly into the role of the well trained mountain rescue guy Gabe Walker Together with him Michael Rooker makes a great appearance as Hal Tucker And then John Lithgow one of the best performances I ve seen of him as a villain br br And the fact that 75 of the movie takes place at a mountain with a whole lot of bad guys on it makes way for a lot of action br br Brilliant movie
Cliffhanger is a decent action crime adventure with some flaws from director Renny Harlin whose admirable in making this movie about an expert climber who finds himself taken hostage with a fellow friend by a gang of dangerous criminals on the search for suit cases full of stolen cash in the Rocky Mountains Sylvester Stallone is impressive as Gabe Walker the expert climber especially in the action fight sequences but some of them definitely border on the line of unrealistic For the sake of the film though I willing to suspend my disbelief The rest of the cast including John Lithgow Michael Rooker Janine Turner Rex Linn Caroline Goodall and Leon are respectable as the supporting characters in the movie The action fight sequences are well executed but as mentioned before some aren t very realistic no matter how tough you are The climbing sequences however are very well done because instead of doing the whole film in a studio somewhere the locations they chose felt very real and the Ariel views of the mountain ranges are marvelous adding a touch of reality to the movie The deaths are inventive while others are sort of predictable The villains are solid but it would ve been better if they had focused on a more central one instead of having many of them The pacing of the movie was a little slow but the good outweighs the bad in this one If you re a big fan of Harlins or Stallone s than chances are you ll enjoy this one too Overall Cliffhanger has character development with enough action drama some suspense excitement thrills and good performances by the cast who make this movie worth the time to watch
Was this based on a comic book A video game A drawing by a 3 year old br br There is nothing in this movie to be taken seriously at all not the characters not the dialog not the plot not the action Nothing We have high tech international terrorists criminals who bicker like pre school kids Stallone s man of steel type resilience towards ice cold weather dialog so dumb that it s sometimes almost hilarious and so on Even the codename that the bad guys use is dumb tango tango A film that entertains through some suspense good action sequences and a nice snowy mountainous setting Oh yes and the unintentional humour br br The film opens with some truly bad and unconvincing gay banter between our go lucky and happy characters who are obviously having a swell time Then comes a sweat inducing failed rescue part which should make anyone with fear of heights problems want to pull their hair out And then we have some more bad dialog and after that some more great action This is the rhythm of the film in a nutshell br br Stallone s melodramatic exchange with Turner when they meet after a long time is so soapy so clich√©d so fake and so bad that it should force a chuckle out of any self respecting viewer Soon after this display of awful dialog writing we are witnesses to a spectacular and excellently shot hijack of an airplane The entire action is one big absurdity but it s mindless fun at its best Although the rest of the action is exciting and fun the airplane scenes are truly the highlight of the film After the landing our master criminals seek for a guide and end up with Stallone and Rooker They send Stallone to fetch the first case of money but somehow they do everything to make it as difficult as possible for him to reach it they take most of his clothes off so he can freeze and they won t give him the equipment he needs so he can fall off DO THESE GANGSTERS WANT THEIR MONEY FETCHED OR NOT Very silly Apparently they don t trust Stallone but surely they know that they can always black mail him by using Rooker as a hostage Nevertheless our gangsters make Stallone s climb difficult if for no logical reasons then to at least show us how truly evil they are lest there be any doubts And for those who might still doubt how evil the bad guys are they overact brag and snicker in a truly evil manner Everyone convinced Good You d better be Otherwise the writers will throw in a mass execution of twenty school children just to make sure that the evilness of the bad guys is crystal clear to everyone br br The old guy who flies the chopper How the hell did he fall for the trap Firstly he must have been warned by the MTV airhead about the criminals and secondly he must have heard Stallone s and Rooker s voices on the walkie talkies A whole bunch of idiotic verbal exchanges take place with Lithgow having the questionable honour of getting most of the silly lines Get off my back Lithgow I haven t even started climbing on your back Or Lithgow to Stallone We had a deal but now we only have each other And as for Lithgow s gang of murderers these guys never seem to want to kill immediately They are very creative about it they philosophize pretend that they are playing football with your body and so on br br Stallone co wrote this thing I have no idea what drugs he was on when he did it I d hate to think the script is this bad because of a low I Q
Since I first saw this in the theater it has been my favorite Since then I ve seen it countless times and I never get tired of it The setting has a lot to do with it the Colorado I know would be jealous but the storyline is original and I liked how it used small town mountain folk as the heroes There has not been a movie I can compare this too John Lithgow plays a smart villain but I love how he is completely out of his element he has to follow Tucker around and that s what keeps it interesting This is an action movie at it s BEST I don t think I ll see another that is so entertaining br br You don t need 50 000 rounds fired to qualify as an action movie It just has to keep you captivated not shell shocked
To be honest I didn t like that much this movie when I saw it for the first time But I guess the trouble is that I haven t seen it in a theater Big Mistake Because the 1 thing to see in Cliffhanger is the settings and 2 is the cinematography Try to see this movie on the largest TV possible and a great sound system The music is good and puts the movie to a higher level and a commercial potential The more I see it the more I like it br br It s definitely one of Renny Harlin s best movie THis guy knows about action Die Hard 2 The long kiss good bye etc And it s particularly good in this movie The special effect are great and spectacular Stallone really needed that movie get back with success Still good to see him
I m far from a Sylvester Stallone fan and I guess the only time I really appreciated his appearance was in the French movie Taxi 3 which is an almost inexistent small role And yet I must admit that this movie was actually not that bad even though I feared the worst br br When Gabe Stallone fails to rescue the girlfriend of one of his friends and she plunges to her death from a 4000 feet high mountain top he can t possibly force himself to keep working as a mountain ranger For almost a year he doesn t set a food in the reserve but than he returns Soon after he s back they get an emergency call from a group of hikers who got trapped in a snow storm At least that s what the rangers believe In reality it is a group of robbers who crashed with their airplane in the mountains after their daring plan to steal cases full of money from a flying government plane failed The cases are spread all over the reserve and they need the help of professional climbers to retrieve them br br This is of course not one of the most intelligent movies ever but in its genre it s an enjoyable one I especially enjoyed John Lithgow as the evil master mind and leader of the gang of robbers I know him best from the TV series 3rd Rock from the Sun but I enjoyed his performance in this movie as well Overall the acting is OK it had a lot of action to offer and of course also some one liners but it also offered a very nice decor This movie was filmed in a magnificent natural environment I loved the snowy mountains and valleys the mountain rivers and the forests Perhaps that s why I give this movie a score higher than what I normally give to an action adventure movie of this kind I give it a 6 5 10 If you don t expect too much this is an enjoyable movie
Watching Cliffhanger makes me nostalgic for the early 90s a time when virtually every new action movie could be described as Die Hard in a on a Cliffhanger is Die Hard on a mountain and pretty good for what it is br br But unlike Passenger 57 and Under Siege which are decent Die Hard clones on their own terms Cliffhanger dispenses with the enclosed feeling of many action movies and embraces breathtaking landscapes that in their immensity threaten to overwhelm and trivialize the conflicts of the people fighting and dying among the peaks br br Years before other movies like A Simple Plan and Fargo dramatized crime and murder on snowbound locations Cliffhanger director Renny Harlin recognized the visual impact of juxtaposing brutal violence and grim struggles to survive against cold and indifferent natural surroundings br br The opening sequence has already received substantial praise all of which it deserves its intensity allows us to forget the artifice of the camera and the actors and simply believe that what we are seeing is actually happening Not even Harlin s shot of the falling stuffed animal which is powerfully effective but still threatens to become too much of a joke and which he repeated in Deep Blue Sea or the ridiculous expression on Ralph Waite s face can dim the sequence s power br br The next impressive set piece is the gunfight and heist aboard the jet As written by Stallone and Michael France and directed by Harlin the audience is plunged into the action by not initially knowing which agents are involved in the theft and which are not the bloody double crosses are completely unexpected As Roger Ebert has observed the stuntman who made the mid air transfer between the planes deserves some special recognition br br Later during the avalanche sequence one of the terrorists thieves appears to be actually falling as the wall of snow carries him down the mountain So far as I know no one was killed in the making of this movie a small miracle considering the extreme nature of some of the stunts so obviously a dummy was used for the shot But the shot itself remains impressive because we re left wondering how Harlin or more likely one of the second unit directors knew exactly where to place the camera br br I ll take Sly Stallone as my action hero any day of the week because he s one of the few movie stars I ve ever seen who s completely convincing as someone who can withstand a lot of physical and emotional pain and at the same time actually feels that pain The role of Gabe Walker really complements Stallone s acting strengths he plays an older more vulnerable kind of action hero giving an impressively low key performance as a mountain rescuer who must redeem himself br br In contrast to many of today s post Matrix comic book inspired action heroes Stallone s Walker is an ordinary man who becomes a hero without any paranormal or computer enhanced abilities In Cliffhanger the hero almost freezes to death and his clothes start to show big tears as he barely escapes one dangerous situation after another He winces when he s hit and bleeds when he s cut particularly in the cavern sequence when he takes a Rocky style pummeling from one of the mad dog villains br br It should be noted that the utterly despicable villains really contribute to the movie s effectiveness when I first saw this movie as a teenager I was rooting for the good guys every step of the way and anticipating when another bad guy would bite the dust or rather the ice at one point I actually cheered as one of the most cold blooded characters in the movie deservedly suffered a violent demise br br Lithgow s British accent is as unconvincing as the movie s occasional model plane or model helicopter but he s fundamentally a good actor and one of the few who can perfectly recite silly dialogue in one scene looking at his hostages Stallone and Rooker trying to decide which tasks to give them he actually says You stay You fetch Even a better actor such as Anthony Hopkins might have had trouble with that line br br Even if Cliffhanger occasionally tosses credibility aside it does so only for the sake of a more entertaining show br br Early in the movie for example Lithgow openly says to one of his men Retire Stallone when he comes down No real criminal mastermind would have made this mistake even unconsciously his carelessness allows Rooker to shout a warning up to Sly on the rock face and this precipitates a gripping tug of war between Stallone and the bad guys trying to pull him down by the rope tied to his leg br br Lithgow could have given his order by a more subtle means but the sequence might not have been as much fun to watch if it hadn t given Rooker an opportunity to openly defy the arrogance of his captor br br Done very much in the style of a Saturday matinee serial or at times a Western Cliffhanger is built on such a solid foundation that it survives some weak elements that would have undermined a lesser film br br Besides the painfully obvious aircraft models mentioned before the weak moments include a couple of scenes shot on cheap indoor sets with REALLY fake snow as well as two other scenes involving bats and wolves that seem unnecessary in an already action packed narrative Finally Harlin s decision to film some of the death scenes in slow motion seems pointless since the technique contributes nothing to the scenes br br It s a shame that Stallone is now too old for action movies because his character in this movie seems so credible that inevitably I wonder what he would be like years later But perhaps it s best that Cliffhanger stands on its own for all time without a sequel there are enough tired and obsolete movie franchises already There was an unofficial sequel that called itself Vertical Limit compared to that clinker Cliffhanger belongs on the IMDb s Top 250 list br br Rating 8 Very good especially considering most of Stallone s other movies
Sly s best out and out action film It is a superbly enjoyable movie with some interesting characters solid performances and Renny Harlins direction is stylishly assured Stallone is rarely this interesting in his action films and he certainly looks the part in terms of the action scenes This was one of the best action films of the year and one of the most thrilling and enjoyable of the 90 s a definite genre classic As a Stallone fan this is one I look back on with fond memories Plenty of superb action and Sly in prime action man form Action lovers appreciate this film because it has all the hallmarks that make a good aciton film The film looks great and there is great support from Janine Turner Michael Rooker and John Lithgow
Wracked with guilt after a lot of things felt apart on that ledge an ace mountain rescue climber Gabriel Walker Stallone comes back for his girlfriend Jessie Janine Turner while over the cloudy skies where the weather looks a bit threatening a spectacularly precarious mid air hijacking goes wrong and 100 million taken from a Treasury Department plane get lost in the middle of nowhere followed by a crash landing br br Stranded off the snowy peaks and needing mountain guides to win back the stolen cash the high trained hikers make an emergency call asking the help of a rescue unit br br Unfortunately Gab and Hall Michael Rooker have to team up to arrive at the scene of the crash unaware that the distress call was a fake and a bunch of merciless terrorists led by a psychotic John Lithgow are waiting for them only to find out a way off the stormy mountain with the dumped cases of money br br With breathtaking shots vertiginous scenery dizzying heights perilous climbs freezing temperatures Cliffhanger is definitely Stallone s best action adventure movie
I don t think I ll ever understand the hate for Renny Harlin Die Hard 2 was cool and he gave the world Cliffhanger one of the most awesome action movies ever That s right you little punks Cliffhanger rules and we all know it br br Sly plays Gabe Walker a former rescue climber who is just visiting his old town when he is asked to help a former friend Hal Tucker Michael Rooker assist in a rescue on a mountain peak Walker obviously came back at a convenient time because the stranded people are actually a sophisticated team of thieves led by Eric Qualen John Lithgow Qualen co have lost a whole lot of money they stole from the U S government somewhere in the Rocky Mountains and they really would like it back br br Essentially Cliffhanger is another Die Hard clone Just trade in the confines of Nakatomi Plaza to the open mountain ranges of the Rocky Mountains complete with scenes created to point out the weaknesses of our hero and keep him mortal Naturally that set up is totally ripped to shreds soon enough as Stallone s character avoids quite a large number of bullets with ease and slams face first into several rock faces with no apparent side effects After all isn t that what action movies are all about br br Cliffhanger is one of the most exciting action movies around A showcase of great scenes and stunts One of the early stunts is one of the best stunts I ve ever seen in a movie and while the rest of the movie does not get any better than it did at the beginning it maintains its action awesomeness John Lithgow s lead villain is entertaining and one bad dude Quite possibly one of the coolest lead villains ever br br Cliffhanger is easily one of Stallone s best efforts definitely Renny Harlin s best effort and a very exciting action movie 9 10
Eric Valette is obviously a talented film maker and so are the two guys who wrote the script Therefore Mal√©fique is a great flick made with just a few bucks but also tons of imagination Well I m a bit exaggerating but nevertheless I m sincere So if you like dark gory movies go and see this one It s really worth it
Four prisoners share a single cell the domineering transvestite Marcus Clovis Cornillac Marcus s idiot savant buddy Paquerette Dimitri Rataud who will eat anything in sight including pocket watches cockroaches and his little sister Lassalle Philippe Laudenbach the intelligent librarian who murdered his wife and Carr√®re G√©rald Laroche the new guy who was caught up in corporate fraud and is now focused on escaping After a brick falls from the wall of the cell the men discover the hidden journal written by a Fountain of Youth obsessed serial killer who occupied the cell in the 1920s Is this journal the secret to their escape Or is there something much more sinister behind it br br I was a little weary about getting into this film because the only other experience I have with Eric Valette was the dreadful One Missed Call 2008 which I consider to be the worst theatrically released film I ve ever seen However much of what was wrong with One Missed Call could probably be attributed to Klavan s awful script because as I remember Valette s direction wasn t the worst part about the film unless he chose to include the baby Anyway Mal√©fique was a good way to get my respect back it s a French film obviously something I like and it takes place in prison which is my second favourite horror setting after asylums So that s two points for him before the film even starts Luckily Valette had me once the film ended as well Mal√©fique is a rather deep rather complex rather compelling story of obsession and desperation the desire and need to bring fantasies to reality While it s not a terrifying film in the traditional sense the oddity of its power makes it pretty damn frightening The period between the climax and conclusion was some of the best film I ve seen in quite some time and I would wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a decent psychological thriller with some pretty cool gore br br Final verdict 8 5 10 Quite a bit of respect earned back by Valette br br Note Paramount picked up the rights to make an American remake surprise surprise It s due out in 2009 I m not sure why to be honest as this doesn t seem like something that would be a big moneymaker here in the states But I ve been surprised before br br Vive La France br br AP3
A prison cell Four prisoners Carrere a young company director accused of fraud 35 year old transsexual in the process of his transformation Daisy a 20 year old mentally challenged idiot savant and Lassalle a 60 year old intellectual who murdered his wife Behind a stone slab in the cell mysteriously pulled loose they discovered a book the diary of a former prisoner Danvers who occupied the cell at the beginning of the century The diary contains magic formulas that supposedly enable prisoners to escape Malefique is one of the creepiest and most intelligent horror films I have seen this year The film has a grimy shadowy feel influenced by the works of H P Lovecraft which makes for a very creepy and unsettling atmosphere There is a fair amount of gore involved with some imaginative and brutal death scenes and the characters of four prisoners are surprisingly well developed It s a shame that Eric Valette made truly horrible remake of One Missed Call after his stunning debut 9 out of 10
Now I know French inmates are unlikely to have read Lovecraft and that proves my point that his writings should be taught in school maybe as a separate subject but how did they think something that sounds like ftagn yog sototh could possibly lead to any good br br The movie takes place in a prison where four very unlikely cell mates stumble upon a magical book that may if read right get them out As prisons go the cell was totally unrealistic so that made it hard for me to get into the atmosphere of things It also moves rather slowly which may bore people But other than that this is top notch horror feeling mixing Sartre s hell is other people with a Lovecraft Barker type of story and doing rather successfully br br Bottom line take the time to watch this That means not doing it when you are about to go to work or to sleep or while doing something else This is a movie that works best if you are immersed into it Lessons to be learned Yog is bad almost as bad as French women
I was hooked from beginning to end Great horror comes from disturbing imagery and organic shocks that are created not to make you jump but to make you go What the f ck did I just see All the other commentators gave short summaries of what the film is about so I won t rehash what has already been said I was telling other people about this movie days after I had seen it just because it still haunted me I even had a bad dream after seeing it and I am a true horror fan not easily spooked by tripe like The Grudge or even Silent Hill What gave me the bad dreams was the unease I felt about what I would do if I were in that cell with those guys What would my personal horror be my subconscious took me there and it was not pleasant That my friends is what a good horror flick does to you The best part of this movie is that it is subtle It s not about Bogeymen that jump out at you alien invasions or tons of gore It s the opposite The horror you create in your own mind The irony for the four characters is that the horror comes not from an external force that asserts it s power over them Simply the men ask for the one thing they desire and they get it but not in the way they imagined So on the one hand they get what they wish for from an occult book but may ultimately wish they hadn t Sometimes being locked in a jail cell is the best place to be
Now this is what I d call a good horror With occult supernatural undertones this nice low budget French movie caught my attention from the very first scene This proves you don t need wild FX or lots of gore to make an effective horror movie br br The plot revolves around 4 cellmates in a prison and each of these characters and their motives become gradually more interesting as the movie builds up tension to the finale Most of the action we see through the eyes of Carrere who has just entered prison and has to get used to living with these 3 other inmates br br I won t say much because this movie really deserves to be more widely seen There a few flaws though the FX are not that good but they re used effectively the plot leaves some mysteries open and things get very confusing towards the end but Malefique redeems itself by the time it s over br br I thought his was a very good movie 8 10
Watched this French horror film last night and pretty much liked it The whole movie takes place in a prison cell with basically three prisoners who find a hand written journal in a wall from a serial killer that had escaped the prison 20 years earlier somehow without leaving his cell As they look through the diary they discover it delves into the black arts and commands that might be their way out of the cell and to freedom What they find out is something completely different and horrifying to say the least I like low budget horror films that deliver the goods in a fairly quality way and tell a good story This movie does just that despite taking a while to get going The result and the horror they unleash is very interesting to me and I enjoyed the ride Not a lot of gore but that wouldn t fit the story although the gore it has is pretty good
This film centers on four criminals locked away in a prison who desire escape from their cell hoping that a mysterious book of black magic penned by a former inmate around 1920 named Danvers who wanted to use spells to keep his skin young br br Carr√®re s G√©rald Laroche criminal business tactics shortcuts have landed him in prison with three oddball cell mates a transsexual brute Marcus Clovis Cornillac Marcus love toy P√¢querette Dimitri Rataud who eats objects he touches and is in prison for eating his six month old sister and obeys his charge as if he were his mother and the scholarly Lassalle Philippe Laudenbach who doesn t read or eat breakfast the latter being that he murdered his wife during that time of the day The film follows Carr√®re as he reads from the book attempting to understand it s meanings hoping to find an exit from his prison Carr√®re loves his child and for a while believes his wife will get him out early on bail When she betrays him Carr√®re begins to slowly seethe with hate and longing to see and hold his beloved son Carr√®re s toughest critic is Marcus who longs to be fully female while still folding to several masculine traits such as working out and taking a leak standing up He talks tough and uses his muscle as a type of fear tactic although deep inside is a world of vulnerability P√¢querette is completely under Marcus control and behaves like a canine to it s master there s even an alarming scene where P√¢querette breast feeds from Marcus Lassalle is an unraveling mystery opening up for us to slowly understand his ulterior motives and what lies within his possibly sinister brain Clearly intellectual and holding possible secrets from the others Lassalle is actually the one who keeps the motivation of pursuing the secrets of the book going Soon those who aren t a threat to the book seek their true escape not as much from the cell of four walls but the cell that imprisons their true desires After a certain murder the book is thrown from the room with a very fascinating character entering the film with a camcorder as if he were a new occupant who is this person and how does he understand the power of a book tosses away and better yet how to use it A constant in this film is each of the prisoners often seen throughout looking out their window into the world just out of reach br br I m glad I had a chance to watch this film It does play out like Monkey s Paw the characters get what they desire but a price must be met There s gore in the film startling moments of graphic violence but in my opinion this is first and foremost a story driven tale The gore is a product of what the book unleashes One of the group gets his limbs twisted while suspended in the air while a grisly opening act displays the carnage left in the wake of one man s desire We see Danver s fate at the end with a magnificent special effects sequence regarding an infant melting away Lassalle s fate is a masterful effects sequence I will say that Mal√©fique through Eric Valette s well paced direction always kept my attention and for being such an isolated movie about 95 of the film takes place in a singular location the prison cell it never seems to drag I guess that s a testament to interesting actors and fascinating characterizations not to mention a compelling story using the supernatural to drive them
In a penitentiary four prisoners occupy a cell Carr√®re G√©rald Laroche who used his company to commit a fraud and was betrayed by his wife the drag Lassalle Philippe Laudenbach and his prot√©g√©e the retarded P√¢querette Dimitri Rataud who ate his six months sister and the intellectual Marcus Clovis Cornillac who killed his wife One night Carr√®re finds an ancient journal hidden in a hole in the wall of the cell They realize that the book was written by Danvers Geoffrey Carey in the beginning of the last century and is about black magic They decide to read and use its content to escape from the prison when they find the truth about Danvers fate Mal√©fique is an original intriguing and claustrophobic French low budget horror movie The story is practically in the same location does not have any clich√©s and hooks the attention of the viewer until the last scene I am a great fan of French cinema usually romances dramas and police stories but I noted that recently I have seen some good French horror movies such as Un Jeu d Enfants Belphegor and Dead End My vote is seven br br Title Brazil Sinais do Mal Signs of the Evil
Malefique pretty much has the viewer from start to finish with its edgy atmosphere Nearly the whole movie is set in a prison cell revolving around 4 characters of which transvestite Marcus and his little retarded boy are way out the strangest Soon the inmates find a diary of a previous inmate behind a brick which deals with his obsession of occult and black magic themes leading to his escape from the cell From here on everything deals with uncovering the secret of the book and its spells to flee from prison That leads to some accidents on the way out of the cell into the unknown light br br Honestly I think the story is rather poor and the final twist is nice but to me the ends are pretty loosely tied together Anyway I was thrilled until the last moment because the atmosphere of the movie is unique with minimal setting and cast The kills are raw and eerie its doesn t take gore to chill your spine and the occult themes are also done very well and reminded me of the hell themes in Hellraiser Malefique has a claustrophobic and cold dirty feel with greenish tint At times you wonder if the real or the occult world depicted here is stranger when the retarded boy looses his fingers and is lulled to sleep sucking on Marcus breasts it seems normal so how strange can glowing gates to freedom be With its budget the movie creates a unique atmosphere and chills the viewer in a very different way than most of the genre shockers do I just wish the story had led to a more consistent finale Several elements like the visitor with the camera the other inmates obsession with books and the toy doll vaguely pointing to the end don t fit tight in the story Anyway I ll keep my eyes open for other movies from director Valette although its a turn off to see he s is doing a Hollywood remake of One missed call which was worn off and useless already in the Miike version
Good horror movies from France are quite rare and it s fairly easy to see why Whenever a talented young filmmaker releases a staggering new film he emigrates towards glorious Hollywood immediately after to directed the big budgeted remake of another great film classic How can France possibly build up a solid horror reputation when their prodigy directors leave the country after just one film Haute Tension was a fantastic movie and it earned director Alexandre Aja a one way ticket to the States to remake The Hills Have Eyes which he did terrifically I may add Eric Valette s long feature debut Mal√©fique was a very promising and engaging horror picture too and he s already off to the Hollywood as well to direct the remake of Takashi Miike s ghost story hit One Missed Call So there you have it two very gifted Frenchmen that aren t likely to make any more film in their native country some time soon Mal√©fique is a simple but efficient chiller that requires some patience due to its slow start but once the plot properly develops it offers great atmospheric tension and a handful of marvelous special effects The film almost entirely takes place in one single location and only introduces four characters We re inside a ramshackle French prison cell with four occupants The new arrival is a businessman sentenced to do time for fraud the elderly and wise inmate sadistically killed his wife and then there s a crazy transvestite and a mentally handicapped boy to complete the odd foursome They find an ancient journal inside the wall of their cell belonging to a sick murderer in the 1920 s who specialized in black magic rites and supernatural ways to escape The four inmates begin to prepare their own escaping plan using the bizarre formulas of the book only to realize the occult is something you shouldn t mess with Eric Valette dedicates oceans of time to the character drawings of the four protagonists which occasionally results in redundant and tedious sub plots but his reasons for this all become clear in the gruesome climax when the book suddenly turns out to be some type of Wishmaster device Mal√©fique is a dark film with truckloads of claustrophobic tension and several twisted details about human behavior Watch it before some wealthy American production company decides to remake it with four handsome teenage actors in the unconvincing roles of hardcore criminals
French horror cinema has seen something of a revival over the last couple of years with great films such as Inside and Switchblade Romance bursting on to the scene Mal√©fique preceded the revival just slightly but stands head and shoulders over most modern horror titles and is surely one of the best French horror films ever made Mal√©fique was obviously shot on a low budget but this is made up for in far more ways than one by the originality of the film and this in turn is complimented by the excellent writing and acting that ensure the film is a winner The plot focuses on two main ideas prison and black magic The central character is a man named Carr√®re sent to prison for fraud He is put in a cell with three others the quietly insane Lassalle body building transvestite Marcus and his retarded boyfriend Daisy After a short while in the cell together they stumble upon a hiding place in the wall that contains an old journal After translating part of it they soon realise its magical powers and realise they may be able to use it to break through the prison walls br br Black Magic is a very interesting topic and I m actually quite surprised that there aren t more films based on it as there s so much scope for things to do with it It s fair to say that Mal√©fique makes the best of it s assets as despite it s restraints the film never actually feels restrained and manages to flow well throughout Director Eric Valette provides a great atmosphere for the film the fact that most of it takes place inside the central prison cell ensures that the film feels very claustrophobic and this immensely benefits the central idea of the prisoners wanting to use magic to break out of the cell it s very easy to get behind them It s often said that the unknown is the thing that really frightens people and this film proves that as the director ensures that we can never really be sure of exactly what is round the corner and this helps to ensure that Mal√©fique actually does manage to be quite frightening The film is memorable for a lot of reasons outside the central plot the characters are all very interesting in their own way and the fact that the book itself almost takes on its own character is very well done Anyone worried that the film won t deliver by the end won t be disappointed either as the ending both makes sense and manages to be quite horrifying Overall Mal√©fique is a truly great horror film and one of the best of the decade HIGHLY recommended viewing
Mal√©fique is a very interesting movie It is an unholy alloy of triumphs and failures The central concept is great three inmates with bizarre personalities are joined by a fourth who the audience identify with and they try to escape from their cell using a book of magic that they find within the walls of the cell br br The atmosphere is well woven it reminds me of reading about the prison stay of Edmond Dantes in the Ch√¢teau d If prior to becoming the Count of Monte Cristo The director sets up the feeling that the characters are tied to the cell particularly the character we are meant to identify with Carr√®re a white collar criminal whose crime is not specified but it s obliquely suggested might be fraud On one occasion Carr√®re dithers when leaving the cell for exercise and has the cell door shut on him we never leave the cell the claustrophobia is unbroken There are also no shots of the prison outside the cell and the view through the bars is a longing sunset over a generic prison wall So even though the film appears to be very modern it has a very old world feel of incarceration br br The characters are intriguing We have Marcus a violent pre op transsexual who plays an abusive mother to P√¢querette French for Daisy a heavily retarded young man P√¢querette likes to eat everything he finds beautiful and unfortunately this included his baby sister hence his current predicament I like this comment on internalisation very primitive Lasalle is a withdrawn possessed elderly man in for brutally murdering his wife br br The central message of the movie is that your desires will annihilate you and there s a ritual that goes with that I think that s what disturbs me the most seeing people destroying themselves ritualistically It has a real life ring to it The quite simple soundtrack backs this up well every step deeper into the quicksand is accompanied by the dull ringing of a gong I m actually hearing the gong now every time I do something self destructive br br I think one of the plot problems is that the ends of the characters don t really reinforce the message consistently particularly with Carr√®re also the concept of the book seems to alter throughout the film not in terms of a successive revelation either I also think that some of the images we see are a bit amateurish more by design than execution such as the famous vagina eye and the sodomy of Lasalle for me totally hollow images br br At the end the movie it feels like the director is in a rush to get it over with and some things don t seem logical for example we ve been clumsily led to believe different things about Carr√®re s child This doesn t change the fact though that what we have here is that rare bird a pure horror movie There is no comedic dross or genre segueing like Cube 1997 Natali the obvious movie to compare it to it s a total immersion experience where you feel as if you are in the cell with the characters This last comment I make about it being a pure experience I think is something others have mentioned as well so that is a fairly unanimous point br br On a personal note my favourite part of the film is when Lasalle talks about his past as a librarian He very vividly describes a scene where he goes to work one day and sits down in his usual place in the centre of a room where all the books are arranged in a circle around him The books seem to be chanting to him that he will never contain their knowledge This prompts Lasalle to go insane That really is the problem with an obsession with understanding and knowledge It s something I myself have felt br br One final comment is that two of the quite well received comments on the board have confused the characters names To convince yourself that Lasalle is the older librarian character simply click on Philippe Laudenbach s page and you will see he was born in 1936
I d waited for some years before this movie finally got released in England but was in many ways very pleased when I finally saw it There are a lot of great things to the film for a start the acting Its not something I have all that much need for in a horror picture but the people in this film all put in fine work This and the constantly gripping and interesting script with a nice sorta Lovecraftian feel to it give the film a real solid backbone Add to this the doses of surreal nightmare imagery and occasional gruesome gore and the films a winner It has my favorite kind of gore too supernatural and splattery Also the characters of Marcus the angry bodybuilding transsexual and Daisy his mentally retarded lover plaything are genuinely freakish and unnerving at times and give a far out anything goes sense of morbid grown up craziness which works well with the frequent Freudian overtones This is one of the most impressive recent horror movies far more shocking or out there than anything Hollywood can produce My only gripe was that I wanted the ending to be darker in tone but it still works so on the whole I d really recommend this to serious horror buffs
I didn t feel that this film was quite as clever as it seemed to think it was but enjoyed it nevertheless br br It is original although reminded me a little of two other French films Vidocq and City of Lost Children mostly for the colouring but also for the edgy quality of the close ups of the characters br br Set in a prison cell but do not let this put you off this film seemingly goes further than many a multi locationed blockbuster br br Always interesting with the perennial Black Arts well to the fore and very good characterisation making some only too believable br br Scary with some gore this is well worth a viewing
If you re one of those who recognise with pleasure such arcane titles as Book of the Dead Book of Eibon or Necronomicon then you should feel right at home with Malefique a film which also features an occult tome one with the power to change the destinies of all involved Discovered by four French prisoners sharing a cell the fearsome object has been placed in the wall there by Danvers a serial killer incarcerated back in the 1920s a man obsessed with rejuvenation and the black arts before he abruptly vanished Finders of the book are Carr√®re G√©rald Laroche a company embezzler shopped by his wife Lassalle Philippe Laudenbach who aspires to be a woman but at the same time body builds to execute an escape plan the halfwit P√¢querette Dimitri Rataud who once ate his baby sister and the librarian Marcus Clovis Cornillac supposedly driven mad by reading who murdered his wife Reminding the viewer of Meat Loaf s equally bizarre bosomy male in Fight Club 1999 Lassalle begins as the dominant member of the quartet one who is especially protective of the infantile P√¢querette With the coming of the book however and the overarching need to decipher its dangerous contents Marcus assumes greater and greater significance At first assured of an early bail meanwhile Carr√®re takes little more than academic interest in events Suddenly he too needs an urgent escape option and as the prisoners experiment Danvers book starts to reveal some of its terrifying powers br br Staged for the most part within a prison cell and between four or five characters Malefique has a claustrophobic air entirely suited to its subject matter as well as the limited budget of the filmmakers Only at the start and then at the conclusion do we get to leave the confines of the cell a necessary opening out which only serves to emphasise the doomed closed in nature of proceedings elsewhere More than anything this is a film about being trapped either as a victim of your criminal past or of occult events now unfolding I m going to escape says Carr√®re at the start of the film wishing more than anything to be able to rejoin his wife and son Whether or not he does it will be at a terrible price and the great irony of the film is that the ultimate form of an escape may not be one a man might imagine br br With all its budget limitations it is greatly to the first time feature director Eric Vallette s credit that his film succeeds as well as it does As critics have noticed it is a film with strong Freudian overtones Lassalle s distinctive mammaries and adult breast feeding for instance the picture of a vagina which comes to life and develops an eye the grown man who dissolves back into a foetus Danvers original placenta fetish the dark cell as a primitive womb from which delivery is awaited etc With so many interesting aspects to the script Vallette hardly puts a foot wrong and he succeeds in creating a genuinely unsettling atmosphere out of what when one comes down to it is just a matter of four guys four bunks one folding table and a book There s a genuine growing Lovecraftian frisson as the men summon up the unnameable darkness from within its pages while one or two moments the aforementioned blinking vagina or what ultimately happens to P√¢querette are unsettlingly memorable The pacing of many of the dark events in Malefique is deliberate rejecting the rapid cutting of many Hollywood productions a video culture approach that often subverts the horrified gaze in favour of quick fix action and gore Perhaps this is a particularly European manner as one recalls a similar measured approach to shocking hallucination taken in such films as Verhoeven s The Fourth Man 1983 a film that incidentally also shares a particularly nasty image based around a prolapsed eye br br Lensed well in 1 85 1 Malefique benefits from excellent performances and if for this viewer at least the conclusion was not as explainable as it might have been the journey to the final shot was worth taking Coming so soon after the release of the similarly well received Haute Tension aka Switchblade Romance 2003 this is another reason to be grateful that good horror films are once again emerging from the French industry this after a time when it seemed the only worthwhile product came from Asia
Well magic works in mysterious ways This movie about 4 prisoners trying to escape with the help of spells written by another prisoner centuries ago was a superb occult thriller with a surprising end and lots of suspense Even if it had something of a theater play almost everything happens in the cell it never got boring and it was acted very well In the tradition of Cube you felt trapped with the Characters and even if they were criminal you developed some sympathy with some of them only to change your mind by the twists the story takes Some happenings catched you off guard and there was always a touch of insanity in the air Altogether intense and entertaining and as I didn t expect anything a friend rented it it was a positive surprise
Mal√©fique is an example of how a horror film can be effective with nothing more than a well executed plot and a lot of heart Its cast doesn t have recognized names it doesn t have a big budget and it certainly lacks in the visual effects aspect but it compensates all that with an intelligent and well written script an effective cast and the vision of a director focused more on telling the story than in delivering cheap thrills Eric Valette may not be a well know name yet but with Mal√©fique his feature length debut he proves he is at the level of contemporaries like Jeunet Gans or Aja br br The film is the story of four prisoners in a cell four different men with very different backgrounds but with one single goal to get out Carr√®re G√©rald Laroche gets imprisoned after being declared guilty of a multi millionaire fraud his cell mates the violent Marcus Clovis Cornillac the intellectual Lassalle Philippe Laudenbach and the mentally challenged P√¢querette Dimitri Rataud are all convicted for murder and give Carr√®re a cold welcome Their personalities will clash as Carr√®re discovers an ancient book detailing how a former prisoner escaped using black magic br br Written by Alexandre Charlo and Franck Magnier Mal√©fique is a great mix of dark fantasy and horror in a way very reminiscent of Clive Barker s stories The movie s strongest point is the way it builds up the characters they are all have very complex and different personalities and a lot of the tension and suspense comes from their constant clash of personalities The story s supernatural element is very well handled and overall gives the film the feeling of reading a Gothic novel Despite being a movie about four men locked in a room the movie never gets boring or tiresome and in fact the isolation of the group increases the feeling of distrust claustrophobia and specially paranoia br br Director Eric Valette makes a great use of atmosphere mood and his cast to give life to the plot Despite its obvious lack of budget he has crafted a brilliant film that feels original fresh and very attractive His subtle and effective camera work helps to make the film dynamic despite its single location and the slow pace the film unfolds is excellent to create the heavy atmosphere of isolation and distrust the movie bases its plot The very few displays of special effects are very well done and Valette trades quantity for quality in the few but terrific scenes of gore br br The characters are what make this film work and the cast definitely deserves some of the credit G√©rald Laroche is excellent as Carr√®re a man at first sight innocent but who hides a dark past Philippe Laudenbach and Dimitri Rataud are very effective too specially Rataud in his very demanding role However is Clovis Cornillac who steal the show with his performance as Marcus a violent and disturbed man who deep inside only wants to be himself The characters are superbly developed and the cast makes the most of them br br The movie is terrific but it is not without its share of flaws Of course the most notorious one is its the low budget Some of the CGI effects are a bit poor compared to the effective make up and prosthetics used in other scenes however it is never too bad for it Probably the bad thing about Mal√©fique is that it seems to lose some steam by the end when it focuses on the supernatural black magic rather than in the characters not too much of a bad thing but the ending may seem weak from that point of view br br Anyways Mal√©fique is another one of those great horror films coming out from France lately and one that deserves to have more recognition Valette is definitely a talent to follow as this modest albeit complex tale of the supernatural is prove enough of his abilities Personally this film is a new favorite 8 10
When I was six yo I learned about a series called Los Campeones and even if I was just a kid I did everything I need to convince my parents to let me watch The Champions and the Avengers once every week I think that was the Golden Age of English series I already own the complete cycle of The Prisoner but lasted also a few years later with The Tomorrow People the Worst Witch I just me or this is Harry Potter in girl of course before As much as I want The Campions to be in Zone 1 or Zone 4 I m also waiting for Dr Who pack the whole series in a set of uhm maybe 300 DVD s please I couldn t expend more for it 8 People of Tomorrow and several other low budget but great stories to be available within my reached zones I speak and understand English but not all my relatives do including my parents whom introduced me into these great stories I hope someday someone could feel the attraction of these series and then could sell them as I originally view them Dubbed or subtitled but in the same format I saw them Remember Zone 1 or 4 are OK with my TV set
I wasn t born until 4 years after this wonderful show first aired but luckily I managed to catch the reruns of the mid 90 s and the rest is history I was hooked The premise was pretty simple two hardened Nemesis agents Richard Barrett and Craig Stirling William Gaunt and Stuart Damon are partnered up with an expert if not young Doctor and Biologist Sharron Macready to head behind the bamboo curtain to retrieve a dangerous biological agent from being used by red china Whilst making their escape their plane is hit by machine gun fire and they crash in the heart of the Himalayas where their lives are saved by a mysterious and previously undiscovered civilisation who heal and enhance the senses of the trio thus setting the scene for many exciting adventures to come br br The series lasted for 30 hour long episodes and I guess it was its relatively short lived one season run that has set it up for cult status br br Monty Berman the producer was notorious for making things as cheaply as possible and sometimes the show suffered for this with incredibly tacky sets particularly in Episodes such as Happening a studio deputising for the Australian outback and the snow sets of Operation Deep Freeze and The Beginning but if you can get past this and focus on the characters and the story lines the show was really a lot of fun It had a great mix of adventure and plenty of deadpan humour mainly from some terrific one liners from William Gaunt br br The chemistry from the three leads was fantastic you get the sense that they were really having a lot of fun making the show and this is borne out in the 2005 reunion documentary where the three reunite after over 35 years to reminisce about the show and laugh about Anthony Nicholls awful wig They all shared equal screen time and all had their moments to shine I have to say I was always a Richard Barrett fan I loved his sardonic humour along with that dangerous edge he was certainly a man you didn t cross and those eyes the bluest eyes you would probably see on TV I have also followed Bill Gaunts career with interest since However Craig Stirling certainly would have had his legion of female fans and I am sure Alexandra Bastedo had a whole queue of male fans swooning over her too br br The show also had a plethora of guest stars to entice with including Donald Sutherland Jeremy Brett Peter Wyngarde Burt Kwouk Anton Rodgers Kate O Mara Jenny Linden Paul Eddington and Colin Blakely br br Notable episodes for me were Auto Kill The Interrogation The Fanatics The Mission and The Gilded Cage but I am sure every one has their personal favourites br br If you do get a chance to watch this show for the first time or to re watch it after many years remember to watch it in the context of the time it was made and just sit back and enjoy the characters and the chemistry from the three leads is what made this wonderful show for me and I don t think I will ever tire of it br br Enjoy
My siblings and I stumbled upon The Champions when our local station aired re runs of it one summer in the 1970 s We absolutely adored it There was something so exotic and mysterious about it especially when compared to the usual American re runs Petticoat Junction Green Acres you get the idea It had a similar feel to The Avengers not too much of a surprise since it was also British and in the spy adventure genre br br I would love to see it again now hopefully it holds up I ve mentioned this show to others and no one has ever heard of it so I began to wonder if I d imagined its whole existence But the wonder that is the web has allowed me track down information about it Hopefully it will find a new generation of fans
Well What can I say other than these people are Super in every way I quite like Sharon Mcreedy I enjoy this pure Nostalgic Series And I have the boxed set of 9 discs 30 episodes I did not realise that they had made so many I also think that it is a great shame that they have not made any more I wish that I got given these powers Imagine me being knocked off my cycle somewhere and being knocked out cold then waking up in a special hospital Later on I discover that my body has been enhanced Just like Richard Barrat These stories are 50 Minutes of pure action and suspense all the way You cannot fight these 3 people as they would defeat you in all forms of weaponry The music is well written and to me puts a wonderful picture of 3 super beings in my mind The sort of powers that the champions have are the same as our domestic dog or cats Improved sight Improved hearing and touch and the strength of 10 men for Richard and Craig and the strength of 3 women for Sharon Who I thought was beautiful and intelligent When I was a boy I had a huge crush on her Now I can see why on my DVD set The box is very nice and it comes with a free booklet all about the series I also thought that Trymane was a good boss firm but he got things done
Monty Berman and Dennis Spooner followed up The Baron with this a fantasy series about three superhuman spies which preempted The Six Million Dollar Man It was a favourite of mine when I was a youngster and I enjoy watching it still Stuart Damon and William Gaunt had an unmistakable on screen chemistry as Craig Stirling and Richard Barrett while the luscious Alexandra Bastedo pouted her way through her role as Sharron Macready The late Anthony Nicholls made a wonderfully gruff Tremayne By far the best episodes were those written by Tony Williamson Terry Nation and Brian Clemens while Spooner s own The Interrogation compared favourably with The Prisoner I regret that there was never a second series the concept had so much life left in it Would Craig and Richard have been competitors for Sharron s affections What if Tremayne had learned of the Champions powers Did the Champions have any other abilities other than those we saw We never found out alas
I was 10 years old when this show was on TV By far it was my favorite The actors were very credible Alexandra Bastedo was just gorgeous I just order the DVD 15 episodes They didn t have super powers They just had superior human skills strength hearing sight The 3 actors were very good in their rolls very believable There was a good story in each episode At the time there were no special effects or explosions everywhere so the script was suppose to be good and the characters performs were great There was no fancy stuff like in other shows They didn t try to make a joke every 2 minutes to make a light show I highly recommend this TV show to anybody that like good stuff
i would have to say that this is the first quality romantic comedy i have ever seen it had depth and although you knew from the beginning who was going to end up together there was still longing and anticipation the thought that maybe they won t get together it is an indie film after all this movie was well written directed and acted the dancing on the side of the road scene was magnificent
The influence of Hal Hartley in Adrienne Shelly s I ll Take You There is not overt but clearly has ties to his work Shelly has acted in two of Hartley s films Not only does her film exhibit a very tight narrative but the hyper stylized and extreme characters strangely render human emotion in a very real light Though this film is not ironic on the whole thank God the small and subtle ironies that pepper the piece allude to the bitter truths in love and loss With beautiful cinematography and a soundtrack straight from the seventies I ll See You There is a great indie film that doesn t stoop to postmodern irony when dealing with the woes of love and the reality of human emotion br br The film begins with Bill s life falling to pieces Not only has he sold his best friend Ray a beautiful country home but his wife Rose has left him in order to join Ray in the retreat All washed up Bill wallows in his own gloom and doom until his sister Lucy played by the director Adrienne Shelly brings him all kinds of surprises a self help book and a date for her traumatized brother br br The unwilling Bill tries to refuse but the sudden appearance of Bernice at his door leaves him no choice No doubt Bernice s initially superficial demeanor and ridiculous hairstyle detract from his ability to rebound with her However her pseudo hippie qualities annoy him so much that he lashes at her on their first date And Bernice is so traumatized by his derogatory remarks that she attaches herself to him forcing herself upon him To what end we are not aware except for maybe the fact that she is psycho And who better to play the psycho than Ally Sheedy br br Aware that Bill desperately wants to see Rose Bernice offers her car but on the condition that he take her somewhere first On the way she proceeds to hold Bill prisoner with his own gun a Pinkerton Detective no less An imbroglio of angst resentment redemption passion and violence ensue as Bill and Bernice find themselves on their way to the country home of Ray and Rose of course with a few stops along the way
This movie is wonderful The writing directing acting all are fantastic Very witty and clever script Quality performances by actors Ally Sheedy is strong and dynamic and delightfully quirky Really original and heart warmingly unpredicatable The scenes are alive with fresh energy and really talented production
I too have gone thru very painful personal loss Twice and this movie portrays the gut wrenching reality of that experience very well Life out of balance nothing makes sense well meaning relatives etc br br It was nice to see Ally again She is one of my all time favorite movie actors br br I laughed and cried as the story unfolded Great story and cast Well done
Real cool smart movie I loved Sheedy s colors especially the purple car Alice Drummond is Wise And Wonderful as Stella I liked Sheedy s reference to how her face had gotten fatter The roadside dance scene is brilliant Really liked this one
I was totally impressed by Shelley Adrienne s Waitress 2007 This movie only confirms what was clear from that movie Adrienne was a marvelously talented writer director an original and unique artist She managed to show the miseries of everyday life with absurd humor and a real warm optimistic and humanistic tendency Ally Sheedy steals this movie with a terrific performance as a woman who has fallen over the edge Male lead Reg Rodgers looking like Judd Nelson is fine There is also a great cameo by Ben Vereen The song at the end of the movie The Bastard Song written by Adrienne can stand as her optimistic eulogy br br It s a world of suffering br br In a sea of pain br br No matter how much sun you bring br br You re pummeled by the rain br br Don t let the heartless get you down br br Don t greet the heartless at your door br br Don t live among the heartless
I ll Take You There tells of a woebegone man who loses his wife to another and finds an unlikely ally in a blind date Unlike most romantic comedies this little indie is mostly tongue in cheek situational comedy featuring Rogers and Sheedy with little emphasis on romance A sort of road trip flick with many fun and some poignant moments keeps moving stays fresh and is a worthwhile watch for indie lovers
This comedy with much underlying pain and sadness succeeds where most others fail There have been many films of this genre with more notable actors attempting to achieve this elusive mixture which haven t come anywhere near the depth and deftness of this one This is surely because the exceptional cast with outstanding performances by Reg Rogers and Ally Sheedy seem so spontaneous that the reality of their characters rapidly grip your interest and emotions and hold them throughout the film At first the action seems rather off the wall and harebrained but one gradually learns that these two rather pathetic damaged people are desperately and unwillingly trying to heal themselves even if grudgingly through each other Rogers heartrending facial expressions of numb hurt and Sheedy s angry outbursts are so eloquent that one feels them as one observes them You will care about these two likable but deeply suffering people and hope that they will succeed because it s in doubt and all hangs on a tenuous emotional thread Hopefully audiences will get to see more of Reg Rogers and Ally Sheedy as this film proves their merit as very accomplished actors beyond doubt
For a long time it seemed like all the good Canadian actors had headed south of the border and I guessed all the second rank ones filled the top slots and that left the dregs for the sex comedies br br This film was a real surprise despite the outlandish plots that are typical of farces the actors seemed to be trying to put something into their characters and what we the viewer got back was almost true suspension of belief When the extras from the music video attacked the evicting police you almost believed it was possible br br If you are a fan of some of the better sex farces Canadian or not you should definitely seek this one out And the big surprise this sex farce is also loaded with some very good nudity
At the end of the movie i still don t know whether i liked it or not So was the case with most of the reviewers But none the less i still feel that the movie is worth a 7 for the amount of efforts put in br br long ago i read a quote THERE ARE 2 KIND OF WRITERS 1 THOSE WHO THINK AND WRITE AND 2 THOSE WRITE AND MAKE THE READERS THINK while here i feel that GUY Ritchie took this way too literally and left all the thinking for the audience br br i felt that the movie was a mixed bag filled with some of THE DEVILS ADVOCATE and FIGHT CLUB br br it is definitely a classic something which no one understands but appreciates br br what i don t understand why stathom Jake Green had a blackout thats how it all began all the riddles and mysteries in the movie have been taken care of except this one br br well if you are reading this review to find the solution as what this movie was all about i ll post the very midnight it strikes me and if you are still deciding to watch this movie or not then answer this first when you come across a puzzle labeled as no one has ever solved would you like to try br br i would
Aside from a few titles and the new Sherlock Holmes movie I think I ve watched every movie Guy Ritchie has directed Twice Needless to say I m a big fan and Revolver is one of the highlighted reasons why This movie is a very different approach from Ritchie when you look at it comparatively with Lock Stock and Snatch Revolver sets us up for a psychological thriller of sorts as a gambling con finds himself at the mercy of a set of foes he didn t expect and a guided walk for redemption that he didn t know he needed Along with seeing Andr√© Benjamin of OutKast fame strut his acting ability other standout acts are Ray Liotta playing the maniacal Mr D Macha and Mark Strong playing Sorter the hit man br br After being sent to prison by a tyrannous casino owner Macha Jake uses his time in solitary to finesse a plot to humiliate Macha and force his hand in compensating him for the seven years he spent When he wins a card game and amasses a decent sum from Macha Jake finds himself on the brink of death as he collapses and is diagnosed with an incurable disease that s left him with three days to live A team of loan sharks however have an answer for him and a ticket to life only if he gives them all the money he has and relents to working for them all in a ploy to both take Macha down and show Jake how dangerous he has made himself to himself Along with having the air of death loom and a pair of loan sharks having a field day with his money Jake also has to deal with having a hit put out on him which introduces Sorter a hit man under Macha s employ The depth with the story comes when Jake realizes that some co convicts he spent time with in solitary may very well be the loan shark team out to take him for all he has by crafting all of the unfortunate events that Jake seems to find his way into When faced with this reality though Zack Vincent Pastore and Avi show Jake just how twisted he has become from being in solitary having only the company of his mind and his ego then makes it so that their actual existence is elusive even to Jake The movie unravels to a humbling process for both Jake and Macha as they both come to grips with their inner demons br br The style of the movie is top notch as you get the gritty feel of the crime world represented and the characters it includes Although a lot of nods at Ritchie s previous films are here it still has a presence of its own from the dialogue the sets and the experimental take on the gangster genre It s also a great trip on humility and recognizing when you can easily let your ego or a preset notion mask you ability to accomplish what you want or overcome what you should The characters are well crafted in this movie with all sides being fleshed out and true to Ritchie fashion they re all tied in by some underhandedness that throws a wrench in everyone s affairs I could and would like to go on about this film and its unique nuances but I don t want to take too much away from it if you haven t seen it yet br br It may take a few sittings to get through all the intricate layers but it s a great movie and it should be seen If you re lucky and you haven t seen the watered down US release see if you can get the original UK version as it will make for a great discussion piece among friends as you try to puzzle in your take I saw it with my crew around early 2006 and we re still talking about it with little things we ve picked up on today It has garnered its cult status and it s well deserved as the film where Ritchie stepped out the box and broke his norm a bit br br Standout Line Fear or revere me but please think I m special We share an addiction We re approval junkies
Ah Ritchie s made another gangster film with Statham thought the average fan expecting another Snatch Lock Stock expecting perhaps a couple of temporal shifts but none too hard for me and the lads to swallow after a few beers br br Ah pay attention you do need to watch this film No cups of tea no extra diet cokes from the counter no keep it running shouts as you nip to the fridge watch the film No laughs other than those you may make yourself from the considerable violence and if that floats your boat so be it but sharp solid direction excellent dialogue and great performances br br My favourite Big Pussy from The Sopranos always a reliable hood
I have just finished watching this film and I can honestly say that this is a work of art I was very surprised to see the overall rating as 5 2 br br Not only does Guy bring together a b list ish movie cast and make them into such glorious characters he has given us a movie with a fantastically diverse story line with much left to the imagination br br Far too many people are wanting movies with a plot that can be understood and handed to them on a plate yet these are the films that get poor reviews because they are far too predictable br br This film is special Get it now
I m giving ten out of ten it s one of the best movies ever Absolutely smashed stunned and dazed by the whole picture marvellous playing of Jason Statham Ray Liotta and all the crew amazing plot Just look into yourself and pluck up your courage to admit it touched your soul because it s strange but there are all the answers you ve been ever looking for The very best mr Ritchie THE VERY BEST EVER Those who were looking for a simple figtings and skirmish keep yelling they are disappointed But there are lots of shallow movies in Hollywood nowadays you can t remember what it was about the next day you had seen it On the contrary Revolver is unique I could have hardly expected it s possible to portray such a clear and genius picture of myself of everyone who was to watch it Absolutely unsurpassed astounding dazzling One can get insight watching this I have no doubt about that Actually no words can express my admiration I m still wondering how it was possible to shoot such a movie after years of giddy Hollywood rubbish we had been watching Thank you from all heart it s simply the best
it s all very simple Jake goes to prison and spends five years with the con and the chess masters they get compassionate about his history of loss and failure and utterly misery that he lives on because of his belief in his mastery of small tricks and control of the rules of small crooks they decide to give Jake the ultimate freedom from his innermost fears from what he believes to be himself for that they take him on a trip where he got to let go all the fear all the pride all the hope to be reborn as true master of his will br br it s a clever movie about the journey of illumination about the infinite gambles and games that we do with and within ourselves 10 10 no doubt
I have never known of a film to arouse such debate in my life Believe me when i say that this film will eventually be remembered as an all time classic I was waiting in anticipation for this film as i had previously loved both Lock Stock and Snatch but after some of the negative reviews i thought i would be very disappointed I absolutely loved this film and i can t wait to see it again This film is totally different to both of the aforementioned Ritchie films and also a lot better I have my pick of favourite directors but none of them have pulled off a move as great as Guy Ritchie has just done with this movie I believe he has taken movie making to another level i know most people will be laughing at this comment guaging the reaction to this film but i believe time will prove me right This movie is very confusing and carried on for much longer than the 2hr or so running time as i couldn t stop thinking about it or trying to piece things together I have now got a pretty good take on everything that happens in this film some answers from endless hours of thinking some answers from reading other people s take on the film and now cannot wait until Sunday when i will see it again I just hope people go to the cinema with an open mind and they will hopefully be rewarded as i and many others have been
Neither the total disaster the UK critics claimed nor the misunderstood masterpiece its few fanboys insist Revolver is at the very least an admirable attempt by Guy Ritchie to add a little substance to his conman capers But then nothing is more despised than an ambitious film that bites off more than it can chew especially one using the gangster con artist movie framework As might be expected from Luc Besson s name on the credits as producer there s a definite element of Cinema de look about it set in a kind of realistic fantasy world where America and Britain overlap it looks great has a couple of superbly edited and conceived action sequences and oozes style all of which mark it up as a disposable entertainment But Ritchie clearly wants to do more than simply rehash his own movies for a fast buck and he s spent a lot of time thinking and reading about life the universe and everything If anything its problem is that he s trying to throw in too many influences a bit of Machiavelli a dash of Godard a lot of the Principles of Chess motifs and techniques littering the screen with quotes the film was originally intended to end with three minutes of epigrams over photos of corpses of mob victims and at times it feels as if he never read a fortune cookie he didn t want to turn into a movie Rather than a commercial for Kabbalism it s really more a mixture of the overlapping principles of commerce chess and confidence trickery that for the most part pulls off the difficult trick of making the theosophy accessible while hiding the film s central somewhat metaphysical con br br The last third is where most of the problems can be found as Jason Statham takes on the enemy literally within with lots of ambitious but not always entirely successful crosscutting within the frame to contrast people s exterior bravado with their inner fear and anger but it s got a lot going for it all the same Not worth starting a new religion over but I m surprised it didn t get a US distributor Maybe they found Ray Liotta s intentionally fake tan just too damn scary
Having read the reviews for this film I understandably started watching it with a great deal of doubt in my mind that it would actually be any good However this is one of the best films i have seen in a long time The majority of reviews that i had read said that the complicated plot made it too hard to follow And whilst some parts do leave you confused the ending ties up so many loose ends that you feel like kicking yourself because you ve missed so much It s not like Lock Stock or Snatch in the sense that it isn t that funny in fact it s pretty dark and it is a lot more intelligent in the way that you see parts of scenes from different viewpoints and in one of the best scenes of the film Jason Statham spends five minutes in a lift having an argument with himself The way in which it is similar to the two films i just mentioned is that it is full of memorable characters specifically Statham who gives a fantastic performance as the lead and Ray Liotta who spends most of the film in Speedos but gives a great performance none the less If you ve got time and have time afterwards to think about the film and even watch it again you really start to see all the symbolism and hints that are laid out through the film I think it s fantastic and that Guy Ritchie is a director on top of his game
I will start by saying that this has undeservedly be panned by just about everyone The fact is it wasn t what anyone was expecting especially from Guy Ritchie What everyone was expecting was cockney geezers and good one liners do ya like dags etc but this is far more mature than his previous works I would agree that it is confusing but all the facts are there for us we just have to see them and listen harder this film demands all your attention Look past the cool and dazzling look of the film try to listen to the dialogue rather than admire the performances and i think we will all get a more thorough understanding of the whole film br br Yes this has its influences from modern classics fight club pulp fiction etc but it is in the whole original in both direction and pacing with a music score second to none I feel that if everyone watched this film over and over they would understand it a lot more and maybe appreciate it for the fine piece of modern cinema that it is and i hope also that Ritchie continues in this vain as i far prefer this to his mockney masterpieces
First of all don t go into Revolver expecting another Snatch or Lock Stock this is a different sort of gangster film br br I saw the gala the other night and this movie definitely split the audience It s the kind of movie where half the audience will leave thinking WHAT was that That was awful and the other half will leave thinking WHAT was that That was cool Personally i like films that i don t understand i e Mullholland Drive and Usual Suspects so i enjoyed Revolver br br It definitely wasn t perfect though I saw the big twist coming a mile away at least part of it and though sometimes some loose ends left unexplained is good Revolver leaves A LOT of questions unexplained for no reason it seemed Also some scenes like the animation and the scene where Sorter goes on a killing spree actually one of my favourites although awesome scenes to watch seemed to just be there because they were awesome to watch not because they fit in with the movie br br However there were many good things too I thought the acting was superb from all the main actors Jason stratham Ray Liotta Vincent Pastore and even Andre Benjamin who was a pleasant surprise This movie definitely kept my interest with one great suspenseful action packed scene after another When Ray Liotta was being held under the table wow well you have to see it The script was extremely well done and the soundtrack as with most Guy Ritchie films was great br br Though a step below such movies as Fight Club Mullholland Drive and Usual Suspects it was still an awesome fast paced psychological action movie with many twists and turns and tons of scenes you will remember long after the movie is over
I watched to movie today and it just blew my mind away It is a real masterpiece of art and I don t understand why most of the people think it s garbage The main idea of the movie take your ego away and then you will have true power This was the main battle at the end of the movie and Guy Ritchie has shown that in a magnificent way The greatest enemy will hide in the last place you will ever look do you remember this from the movie Because our true enemy is in us it is our ego That voice that always tells us that we are important that gives us our pride that tells us not to give but only to take that creates our aggression that wants to be in control that creates all the negative feelings and thoughts GR expressed this idea in an astonishing way and has shown that the only way to gain true control is when you loose control and you just let go of your personal importance A superb movie
I always enjoy seeing movies that make you think and don t just drip feed the answers to their audience Revolver is one of these films and although many reviewers have stated that it is difficult to follow with a bit of concentration and an open mind I got it First time True it doesn t compare to other mind mucks like The Usual Suspects or Memento but in its own right its an intelligent and thought provoking film br br Another thing I really liked about this film is how damn beautiful it is Every scene every camera angle seems to have been thought about for ages If you see it you ll know what I mean br br So to conclude watch it with an open mind and you may enjoy it If not well no one ever said Revolver is for everyone And that s my 2 cents
First of all when people hear GUY RITCHIE they immediately think of SNATCH Yes Snatch was a good movie but the problem is that everyone associates Guy Ritchie to Snatch They don t expect him to explore new frontiers This movie REVOLVER is different than snatch it s much darker and is very complex The reason I gave a rating of 10 is because I ve had to watch Revolver 3 times to understand everything So this movie toys with your head It s very cleverly written br br This movie is different than Snatch It was done wonderfully the cinematography is beautiful and you can recognize Guy Ritchie s personal touch style of directing in it br br What won me over was the complexity of the protagonist and how we are left with more questions than answers
OK this movie so far has been slated by critics and board posters alike although playing devil s advocate you could suggest that critics are often people who didn t make it for themselves as film makers and board posters are often people who didn t make it for themselves as critics so I wanted to sit in Guy s corner with the magic sponge to perhaps reach maybe a couple of the people who ve decided not to see the film based on how everybody seems to be looking down their collective nose of approval at it br br The film s biggest flaw in earning wide support is how unexpectedly complex it is This has been described many times as as making the film inaccessible to the viewer The film s chronology is relatively non linear and the characters are used as not only a means of storytelling but as a device for showing us the subtle or not so subtle hints of bias we give things as we commit them to memory IE Ray Liotta s character brandishing a gun saying the words fear me is portrayed as both tragically pathetic from Statham s POV or interrogating and bold from Liotta s POV This is but one example of Ritchie s far more mature approach he has taken to film making with Revolver we have a storyline which is pretty archetypal the strong but silent gritty anti hero gets released from jail with a score to settle but gets drawn inadvertently into a world of corruption I mean it s paint by numbers film noir here guys all the way down to the vague poetic choice of diction and the gritty voice overs but then Guy has taken this framework to make a number of extremely philosophical and complex points br br Take the scene where Jason Statham s character runs afoul of a car This throwaway sequence could have been emitted from the film and made no difference to the story whatsoever but Ritchie is making point about how such little chance happenings such as receiving a phone call can make the difference between life and death br br So the final act of the movie is pretty mind boggling I d be taking the p ss if I said I didn t spend the last 20 minutes or so of the film turning to my date going uh wtf but that is the shoddiest reason to disregard a piece of art It is far too easy to dislike something because you find it hard to understand And even easier to say well nobody else seemed to understand it so it must be a real turd of a film In my humble opinion Revolver is a stylish complex and mature piece of modern art which should be greeted with the same manner we would give the work of the Saatchi Brothers If we choose this opportunity to collectively say Ah sh t I wanted a film about a load of bleeding cockney gangsters in nit loll Guy Ritchie is a tit then the day will come when film makers are allowed only to make that which is expected of them by shallow crappy people Just because Guy made a name for himself with funny cheeky cockney romps doesn t mean he can t be deep without being pretentious Funny people can be thoughtful too
I watched this movie when I was almost quite a kid and naturally was moved to tears by this story of a fox family The fantastic scenery at Hokkaid√¥ the excellent storytelling and last not least the wonderful soundtrack provide a rare intimacy with the protagonists I am still searching for some copy of the gorgeous soundtrack To German viewers it might be useful to know that the DEFA dubbing is the only one worth listening to I taped both DEFA and BR but I keep viewing the first one only
Glacier Fox is one of the most heartrending and wonderfully photographed wildlife films ever made br br The film makes you care about each member of this fox family from the blind cub to the strongest their adventures are at times hilarious and also tragic Set against an inhospitable countryside the audience s hearts warm to the family members br br The music score and lyrics tell the story intercut with narration about what is happening in general terms br br Man remains one of the biggest predators but we are left in no doubt that the foxes are capable of living not just surviving beyond human endeavours
br br I saw The Glacier Fox in the theatre when I was nine years old I bugged my parents to take me back three times I began looking for it on video about five years ago finally uncovering a copy on an online auction site but I would love to see it either picked up by a new distributor and rereleased I understand the original video run was small or have the rights purchased by The Family Channel Disney etc and shown regularly It is a fascinating film that draws you into the story of the life struggle of a family of foxes in northern Japan narrated by a wise old tree The excellent soundtrack compliments the film well It would be a good seller today better than many of the weak offerings to children s movies today
I have been looking for this movie for so many years I saw this move when I was nine and loved this movie I called Disney all the movie stores and the net No luck What a waste it was a very good movie It will be missed
I saw this movie when I was little It was called Glacier Fox I was totally traumatized by it It follows a cute little fox family around The beginning was great and I remember becoming very attached to the little foxes I also remember my mother carrying me out of the theater while I was in hysterics I won t tell you what happened but let s just say it doesn t end well for all of the foxes I was used to Disney type nature films where the animals don t REALLY die Oh man This movie made me cry for hours It was a good movie I think I was really little and truth be told all I remember is being happy for the foxes and then seeing one of them die Rent it if you can but don t show your kids
I recommend families if possible to show this to older children only Some of the stuff in this film maybe too disturbing for little ones to handle Now that thats out of the way let me explain about this movie This is in reality a documentary of a male fox who in the beginning is protecting his territory and seeking a mate The beginning with the gorgeous sunrise and music score is breath taking You had better soak in as much of the scenery as possible it ll get ugly later They gave both the fox and the vixen names but I can t remember what they are for the likes of me He fights off this invading male to win her love They later on create a den and the vixen gives birth to four adorable cubs one of which is blind There are many happy and playful moments featuring the fox family but tragedy and bad luck strike all too soon The first victim is the blind pup who gets too close to a high tide and is washed away The second victim is the mother who while stealing chickens is deceived by a dead chicken hanging on a pole She unknowingly walks into a foot trap While trying to escape she rips off part of her foot causing her to bleed to death The rest of the fox family is forced to watch her die under a tree The male is now a single dad forced to take on the roll of mom and dad He alone has to teach them the skills they need for life It later proves not to be enough when two of the now grown pups meet an ugly fate of their own thanks to the carelessness and cruelity of man I won t spoil the surprising ending for you but it does show the farmer and his dogs close on his tail And it is a well deserved ending after what the audience and the fox family was put through I wanted to say that I saw this when it first came out in early 1980s when we had a thing called Showbiz cable I was only 4 when I saw it but I could never understand why they wouldn t let me see all of it Now I know why after I secretly watched it when it came on Disney when I was 9 I felt emotionally gutted after seeing all this evil going on I was moved to tears But as dark and ugly as it was it serves a purpose To let people what is going to these and other kinds of animals and why they are endangered This documentary wanted to get the message across about this endangered species and I hoped it worked Its not fake like the True life nature films by Disney they don t teach about why animals are going extinct The encroachment of land the killing off of the foxes main prey and senseless killing of these beautiful animals has resulted in them becoming endangered I wish they would make sequel to this movie Glacier Fox 2005 to see if they re being treated better Maybe have it be about a vixen pup named Teresa and her siblings growing up This movie also kind of reflects what happens to human families sometimes especially when one of the parents suddenly dies The surviving parent takes on the roll of both and tries to teach the important lessons of life It isn t always enough to protect them when they re adults especially when some of their lives becomes ruined Or they fall victims to tragedy themselves Best all around soundtrack and musical score I ve ever heard
The villian in this movie is one mean sob and he seems to enjoy what he is doing that is what I guess makes him so mean I don t think most men will like this movie especially if they ever cheated on their wife This is one of those movies that pretty much stays pretty mean to the very end But then there you have it a candy bar ending that makes me look back and say HOKIE AS HELL A pretty good movie until the end Ending is the ending we would like to see but not the ending to such a mean beginning And then there is the aftermath of what happened Guess you can make up your own mind about the true ending I m left feeling that only one character should have survived at the end
This film made John Glover a star Alan Raimy is one of the most compelling character that I have ever seen on film And I mean that sport
Successful self made married businessman Harry Mitchell a superbly steely performance by Roy Scheider has an adulteress fling with sweet n sexy young stripper Cini the gorgeous Kelly Preston Harry s blackmailed by a trio of scummy low life hoods sleazy porno theater manager Raimy a splendidly slimy John Glover antsy strip joint owner Leo well played by Robert Trebor and crazed pimp Bobby Shy a frightfully intense Clarence Williams III who have videotaped his affair with Cini When Harry refuses to pay up the hoods kill Cini and make it look like Harry did it This in turn ignites a dangerous battle of wit and wills between Harry and the hoods Director John Frankenheimer adopting a tough script based on Elmore Leonard s gritty crime thriller novel expertly maintains a steady snappy pace delivers plenty of gripping tension and effectively creates a compellingly seedy n sordid atmosphere The leads are all uniformly excellent with stand out supporting turns by Ann Margret as Harry s bitter neglected wife Barbara Vanity as brash jaded prostitute Doreen and Lonny Chapman as Harry s loyal business partner Jim O Boyle The tight n twisty plot keeps viewers on their toes throughout The wickedly profane dialogue Jost Vacano s glossy cinematography Gary Chang s stirring score the harshly amoral tone and the rousing conclusion are all likewise on the money as well As an added bonus both Vanity and Preston take their clothes off A very strong and satisfying little number that s well worth checking out
Life s going not to badly for Harry Mitchell he s an ex air force major plus nifty little pension I imagine who s raking in the cash for a patent he s developed fusing titanium and steel via explosive process creating super metal fit for NASA and his wife of twenty odd years has kept herself in pretty good nick He s got a nice little pad in LA I like to see visions of the 80s consumer dream and you get a good slice here what with the restored silver Jag a series 1 E type roadster for him and the gorgeous antique dolls house for her as well as I m sure other trinkets and boys toys There s always got to be more though hasn t there So Harry let s himself get caught up in some romantic shenanigans you re only as old as the woman you re feeling As in many films noir one mistake in an otherwise blotch less life leads to a downwards arc for Harry br br Three blackmailers leech onto him These are where the value are for me great character actors playing very believable roles Bobby Shy played by Clarence Williams III is a black ex con who is capable of performing incredible psychopathic acts in order to avoid jail and punish double crossers He s reminiscent of Pluto the vicious black ex con psychopath from Carl Franklin s well regarded neo noir One False Move 1992 There s a similar character motivation I believe Both men have had enough of the man and well pretty much everyone in extremis Robert Trebor plays Leo Franks a fat lily livered pansy who runs a nudie parlour where gents can photograph nude models at 25 for half an hour and 50 for a whole hour did anyone else guffaw at the lack of discount He s in over his head and it s great to watch Trebor acting when Leo starts to feel the heat believable breakdown John Glover wins as Alan Raimy who is the brains of the plot an actually brilliant man who becomes a pornographer and turns to a life of crime out of sheer sociopathic ennui He s a sexual sadist and does a few particularly unpleasant things during the movie including what I believe is a pretty well implied rape pay attention to his RAP sheet readout it s easily missed and read between the lines for the motel scene with Slim br br In common with One False Move though not exclusively I think the real impact of the movie is in the unusually communicative scenes of violence br br So far so good but I think there s a real problem with the film Harry Mitchell is told at one point that he has his tit in the wringer My problem is that Harry Mitchell is played by Roy Scheider Roy Scheider protagonists never lose they re self sure and smooth but not in an annoying way I feel I m being asked to believe that his character is in peril the movie relies on this for dramatic tension however I didn t believe it For me it s like being asked to believe that Sandra Bullock s character is going to end up sleeping alone by the end of a romantic drama or Stephen Seagal s character is going to get taken down by the baddies did actually happen in one movie but was done deliberately for shock value Roy Scheider doesn t convince as an adulterer either you don t feel any annoyance with him at all his character is Teflon coated br br It also felt like a movie that took some cuts At 110 minutes it still feels underdeveloped Harry s wife Ann Margaret is pretty much a cardboard cutout an extension of Harry her back story as a politician running for office receives scant attention The effect that the affair has on Harry s marriage isn t properly communicated This could be a Frankenheimer problem he s not known for character development I never felt that Harry was dealing with little more than an overtly annoying and erroneous tax claim from the IRS br br There is good sleazy violent noir content in this film but I feel that to be in the excellent bracket that the casting of Harry could have been done better no disrespect to the great Roy Scheider The film felt short even with the long running time and I think could have taken some more fleshing out br br But you really can t forget the sleaze like the deliciously pervy scene of Harry taking photos of Doreen in the nudie parlour
52 Pick Up never got the respect it should have It works on many levels and has a complicated but followable plot The actors involved give some of their finest performances Ann Margret Roy Scheider and John Glover are perfectly cast and provide deep character portrayals Notable too are Vanity who should have parlayed this into a serious acting career given the unexpected ability she shows and Kelly Preston who s character will haunt you for a few days Anyone who likes action combined with a gritty complicated story will enjoy this
This is a great small film I say small because it doesn t have a hundred guns firing or a dozen explosions as in a John Woo film Great performances by Roy Scheider and the three bad guys John Frankenheimer seems to have more luck with small productions these days The film is very easy to watch the story is more of a yarn than a washing machine instead of everything going around and around it seems as though things just get worse as the plot thickens Wonderful ending very positive I never read the Elmore Leonard book but it can t be much different from the film because it FEELS like I m watching an Elmore Leonard movie
This slick and gritty film consistently delivers It s one of Frankenheimer s best and most underrated films and it s easily the best Elmore Leonard adaptation to date and if you are scratching your head thinking but I loved GET SHORTY you need to be punched in the face In my opinion no one captures the feel for Leonard s characters better then John Glover in 52 PICK UP The relocation of the story from Detroit novel to Hollywood film elevates the story s sleaze factor to amazing heights Be a man have a few beers and watch this movie For reference purposes my favorite Leonard books are Swag Rum Punch Cat Chaser City Primeval and 52 Pick Up My favorite Frankenheimer films include SECONDS and THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE I also have a real special place in my cold movie heart for DEAD BANG and BLACK Sunday
I ve always liked this John Frankenheimer film Good script by Elmore Leonard and the main reason this wasn t just another thriller is because of Frankenheimer His taut direction and attention to little details make all the difference he even hired porn star Ron Jeremy as a consultant You can make a case that its the last good film Roy Scheider made I ve always said that Robert Trebor gave just a terrific performance Clarence Williams III got all the publicity with his scary performance and he s excellent also but I really thought Trebor stood out Frankenheimer may not be as proud of this film as others but it is an effective thriller full of blackmail murder sex drugs and real porno actors appear in sleazy parts What can you say about a film that has Ann Margaret being shot up with drugs and raped A guilty pleasure to say the least Vanity has a real sleazy role and a very young Kelly Preston makes an early appearance A classic exploitive thriller that shouldn t be forgotten
Based on Elmore Leonard this is a violent and intelligent action film The story a business man is blackmailed by some 3 criminals Roy Schieder does great job as the leading character and special credit s got to go to John Glover who plays sort of a naughty psychopath I must mention that the villains characters are very complex and interesting something that is very rare for an action film also features some beautiful and sexy women most notable are Kelly Preston as the young bate for Schieder s character Vanity gives a very good performance and appearance as the hooker who is connected with the three blackmailers I m glad to say that Ann Margaret still hasn t lost it this lady is a true babe Don t look at the rate of this film I really don t know what the public and some critics have against this film but my suggestion is to ignore them and watch this truly gripping and under rated film You will enjoy it that s a promise Recommended A
Spoilers br br From the very moment I saw a local film critic trash this movie in a review on the 10 00 news I wanted to see it I don t remember who it was or which local Omaha newscast carried the review but the critic was very insistent that this film was way too sleazy for the average church going Nebraskan They showed a snippet from the scene where John Glover is about to kidnap Ann Margret when she s swimming in the pool Glover s character is commending her on how nice her body is and so forth using many words that the local station felt necessary to edit out I was hooked There was one problem though I was only 13 years old at the time and I had to wait a year until it came out on cable Let s just say it was worth the wait br br If ever there was a guilty pleasure of mine this movie is it To call this film sleazy would be a huge understatement The film centers around a successful businessman who is blackmailed by three small time scumbags after an affair with a young woman Roy Scheider who is as effective as ever plays the poor guy who just wanted a little fling and now finds himself at the mercy of three terrific villains John Glover s character is one of the most memorable scumbags of all time He s sleazy funny at times and always on the brink of doing something crazy Then there s Robert Trebor s nice name by the way character Leo who is clearly in over his head with this blackmail scheme He is a whimpering sweating coward who runs a peep show place with live nude models Then you have Clarence Williams III as Bobby Shy a brooding sociopath who everyone is afraid of with good reason Who could forget the wake up call he gives Vanity with the giant teddy bear br br After dealing with the initial shock of realizing what he s up against Scheider turns the tables on these creeps and takes control of the situation that is until Glover goes after his wife The conflict is played out brutally with virtually the entire cast getting shot raped or blown up br br I don t know why I love this movie so much It really should creep me out but it doesn t Maybe it s because these characters are all interesting and the story takes plenty of chances that most films today would never try It s scary to think that the adult film industry probably has more than a few characters like Glover s running around out in L A looking for trouble Just thinking about his voice is enough to make me chuckle Hey sport have a nice day br br This film has plenty of shootouts cool cars great dialog like the line in my opening statement and decent acting Plenty of cameos by real life porno stars Look for Ron Jeremy frolicking around in a hot tub with two chicks in a party scene at Glover s place br br Another thing I must add How hot are the women in this film Wow Travolta did right by marrying Kelly Preston Yum We also see Vanity get nude in a time before she became a born again Christian And Ann Margret What else could you say about her except that she is the quintessential American Beauty br br 9 of 10 stars br br So sayeth the Hound br br Added Feb 14 2008 RIP Roy Scheider
Brendan Filone is the absolute best character in The Sopranos he died by getting shot in the eye This was the best and well orchestrated scene ever in the Sopranos Brendan Filone is too good Brendan Filone shall haunt Uncle Junior in his dreams until Uncle Junior can t take it anymore Brendan Filone is the best character Brendan Filone was killed in episode 3 Denial anger acceptance But his legacy will live on forever Brendan Filone is the best character on Sopranos Brendan Filone is the best character ever I recommend this show to anyone who likes Drama and wants to see good death scenes and great directing and producing because it doesn t get any better than this series Brendan Filone is the best

The sopranos was probably the last best show to air in the 90 s its sad that its over its was the best show on HBO if not on TV not everything was spelled out for you throughout you had to think it was brilliant the cast was excellent Tony James Gandolphini is a great actor and played his character excellent as well as the others Each character had flaws thats what made them so real and allowed the viewers to connect with them and thats one reason it lasted so long The last episode was good I m not sure how to take it many different things can be construed by the ending id like to think that tony didn t die but meadow walked in and sat down with them and that the blackout was just for suspense Tony will have to go to trial and deal with that hopefully is not dead thats how i feel Long live the Sopranos and Tony Soprano
Now i have read some negative reviews for this show on this website and quite frankly I m appalled For anyone to even think that the Sopranos is not Television then i m afraid i don t know what the world has come to Let me tell u something I started watching many T V shows like Lost Prison Break Dexter Deadwood and even Invasion But all of those shows lost their touch after the first season especially Lost and Prison Break which i refuse to watch because the companies took 2 genius ideas and butchered them by making more than one season Then we have The Sopranos I can honestly say that this is the only television series that i have ever watched where i have been enthralled in all of its season and more importantly all of its episodes There is no department that this show doesn t excel in Acting Nothing short of superb James Gandolfini is one of my favourite actors and i feel that his acting is absolutely stunning in every episode after i heard that HBO wanted Ray Liotta to play Tony i felt that it would ve been the better choice however after watching the first few episodes i knew that HBO had done a great job in casting James as Tony The raw emotion he displays is superb Then we have everyone else Edie Falco Michael Imperioli Lorraine Bracco Dominic Chianese whom i remembered as Johnny Ola in the Godfather Part 2 and my personal two favourite characters Tony Sirico and Steve Van Zandt Paulie Walnuts Gualtieri and Silvio Dante All of these actors perform to the best quality and all giving an excellent performance in each episode Then we have the story never have i been so sucked into a T V show before The story is nothing short of excellent Each episode is directed superbly and the Score of this show is just fantastic I feel that The Sopranos is one show that i can watch again and again and never get bored of Its got everything from hilarious humour to brutal violence but nonetheless it is and will always be the best thing to ever grace the Television and I challenge anyone to find a real flaw in the show Not just say its too violent or they feel that the character of Tony is immoral i mean it is a mafia show at the end of the day i don t think that the characters are going to be very honest or loyal to God I implore everyone to watch this show because believe me you ll be hooked from the very first episode i was and i have even gotten a few friends who had firstly refused to watch the show hooked on it Trust me when i say that this show is a Godsend compared to the crap that comes on T V After you ve watched the first season you ll inevitably agree with me when i once again say that this show dominates Television and no T V show current or future will ever upstage the marvel that is The Sopranos
The Godfather of television but aside from it s acclaim and mobster characters the two are nothing alike Tony Soprano is forced to go to a psychiatrist after a series of panic attacks His psychiatrist learns that Tony is actually part of two families in one family he is a loving father yet not so perfect husband and in the other family he is a ruthless wiseguy After analysis Dr Melfi concludes that Tony s problems actually derive from his mother Livia who s suspected to have borderline personality disorder Gandolfini is rightfully praised as the main character yet Bracco and Marchand aren t nearly as recognized for their equally and talented performances as the psychiatrist and mother respectively Falco Imperioli and DeMatteo are acclaimed for their brilliant supporting roles Van Zandt from the E Street Band plays his first and only role as Tony s best friend and is quite convincing and latching Chianese the only recurring actor to have actually appeared in a Godfather film plays Tony s uncle and on and off nemesis Many fans also enjoyed characters played by Pastore Ventimiglia Curatola Proval Pantoliano Lip Sciorra and Buscemi Tony s children are okay but not notable with the exception of Iler s stunning performance in the third to last episode The Second Coming Sirico and Schirripa are unconvincing and over the top but the show is too strong for them to hold it back Even as the show continues for over six season it ceases to have a dull or predictable moment br br out of four
As the Godfather saga was the view of the mafia from the executive suite this series is a complex tale of the mafia from the working man s point of view If you ve never watched this show you re in for an extended treat Yes there is violence and nudity but it is never gratuitous and is needed to contrast Tony Soprano the thinking man s gangster with the reality of the life he has been born to and quite frankly would not ever have left even knowing how so many of his associates have ended up Tony Soprano can discuss Sun Tzu with his therapist then beat a man to death with a frying pan in a fit of rage and while dismembering and disposing of the body with his nephew take a break sit down and watch TV while eating peanut butter out of the jar and give that nephew advice on his upcoming marriage like they had just finished a Sunday afternoon of viewing NFL football Even Carmella his wife when given a chance for a way out finds that she really prefers life with Tony and the perks that go with it and looking the other way at his indiscretions versus life on her own If you followed the whole thing you know how it ends If you didn t trust me you ve never seen a TV show end like this
Though The Sopranos is yet another gift from the megahit The Godfather and sequels which dramatized and to a certain extent glamorized the mafia The Sopranos takes another tack No suited up classy mobsters here with homes in Lake Tahoe and stakes in Vegas casinos these guys are goombahs with a front of waste management who deal with things that fall off the back of trucks topless bars protection money in short what the neighborhood mobs were all about br br Colorful characters dominate this series which doesn t hold back on the sex and graphic violence Tony Soprano James Gandolfini is a mob head with a wife and two children living in New Jersey who suffers from panic attacks as he tries to balance his biological family with his mafia one To get to the bottom of his attacks he sees a psychiatrist Jennifer Melfi Lorraine Bracco who is afraid of him and yet attracted to him at the same time Tony s henchman Paulie his nephew Christopher his Uncle Junior the titular head of the mob his good friend Pussy are all fully fleshed out characters br br As we learn going through the series there are enemies not only from without but from within and one of those enemies includes Tony s sickly but horrible mother Nancy Marchand who convinces Junior that Tony is a danger to him Tony s sister Janice meanwhile is searching for money in her mother s house with a stethoscope and a Geiger counter Tony has mistress problems and a wife Edie Falco who puts up with a lot because she loves him all the while keeping ties to her Catholic religion The church frowns on divorce she tells one woman contemplating a split Let the Pope live with him is the response As far as Tony s mistress problems his psychiatrist points out that Tony is attracted to demanding women for whom nothing is ever enough and asks him if it sounds familiar Yeah it sounds like his mother br br I m of Italian descent and yes I m sick of Italians being shown in a negative light and everyone assuming all Italians are mobsters Yet you can t help liking this show which is a constant reminder of our culture Thanksgiving it s pointed out isn t turkey and sweet potato pie it s the antipasto the manicotti the meatballs and escarole and then the bird Not to mention the right on pronunciation of words like melenzana mullinyan escarole scarole manicotti manigot etc The only un Italian thing about Tony is that he doesn t have a finished basement something unheard of in the rest of my family except my parents never had one either br br The standouts in this show are Gandolfini as a ruthless gangster on antidepressants Falco who is brilliant as his wife and Bracco as the tortured Jennifer But everyone is excellent If you can take the violence and the language this is a great show an unrelenting portrait of New Jersey mob life
The Sopranos is probably the most widely acclaimed TV series ever so naturally my expectations were through the roof and yet the show surpassed them I love the mafia and crime genre in film and I enjoy following the compelling stories set in these worlds but this is so much more 86 hours of material gives the story a chance to not only be one of the most thrilling and unpredictable mafia action stories but also to be a great family drama a shocking character study a laugh out loud comedy a brilliant psychological examination dealing with the nature of good and evil and an intellectual arty collaboration of representative dreams and hallucinations all in one David Chase s epic series manages to accomplish all of this and more and cements HBO as the closest TV can get to cinematic perfection paving the road for a number of other series to continue blowing audiences away br br Realism is present when it is needed but Chase s decisions to depart from it for effect on occasion for dream episodes and the like only adds more layers to the series Chase along with a strong writing staff including Matthew Weiner and Terrence Winter future creators of Mad Men and Boardwalk Empire respectively turns New Jersey into an intricate universe full of the greatest cast of characters I ve seen on TV br br James Gandolfini domineers the show as Tony one of the most groundbreaking characters on TV ever Tony adheres to half of the mobster stereotypes from pop culture but he defies the other half entirely and through his family interactions and his therapy sessions with Dr Melfi Lorraine Bracco with whom he has a considerable chemistry that ensures that the therapy scenes always have a completely different feel to the rest of the show we see nearly every side to Tony Soprano and learn that he is more of an everyman than one would expect br br Edie Falco matches the power of Gandolfini s performance as Tony s wife Carmela From her mixed feelings about Tony s lifestyle to her suspicions about murders to her torment over Tony s cheating to her own thoughts about infidelity Carmela runs the gamut of emotions throughout 6 seasons and Falco makes her the prime vehicle for the non mafia viewers to have eyes into such a corrupt world Scenes between Tony and Carmela provide some of the most heartwrenching and painfully realistic drama ever seen on television br br The supporting cast is almost as phenomenal and a wide array of characters populate the cast over all six seasons somehow without any redundancies Nancy Marchand steals the show as Tony s overbearing mother Livia an insight into Tony s personality problems and panic attacks The familiarity of Marchand s incessant complaints is almost gruesome since she takes the character so believably far Michael Imperioli is Christopher Tony s prot√©g√© whose various poor choices lead him down a road that is painful to watch but brilliantly executed Drea De Matteo plays Christopher s girlfriend Adriana and is so well meaning and loving that the dark arc her character takes as she gets too involved with Christopher s career Tony Sirico is Paulie introduced as the ultimate mafia stereotype and a source of comic but eventually he becomes one of the most sympathetic and complex characters on the show and nobody plays true anger better than he And that s just the tip of the iceberg br br Familiar faces such as Peter Bogdanovich Jon Favreau Ben Kingsley Lauren Bacall Will Arnett Nancy Sinatra David Strathairn Robert Patrick Hal Holbrook Burt Young and Eric Mangini make appearances over the course of the show while names as notable as Joe Pantoliano Steve Buscemi and Steven Van Zandt have regular roles as main characters in the series There are 50 great characters with powerful arcs and the excitement and tension never let up in any of the various subplots throughout the show br br Comedic elements and entire episodes filled with brilliant hilarity dilute the powerhouse dramatic intensity of the series which is so multipurpose that for one reason or enough the credits of nearly any episode left me somewhat bewildered The Sopranos is the most powerful and addicting series I have seen overall and its highs are so mindblowing that I would have to call it my favourite show in spite of arguable lows most of which I disagree with br br Whether you love or hate the ending or what you make of it is irrelevant the discussion it has created is an achievement in itself The iconic nature of the entire series makes it an essential part of television history There are multiple elements for anyone to love and marvel at in this show so if you re thinking of watching something else instead do yourself a favour and fuhgeddaboutit
The Sopranos now preparing to end is the very peak of adult television and drama When The Sopranos hits the mark it really hits the mark Using great writing and great actors most of them being extras from Goodfellas the series is aloud to progress in a satisfyingly unpredictable and exceptional way Heading up the cast is James Gandolfini who for all intensive purposes is Tony Soprano and Edie Falco who certainly holds her own The series also boasts a great collection of regulars to push the plot along by any means necessary usually violence and foul language Tony Sirico Michael Imperioli and Steve Van Zandt are great secondary characters that make every episode more interesting Seasonal extras are also worth note including names like Steve Buscemi great Joe Pantoliano great David Proval good Robert Patrick Robert Loggia and Frank Vincent br br The Sopranos is a great family drama and a realistic interpretation of modern day mafia societies that despite the rare bad story lines manages to be unique TV Symbolism and simple story lines dreams and shoot outs and many other things create intertwining stories and relationships that at the end of each season are resolved to create yet another perfect HBO package Watch it
Well easily my favourite TV series ever Call me a walking mail clich√© but include violence mafia sex gambling drugs etc on a show and you re already winning points on in my book Combine all that with acting that superceeds anything you ve ever seen on the small screen add directing that fits cinema of the vintage type and most of all writing that blows the mind and a few brains a long the way and you got yourself a show thats gonna be pretty tough to compete with br br Above all stand two actors James Gandolfini as Tony Soprano and Edie Falco as His wife Carmela as for Gandolfini he fits his roll in a way that words cannot express if you haven t seen him as tony yet see it now br br I can go on and on and on about every character in the show the psychological brilliance the gripping scenes etc but you wouldn t be able to stop me so all I can say is that this is about the only show along with Seinfeld that I am able to watch over and over again from start to finish and end up enjoying it even more
The Sopranos stands out as an airtight dynamic exploration of American life and how the American experience is shaped and defined by money By setting the story in the milieu of the underworld David Chase eliminates all barriers to a grunt low to the ground and outright mean deconstruction of the post modern era br br Every character represents a facet of American industry Tony Soprano exemplifies the beleaguered working stiff torn between familial duty and a need to keep his business on an even keel The convergence of these two things is the imperative that keeps the story moving forward The characters of Christopher Paulie and Bobby reflect the loyal but self serving underlings present in every enterprise who are trusted out of necessity rather than merit With the character of Ralph Joe Pantoliano essays a brilliant interpretation of the charismatic psychopath a twisted businessman who s flourishes of violence are tragically outweighed by his stunning earning power And Dominic Chianese is the ultimate symbol of the antiquated old guard which maintains power through established relationships and the need of the up and comers to deflect blame br br Though abrasive and occasionally disturbing The Sopranos has earned its place as the ultimate TV drama br br PS A good companion piece to Chase s series would be The Shield another violent drama that manages to make the ugliest of characters interesting
I can t add an awful lot to the positive reviews already on here great acting balanced writing multi faceted characters a great anti hero in Tony great commentary on millennial American life The integral use of psychiatry coupled with Tony s mother issues are especially fresh and humorous Several other characters add a lot of depth Hesh s interesting history as an outsider muscling in Ralphie s total irredeemable viciousness Chris dual desires in life and so on br br I have to dig into some of the criticisms however especially the it glorifies violence belittles Italian Americans one Most of the writers and actors are Italian American would they attack themselves There are several positive Italian American characters Artie Bucco the chef Dr Melfi and her family and the Cusamanos next door to the Sopranos Indeed Dr Melfi s ex husband notes in season 1 that only a tiny minority of Italian Americans have ever had Mob connections certainly smaller than the proportion of African Americans involved in crime dare I say it In both cases poverty and lack of opportunity are the biggest causes br br Most of the characters don t really choose the life they have family background or circumstances largely corner them into it Outsiders even of Italian stock who attempt to integrate into it usually meet distressing ends Matthew and his friend in season 2 for example If you criticise this show I assume Frasier made you want to be a psychiatrist or Will Grace made you want to go homosexual Presumably you won t listen to rap music that discusses gangs or r n b which discusses promiscuity or rock music which discusses drugs or any other combination People aren t as stupid as some of you make out br br Not everything is perfect however A lot of characters have only appeared once when by all logic they should have been seen or at least mentioned in previous episodes Tracee the dancer Meadow s friend Ally Uncle Junior s ladyfriend supposedly for 20 years until they split in season 1
The Sopranos is perhaps the most mind opening series you could possibly ever want to watch It s smart it s quirky it s funny and it carries the mafia genre so well that most people can t resist watching The best aspect of this show is the overwhelming realism of the characters set in the subterranean world of the New York crime families For most of the time you really don t know whether the wise guys will stab someone in the back or buy them lunch br br Further adding to the realistic approach of the characters in this show is the depth of their personalities These are dangerous men most of them murderers but by God if you don t love them too I ve laughed at their wisecracks been torn when they ve made err in judgement and felt scared at the sheer ruthlessness of a serious criminal br br The suburban setting of New Jersey is absolutely perfect for this show s subtext people aren t always as they seem and the stark contrast between humdrum and the actions taken by these seemingly petty criminals weigh up to even the odds br br If you haven t already you most definitely should
Take a pinch of GOODFELLAS mix it with THE GODFATHER add some Roman mythology and plenty of lowbrow comedy and you have THE SOPRANOS about a mob clan operating out of northern New Jersey It s almost as entertaining as pro wrestling I am not the biggest fan of this show but I do admire James Gandolfini s very complicated Tony Soprano a psychopath with an occasional glimmer of conscience I also have come to admire te contributions of folks like gravel voiced Dom Chianese as the bewildered but murderous Uncle Junior silver haired Tony Sirico as the perpetually perplexed Paulie and the very beautiful Edie Falco as the duplicitous tough as nails Carmela Soprano The violence is sudden and graphic the body count steadily climbs each season but it is often the small moments that matter most here Watch Paulie and Tony s nephew Christopher Michael Imperioli late of LAW ORDER as they get lost in the Pine Barrens and sit out a bitter cold night in an abandoned trruck both convinced they ve had it
I ve only watched the first series on DVD but would summarise The Sopranos as a Shakespearean plot with a Tarantino like script The series is as good as Goodfellas and Casino and almost as good as The Godfather hence not a 10 and far better than any of Guy Ritchie s efforts Although there s plenty of action some of it pretty bloody the story is character driven Even some of the minor characters contribute to great story lines e g the priest s relationship or lack of with Carmilla and the restaurateur s wife and Christopher and his dimwit friend who didn t last very long a Darwin Award nominee br br Apart from the plot the script and the acting the other reasons I liked it br br 1 It made me want to visit New Jersey and eat pasta with a tomatoey sauce 2 The music 3 It shows that literally anyone can suffer from mental health problems
It probably isn t fair that I have got to see the majority of all the interesting reviews on the Sopranos and then get to add what people have forgotten but oh well br br From a standpoint of acting how could any actor fail with these characters Each one mesmerizing and intense in their pursuits of life Tony Soprano while a mob Capo and suffering from mental illness still sees his life in front of him and knows what has to be done to survive Each of his men you see their lives virtually from the inside like the truest form of voyerism It definitely brings out a sort nosey side in each and every viewer and I include myself in this br br While some above don t care for Bracco I have to say this is the freshest role she has had in years since Good Fellas She is the side of Tony that makes him listen to reason that makes him decent that offers him respite when dealing with his human emotions that he has failed to feel for so long if ever She is simply put his savior Not speaking in religious tones br br But the knockout performance here is without doubt Edie Falco To see her prison guard role in the other acclaimed HBO series Oz and then see her as Livia is the ultimate compliment for any actor or actress She has transcended the boundries of a recognizable actress something only actresses like Merle Streep can get away with A sort of chameleon quality to transcend roles But as I have mentioned before with a characters a strong as these how can any actor fail br br Livia s strength is in her daily affirmation of faith in herself She is a survivor as she hopes her husband and family will be survivors She is prepared for the worst because she knows the hazards of her husband s business yet knows the lifestyle she has is more then most women from Jersey She is wise if not wiser and more street savvy then Tony himself br br All in all the biggest crime from the Soprano Family is that we the viewer have to wait until January 2000 to see the next season This in my opinion is the worst thing about the HBO series It was what brought The Larry Sanders Show Sex and the City Dream On and others back down to earth in popularity and eventually killed them Too much space in between seasons and very sporadic Until then I will watch the reruns with the hope that this gap in programming is filled
I believe that The Sopranos is an awesome show because of all the supporting characters in it i have bought every video so far and am waiting for the rest to be released In all 42 episodes so far the best one is definitely episode 3 Denial Anger Acceptance This episode deals with my most favorite character of all time in The Sopranos His name was Brendan Filone He was killed for hijacking the wrong truck and accidentally killing a truck driver Brendan was awesome because he was actually one of the few characters who actually stood against Tony and his gang In the end he ended up getting shot through the eye while taking a bath and that s my most favorite scene ever in the history of The Sopranos Brendan Filone is 1 for me And my 2 most favorite character ever was Matthew Bevilaqua who was killed after attempting to murder Christopher Moltisanti Tony and Pussy shoot him in Hucklebarney park after they catch and torture him My 3 most favorite character is Sean Gismonte who was killed right after shooting Christopher And finally my 4 most favorite character is Chucky Signore one of Uncle Junior s henchmen He was killed on a boat by Tony All the awesome characters are dead That s the only bad thing about the Sopranos All the cool guys always get killed You know what would be great to change about the Sopranos They should have a whole episode where they show all the dead supporting characters in hell and they are all trying to torture Chris Tony Uncle Junior Silvio and Paulie because they need to get their revenge Brendan Filone shall strike back 1
The Godfather Citizen Kane Star Wars Goodfellas None of the above compare to the complex brilliance of The Sopranos Each and every character has layers upon layers of absolute verity completely and utterly three dimensional We care about Tony Soprano wholeheartedly despite the fact that in the simplest model of good vs evil he is evil Soprano is the most provocative intricate and fascinating protagonist ever created to this point in history If you re in the mood to be overtly challenged as a viewer and to be forever altered on your feelings toward entertainment watch The Sopranos I defy anybody to sit down and watch the very first episode of Season 1 and not want to continue with the series Each season is completely brilliant in its own way DVDs are essential to anybody s collection of out 4
Not only do the storylines in The Sopranos engage audiences from all over but I think for me at least what brings the viewers back is the acting Not even you Gary can dispute that claim James Gandolfini who plays the lead man Tony Soprano has become in this viewer s opinion one of the Hollywood Elites as far as acting in a television series goes I wouldn t go ahead and compare him with Robert DeNiro or Al Pacino or at least not just yet He however does do a hell of a job playing the part of Tony Soprano In the years since 1999 Gandolfini has risen so much so as an actor mainly thanks to his role in The Sopranos that today he is considered to be among the best in the business And it s not just him The Sopranos fields a great supporting cast including that of Lorraine Bracco Edie Falco Michael Imperioli Dominic Chianese and the late Nancy Marchand who played Tony s dreadful mother At this point in the show s existence it s being considered a cult classic and rightfully so The first two seasons were extraordinary Violent and quite gruesome in a pretty frequent manner but without a doubt extraordinarily done The third season was great but didn t quite live up to the hype of seasons 1 and 2 Season 4 which wrapped up right before new years was the weakest season yet or at least in my opinion it was Despite a dry spell I still found it season 4 of The Sopranos to be more entertaining than most of its competition and that s saying a lot because lately I ve been noticing a trend in good new television shows Examples of this Six Feet Under The Shield Curb Your Enthusiasm and OZ which is not technically a new show but ended with an unforgettable final season this year To get back to my point though to consider a show better than all the competition during a particularly bad year no less is quite an accomplishment on the part of the writers The Sopranos ranks above and beyond all other television shows in its era and its writers deserve a lot of credit To close I d like to say The Sopranos is the real deal folks For the average mature viewer 17 and above who enjoys drama and doesn t mind a mixing of a little violence and profanity you might want to check out The Sopranos if you get the chance Trust me in that it will be well worth the time
The gangster genre is now a worn subject one that is too often subjected to parody In retrospect the series is a culmination of previous clich√©s that have been utilized in it s genre thankfully the writers have advanced upon this flaw by creating a realism which has been applied to it The Sopranos is an epic crime saga that illustrates it s content with psychological depth that is characterized with subtle nuance humor and unvarnished violence The key protagonist Tony Soprano is perceived as a perilous general bereft of fear and moral values by his crew however Tony is of two persona s one which is bestial while the other is conflicted with guilt and resent With out any inhibitions or contradictions I still adamantly believe that The Sopranos has the finest ensemble cast of recent memory All things considered I could make an elaborate statement on the series but I won t If ever there is a visual dictionary in global consumerism search for these definitions vital ambiguous unrelenting epic uncompromising and the sopranos shattered visage will be smiling right back at you
There are so many reasons as to why I rate the sopranos so highly one of its biggest triumphs being the cast and character building Each character unfolds more and more each series Also each series has an array of different small time characters as well as the main A good example of a character who was only in three episodes who you can feel for is David the compulsive gambler played brilliantly by Robert Patrick Every little detail builds the perfect TV series The show revolves round mob boss Tony Soprano James Gandolfini who attempts to balance his life of crime with his role as father of two The show is not afraid to be bold and powerful with its dialogue and imagery and this is what makes it so believable Whilst Tony runs things with capos Paulie Tony Sirico and Silvio Steve Van Zant his nephew Christopher Michael imperioli looks for a promotion Every episode also features Tony s other family in some way which includes his children and wife carmela soprano Edie Falco On top of these problems is his uncle Junior soprano Dominic Chianese is trying to get what he can out of Tony s businesses despite being under house arrest All the acting is powerful and characters complex but the two who stand out the most are James Gandolfini who is Tony Soprano Also Michael Imperioli who plays Christopher representing the younger 20 30 generation in crime If David Chase had not created this masterpiece modern TV dramas of such caliber may not have existed such as The Wire and Dexter So the Sopranos is definitely the Godfather Goodfellas and Pulp fiction of TV
Wow I LOVED the whole series and am shocked at comments by people who thought it ended badly Perhaps it waffled a bit in seasons 4 5 while remaining better than anything else on television But 6 and particularly 6b were beautiful permutations on the themes developed in the more muscular first three seasons br br 6B started with such a sombre mood and Janice s always keen insight into the family angst that doom filled line about knowing Tony s penchant for sitting and staring Anyone who missed the implications of that for the rest of the series does not know Tony Melfi s discomfort over the psychiatric study and its references to the sociopath s self deluding sentimentality for pets and animals goes back to the first episodes of the series say with Tony s panic attack over the ducks leaving his pool and resonates with Phil s wave bye bye line to his grandchildren before the coup de grace of the final episode not to get into Chase s dark humour br br I could go on and on but I ll just add that I thought the final show starting with the opening strains of Vanilla Fudge to supply the ironic foreshadow You Keep Me Hangin On to the terminal moments where Tony fades back into complacency with his family in tow or blasts apart like AJ s SUV or Phil s head were utterly utterly PERFECT The best TV ever br br Pretty good in a dying medium pathologically supplying the jack off fantasies AJ derides and then into which he promptly subsides A tip of the pork pie to Mr Chase
As a guy who has seen all the seasons I can say that JG constantly surprises me I mean after you saw him shifting from laughter to paranoia instantly throughout the seasons and after every little gesture of his made u believe he is a gangster u thought to yourself OK he is a good actor and he can get into a gangster s skin But after seeing him opening his eyes and struggling for his life I mean I could almost feel the pain he made us believe he was going through I was so touched by his performance that I immediately thought at Robert De Niro Marlon Brando and Al Pacino These guys were definitely the best of their generations and even more But nowadays they are either old or dead Brando and it s OK that they make less movies and their performances are lighter than they used to be I can t wait to see Gandolfini in other movies where he delivers a totally different role Can u recommend me some of his older movies where he gives a memorable performance
When we started watching this series on cable I had no idea how addictive it would be Even when you hate a character you hold back because they are so beautifully developed you can almost understand why they react to frustration fear greed or temptation the way they do It s almost as if the viewer is experiencing one of Christopher s learning curves br br I can t understand why Adriana would put up with Christopher s abuse of her verbally physically and emotionally but I just have to read the newspaper to see how many women can and do tolerate such behavior Carmella has a dream house endless supply of expensive things but I m sure she would give it up for a loving and faithful husband or maybe not That s why I watch br br It doesn t matter how many times you watch an episode you can find something you missed the first five times We even watch episodes out of sequence watch season 1 on late night with commercials but all the language A E with language censored reruns on the Movie Network whenever they re on we re there We ve been totally spoiled now br br I also love the Malaprop s An albacore around my neck is my favorite of Johnny Boy When these jewels have entered our family vocabulary it is a sign that I should get a life I will when the series ends and I have collected all the DVD s and put the collection in my will
Greetings from this Portuguese guy br br I believe The Sopranos are one of the best production ever it has reality and fiction mixed in such a way that it s hard to see the difference It has the same quality as GodFather James Gandolfini fits at the paper as a glove I would love The Sopranos would never finish at all It s perfect It should be a subject in school I saw Sopranos when I was a kid but I was too young to stay waked until the episode ends so now I bought the all Episodes in DVD format and I am watching all episodes at home before and after dinner and I am getting addicted like I did with Prison Break In my opinion Prison Break and The Sopranos are the best ever series made for television The argument of both are splendid and the actors are perfect Congratulations for such a work br br Sorry about my English Thanks for reading

What can you possibly say about a show of this magnitude The Sopranos has literally redefined television as we know it It has broken all rules and set new standards for television excellence Everything is flawless the writing directing and for me most of all the acting Watching this show you ll find yourself realizing that these characters are NOT real The acting tricks you into thinking there is a real Tony Soprano or any character This show is also very versatile Some people don t watch the show because it s violent it s not all about the violence it s about business family and many deeper things that all depend on what you as a fan see For me I don t like when people refer to the show a show about the Mafia For me it s a show about family A family who through generations happen to be apart of the mob Overall this is a masterpiece of a show This is what television should be Right here Complex characters from stunning acting magnificent story lines from brilliant writing and what do you get when you mix these ingredients together A show that defines excellence and dares to be different

I love MIDNIGHT COWBOY and have it in my video collection as it is a favorite of mine What is interesting to me is how when MIDNIGHT COWBOY came out in 1969 it was so shocking to viewers that it was rated X Of course at that time X meant Maturity Since I was only two years old at the time of the movie s release it is hard for me to imagine just how shocked viewers were back then However when I try to take into account that many of the topics covered in the film which included prostitution the title itself was slang for a male prostitute homosexuality loneliness physical and to some extent emotional as well abuse and drugs are hard for many people to talk about to this day I can begin to get a sense of what viewers of this movie thought back on its release It is worth noting that in the 1970 s MIDNIGHT COWBOY was downgraded to an R rating and even though it is still rated R some of the scenes could almost be rated PG 13 by today s standards br br I want to briefly give a synopsis of the plot although it is probably known to almost anyone who has heard of the movie Jon Voight plays a young man named Joe Buck from Texas who decides that he can make it big as a male hustler in New York City escorting rich women He emulates cowboy actors like Roy Rogers by wearing a cowboy outfit thinking that that will impress women After being rejected by all the women he has come across he meets a sleazy con man named Enrico Ratso Rizzo who is played by Dustin Hoffman Ratso convinces Joe that he can make all kinds of money if he has a manager Once again Joe is conned and before long is homeless However Joe comes across Ratso and is invited to stay in a dilapidated apartment Without giving away much more of the plot I want to say that the remainder of the movie deals with Joe and Ratso as they try to help one another in an attempt to fulfill their dreams I E Joe making it as a gigolo and Ratso going down to Florida where he thinks he can regain his health br br I want to make some comments about the movie itself First of all the acting is excellent especially the leads Although the movie is really very sad from the beginning to the end there are some classic scenes In fact there are some scenes that while they are not intended to be funny I find them amusing For example there is the classic scene where Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight are walking down a city street and a cab practically runs them over Dustin Hoffman bangs on the cab and says Hey I m walkin here I m walkin here I get a kick out of that scene because it is so typical of New York City where so many people are in a hurry Another scene that comes to mind is the scene where Ratso Dustin Hoffman sends Joe Jon Voight to a guy named O Daniel What is amusing is that at first we think O Daniel is there to recruit gigolos and can see why Joe is getting so excited but then we begin to realize that O Daniel is nothing but a religious nut In addition to the two scenes I mentioned I love the scene where Ratso and Joe are arguing in their apartment when Ratso says to Joe that his cowboy outfit only attracts homosexuals and Joe says in self defense John Wayne You gonna tell me he s a fag What I like is the delivery in that scene br br I would say that even though MIDNIGHT COWBOY was set in the late 60 s much of it rings true today That s because although the area around 42nd Street in New York has been cleaned up in the form of Disneyfication in the last several years homelessness is still just as prevalent there now as it was 40 years ago Also many people have unrealistic dreams of how they are going to strike it big only to have their dreams smashed as was the case with the Jon Voight character One thing that impresses me about Jon Voight s character is how he is a survivor and I felt that at the end of the movie he had matured a great deal and that Ratso Dustin Hoffman s character was a good influence on him br br In conclusion I want to say that I suggest that when watching this movie one should watch it at least a couple of times because there are so many things that go on For example there are a bunch of flashback and dream sequences that made more sense to me after a couple of viewings Also what I find interesting is that there is a lot in this movie that is left to interpretation such as what really happened with Joe Buck Jon Voight s character and the people who were in his life in Texas Even the ending while I don t want to give it away for those who have not seen the movie is rather open ended
First I would like to say how great this It is astounding and sometimes shocking And to say the least I m 11 years old and this is my favorite movie I can definitely stand a boring film but this is anything but boring It is like a trip through humanity Its stark realism shows through this monumental masterpiece It is a heart wrenching tale of two down and outers VOIGHT AND Hoffman who build a mutual friendship Joe Buck VOIGHT a naive Texan stud comes to New York to make it rich by entertaining women Soon he meets Rico RATSO Rizzo HOFFMAN who is a poor man barely being able to pay rent Ratso becomes Joe s manager but soon both men can t find Joe a job which results in stealing food As they try and survive on the streets of New York we realize how tough it is They can t get Joe a girl until they meet a lady at a party Joe makes some money and soon Joe takes Ratso on a Ratso s dream spot Florida The final five minutes are heart breaking yet some of the greatest moments in the film From MIDNIGHT COWBOY we get a stark and sometimes disturbing urban view on life
I didn t at all think of it this way but my friend said the first thing he thought when he heard the title Midnight Cowboy was a gay porno At that point all I had known of it was the reference made to it in that Seinfeld episode with Jerry trying to get Kramer to Florida on that bus and Kramer s all sick and with a nosebleed br br The movie was great and surprisingly upbeat and not all pissy pretentious pessimistic like some movies I can t even remember because they re all crap br br The plot basically consisted of a naive young cowboy Joe Buck going to New York trying to be a hustler a male prostitute basically thinking it ll be easy pickings only to hit the brick wall hard when a woman ends up hustling HIM charging him for their sexual encounter br br Then he meets Enrico Salvatore Rizzo called Ratso by everyone and the cute gay guys who make fun of him all the time You think of him as a scoundrel but a lovable one like Han Solo or Lando Calrissian and surprisingly he and Joe become friends and the movie is so sweet and heartwarming watching them being friendlier and such and such Rizzo reveals himself to actually be a sad pitiable man who s very sick and very depressed and self conscious hates being called Ratso and wants to go to Florida where he thinks life will be much better and all his problems resolved and he ll learn to be a cook and be famous there br br It s heartwarming watching Joe do all that he does to get them both down to Florida along with many hilarious moments like Ratso trying to steal food at that hippie party and getting caught by the woman who says Gee well you know it s free You don t have to steal it and he says Well if it s free then I ain t stealin it and that classic moment completely unscripted and unscheduled where Hoffman almost gets hit by that Taxi and screams Hey I m walkin here I m walkin here and the acting is so believable you d never believe Joe Buck would grow up to be the distinguished and respected actor Jon Voight and Ratso Rizzo would grow up to be the legendary and beloved Dustin Hoffman It s not the first time they ve worked together in lead roles but the chemistry is so thick and intense br br Then there s the sad part that I believe is quite an overstatement to call it depressing Ratso Rizzo is falling apart all throughout the movie can barely walk barely eat coughs a lot is sick and reaches a head point on the bus on its way to Florida He s hurting badly and only miles away from Miami he finally dies on the bus The bus driver reassures everyone that nothing s wrong and continues on Sad but not in the kind of way that d make you go home and cry and mope around miserably as though you ve just lost your dog of 13 years br br All in all great movie And the soundtrack pretty much consists just of Everybody s Talking played all throughout the movie at appropriate times An odd move but a great one as the song is good and fits in with the tone of the movie perfectly Go see it it s great go buy it
Jon Voight is brilliant in Midnight Cowboy but Hoffman s performance though reminiscent of his later turn in Rainman is the kind of performance that keeps me watching movies As a portrayal of a New York character only Daniel Day Lewis portrayal of Bill Butcher in Gangs of New York comes to mind as comparable and Day doesn t give his character the emotional depth that Hoffman gives Ratso br br It s typical of Hoffman s way of acting that the actor we tend to identify most with Midnight Cowboy is Voight I think Hoffman is one of the 4 or 5 best actors in the history of film at playing off the people around him in such a way that he raises their performances far above their normal levels br br Voight s Buck is so naive that he would float out of the film altogether except that Ratso pulls him down pulls him down but also teaches him a lot about how to survive and more importantly how to live br br Midnight Cowboy is a movie about escape that turns into a movie about finding yourself I think that as gritty a movie as it is it has a very beautiful message that no matter how much a loser you might be Ratso clearly defines loser if you can find a way to be true to yourself you are in possession of the secret of life and you might even be able to share that insight with someone else br br I can t help but compare Midnight Cowboy to Klute from a few years later which I think is more like a movie about finding yourself that turns into a movie about escape
I was going through a list of Oscar winners and was surprised to see that this film beat Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid for best picture in 1969 After actually seeing it however I m not surprised anymore It was way ahead of its time in regards to its style cinematography and use of flashback to help develop Joe Buck s character br br The most amazing thing to me is the depth of Joe Buck s character in such a short movie I think Voight captured the naivete and the viciousness when provoked The two scenes that really caught me were after he gets the blowjob in the theater and when the older man solicits him I think when he looks in the mirror he s trying to see if it s really him that has done or is about to do something terrible br br I think it was a brilliant decision by Hoffman to take this role Otherwise he may have been typecast after the Graduate Anyway this considered an all time great for a reason
Jon Voight plays a man named Joe Joe is shook up by a haunting childhood He has a strong fear and hatred of religion due to his traumatic baptism He quits his job as a dishwasher and goes out to become a hustler for wealthy people He meets a misfit named Ratso Dustin Hoffman and the two for a relationship They go out and work together in helping each other out They become thieves The two grow remarkably close and soon can t live without each other However there is something very important that Ratso hasn t told Joe and it could destroy any hope they have of surviving the city together This is one of the greatest films ever made It is a heartbreaking and shattering portrait of too very lonely men who have nothing to lose but each other Their story is devastating to watch but is ultimately important for people to see It s one of those films where the characters are pretty much just like the seemingly crazy people you sometimes find on the street The difference is that this film is from their perspective Their lives are shown to us and it s devastating to see the pedestrians in this film treat them like dirt especially if we at one time were one of those people However the film doesn t try to guilt trip you Instead it shows you the rough side of the lifestyle of hustling It is not a pleasant and easygoing lifestyle like many Hollywood films portray it such as MILK MONEY and PRETTY WOMAN The lifestyle of being a male hustler is a dirty gritty and ugly life and it s sad that people have degraded themselves like the character of Joe in this film does What startles me the most about this film was that it came out in 1969 and it has stood the test of time perfectly Today s audiences will still find great meaning in this film and will still love it and cherish it just as much as critics and audiences did everywhere in 1969 The film was rated X but what I notice about this film is that the sexuality is portrayed in a much more honest realistic and effective way Anybody who has had sex before will know how humorous awkward and scary as hell it can be and this film doesn t shy away from any of that The sex in this film may not be as graphic as in once was thought to be Movies that were X rated such as MIDNIGHT COWBOY A CLOCKWORK ORANGE GREETINGS LAST TANGO IN Paris and FRITZ THE CAT all seem remarkably tame compared to the shocking things that people can get away with an R rating today The sex scenes in MIDNIGHT COWBOY will seem quite strong but they certainly aren t sexy They are not graphic but they are realistic and that s what people should keep in mind when they view this film The course language that is used in the film particularly the word fag is used effectively and is not gratuitous The violence is very shocking to watch even today but again it is necessary to the plot to depict the world of a hustler I m really glad to see that MIDNIGHT COWBOY is not dated and is still just as affecting as it was in 1969 if not more I can t recommend this classic enough and I do hope that it continues to find an audience because it really is a very special and unforgettable experience that will not soon be forgotten br br PROS br br Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman are both harrowing and amazing to watch They have never played roles like this before or since and they are completely different from usual You ll forget who is playing them within minutes br br Beautiful score br br Not at all dated or campy like many films of that decade come off as today br br Fantastic and fast editing job br br CONS br br For mature audiences only br br The opening scenes are well done but they could be just a little stronger
Although I love this movie I can barely watch it it is so real So I put it on tonight and hid behind my bank of computers I remembered it vividly but just wanted to see if I could find something I hadn t seen before I didn t that s because it s so real to me br br Another user wrote the ages of the commentators should be shown with their summary I m all for that It s absolutely obvious that most of these people who ve made comments about Midnight Cowboy may not have been born when it was released They are mentioning other movies Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman have appeared in at a later time I ll be just as ruinously frank I am 82 years old If you re familiar with some of my other comments you ll be aware that I was a professional female impersonator for 60 of those years and also have appeared in film you d never recognize me even if you were familiar with my night club persona Do you think I know a lot about the characters in this film YOU BET I DO br br and am not the least bit ashamed If you haven t run into some of them it s your loss but there s a huge chance you have but just didn t know it So many moms dads sons and daughters could surprise you It should be no secret MANY actors actresses have emerged from the backgrounds of Midnight Cowboy Who is to judge I can name several current BIG TIME stars who were raised on the seedy streets of many cities and weren t the least bit damaged by their time spent there I make no judgment because these are humans just as we all are love courage kindness compassion intelligence humility you name the attributes they are all there no matter what the package looks like br br The trivia about Hoffman actually begging on the streets to prove he could do the role of Ratzo is a gem he can be seen driving his auto all around Los Angeles how do you think he gets his input I can also name lots of male stars who have stood on the streets and cruised the bars for money Although the nightclub I last worked in for 26 years was world famous and legit I can also name some HUGE stars that had to be constantly chased out our back street looking to make a pick up br br This should be no surprise today although it s definitely action in Hollywood and other cities large and small Wake up and smell the roses They smell no less sweet because they are of a different hue br br Some of the users thought Joe Buck had been molested by his grandma Although I saw him in her bed with a boyfriend I didn t find any incidence of that Believe it or not kids haven t ALWAYS had their own rooms because that is a must today should tell you something kinda kinky may be going on in the master bedroom Whose business Hoffman may have begged for change on the streets but some of the users point out that Jon Voight was not a major star for the filming of Midnight Cowboy his actual salary would surprise you I think he was robbed No one can doubt the clarity he put into his role nor that it MADE him a star for such great work as Deliverance He defined a potent man who had conquered his devils and was the better for it few people commented he had been sodomized in this movie The end of the 60s may have been one of the first films to be so open but society has always been hip br br I also did not find any homosexuality between Ratzo and Joe they were clearly opposites unappealing to one another They found a much purely higher relationship true friendship If you didn t understand that at the end of the movie then you ve wasted your time Joe s bewilderment but unashamed devotion was apparent Yes Voight deserved an Oscar for this role one that John Wayne could never pull off and he was as handsome in his youth br br Hoffman is Hoffman you expect fireworks He gave them superbly Wayne got his Oscar Every character in this film was beautifully defined if you don t think they are still around you are mistaken The party attend some of the raves younger people attend if you can get in Look at the lines of people trying to get into the hot clubs you ll see every outrageous personality br br Brenda Viccaro was the epitome of society s sleek women who have to get down to the nitty gritty at times If you were shocked by her brilliant acting thinking this isn t real look at today s ladies who live on the brink of disrepute and are admired for it br br The brutality Joe displayed in robbing the old guy unfortunately is also a part of life You don t have to condone it but it s not too much different than any violence Joe pointedly named his purpose in that situation I d have handed over the money quicker than he asked for it That s one of the scenes that makes this movie a break through one which I do not watch I get heartbroken for both br br John Schlesinger certainly must have been familiar with this sordidness to direct this chillingly beautiful eye opener Waldo Salt didn t write from clairvoyance Anyone who had any part of getting it to the screen must have realized they were making history and should be proud for the honesty of it Perhaps only in America can we close our eyes to unpleasant situations while other movie makers make no compunction in presenting it to the public Not looking doesn t mean it isn t there give me the truth every time Bravo to all
Acidic unremitting and beautiful John Schlesinger s masterpiece is no less effective today than 35 years ago when American life was even more disorienting The film probably could not have been made at any other time in history because so many upheavals were taking place in the late 1960s final dissolution of the Great American West the intensification of war in Vietnam and the clash of social ideals that were bewildering in variety br br Midnight Cowboy is widely known as the only Academy Award winning film to garner an X rating but there is much more behind its fame it also exceeds the norm as a work of art While this film from the novel by James Leo Herlihy has much to say about the erosion of American life it transcends 60s politics by looking into the hidden bonds of friendship and dealing with themes familiar to man in all eras The two main characters in fact are standard antiheroes men who have nothing grand to offer but plenty to vent about our world br br The initial focus of Midnight Cowboy is on 28 year old Joe Buck a physically imposing Texas native played by Jon Voight In the opening scenes we follow Joe s bus trip to New York City where he plans on using one of his few genuine talents the ability to pleasure women and earn his fortune as a hustler We learn upon his arrival that Joe is laughably na√Øve in the sex trade Garbed in cowboy duds and proclaiming himself as one hell of a stud the young Texan flounders through his early tricks before partnering with Enrico Ratso Rizzo Dustin Hoffman a sickly con man and petty thief from the Bronx Ratso who is short thin and with a limp proves of little monetary help to Joe They quickly run out of cash and as life grows severe in the winter months Joe and Ratso shiver in a condemned Manhattan apartment building with hardly a dollar or square meal to their names It is over this period that a strong friendship develops between them the two men relying on each other to battle tremendous odds br br Throughout the film Joe hearkens back to earlier years in Texas including life with his grandmother Sally Ruth White who served as guardian his harried relationship with Crazy Annie Jennifer Salt a notorious local girl and a traumatic event in which Joe and Annie were assaulted by town folk who wanted to break up the love affair Very much of its time Midnight Cowboy strings together a wild array of flashbacks dream sequences and psychedelic imagery that shed light on the main characters while also distorting their backgrounds For every moment of understanding we gain from Joe and Ratso more questions about their lives are generated Both men are no doubt in tatters they have no clear sense of direction until Ratso falls into the throes of illness and Joe finally senses a purpose for being alive This revelation pushes Midnight Cowboy to its conclusion a rather hopeful one in a very grim story br br While Joe and Ratso badly need some luck the direction of John Schlesinger is clearly outlined and uses the gritty atmosphere of Waldo Salt s screenplay in allowing Voight and Hoffman to thrive Their interactions look extremely natural and the supporting cast which features Sylvia Miles Brenda Vaccaro and members of the Andy Warhol clique offers itself as an essential part of the storyline The flashback sequences involving Voight Ruth White and Jennifer Salt are particularly impressive in dealing with the heartbreak of time lost br br Any young person wondering about the psychedelic era is advised to watch this film thanks to the excellent cinematography of Adam Holender The Boy Who Could Fly Smoke and editing by Hugh Robertson Shaft The visuals of Midnight Cowboy work with its soundtrack assembled by John Barry as a cohesive unit sometimes foreseeing music videos of the past two decades The lead song Everybody s Talking is sung by Nilsson which was actually used as a temporary track during the editing phase The memorable harmonica theme is played by Jean Toots Thielemans br br Midnight Cowboy has been released in a two disc collector s edition by MGM UA which contains expanded features and commentary Also available is a 1998 DVD release used for this review which offers dual widescreen and standard format with 5 1 Dolby Digital sound enhancement three language subtitles and closed captioning French dubbing a theatrical re release trailer not the original as advertised and an eight page production booklet Both DVD editions contain a 25th anniversary restored version of the film showing its original brilliance Well deserving of its three Oscars best picture Schlesinger Waldo Salt and additional nominations Voight Hoffman Sylvia Miles Hugh Robertson Midnight Cowboy will be sure to hold its place on the list of immortal classics br br ¬Ω out of 4
What makes Midnight Cowboy into a successful movie is the way in which Joe Buck becomes bonded to Ratso Rizzo through a series of hardships that affect them both There really aren t many glimpses of hope in this film for either character but the hard realities that beset them both give the film its own type of optimism that these men can at least find humanity within each other br br This film features Jon Voight s finest performance and probably Dustin Hoffman s as well The rest of the cast is made up of unknowns though it is rounded out by a fine series of character actors including the cowpoke on the bus at the start of the film Also for those interested Andy Warhol s apprentice Paul Morrissey shows up briefly during the party scene br br If you haven t seen this movie it is essential Check it out
Midnight Cowboy is one of those films thats been proclaimed a masterpiece with good reason it really is one of the finest films ever made in America Its both artistically valid yet entirely accessible and commercial No wonder it was a huge success when initially released But be warned its also one of the most heartbreaking films ever made The characters are memorable well developed and ultimately tragic The filmmakers should be applauded for not giving us the Hollywood ending something which was basically mandatory by the 80s Still this is why I treasure the years of 1967 to 1977 for American film Its a time when well made innovative and most of all bleak films could be made with the big budgets that Hollywood could offer All this was over by the time Star Wars was released br br The direction by John Schlesinger makes the material work It combines a simplistic style with some experimental editing Unlike many other films featuring these psychedelic effects Midnight Cowboy has aged quite well Its still as powerful now as it was when initially released The acting however is what makes this a masterpiece The characters backgrounds are never fully explained but the performances make them completely developed Both Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman are absolutely memorable and sympathetic despite their sometimes reprehensible actions Plus being a fan of vintage exploitation films I loved the scenes set on the infamously sleazy 42nd street Midnight Cowboy is close to being perfect and one of the most powerful films ever made 10 10
Midnight Cowboy made a big fuss when it was released in 1969 drawing an X rating By today s standards it would be hard pressed to pull an R rating Jon Voight who has been better is competent in his role as Joe Buck an out of town hick wanting to make it big with the ladies in New York City He meets a seedy street hustler named Ratso Rizzo who tries to befriend Buck for his own purposes The two eventually forge a bond that is both touching and pathetic As Ratso Dustin Hoffman simply shines Hoffman has often been brilliant but never more so than in this portrayal He is so into character that all else around him pales in comparison Losing the Academy Award to John Wayne is one of the most ridiculous decisions ever made by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Director Schlessinger has a deft hand with his production but this film has a grungy underbelly that leaves a bad taste in the mouth of the viewer Worth seeing for Hoffman s performance alone
Midnight Cowboy is not for everybody It s raw painful and realistic but very entertaining The lead actors Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman who would go on to become Oscar winning actors deliver amazing performances Voight as the Texas hustler Joe Buck who migrates from small town Texas to New York City to become a hustler He does not apologize for his chosen profession but it is not that easy The New York City women like the rich lady played by Georgeann Johnson and Cass played by Oscar nominated Sylvia Miles are different than Texas women Sadly Buck is trying to escape from his past life in Texas He was raised by his grandmother Sally Buck played by the wonderful actress Ruth White who died in 1969 from cancer The locations in New York City are wonderful to watch as is the relationship between Fatso played by Hoffman and Buck s characters evolve into a moving male to male friendship The men are struggling to survive the New York City life by not playing by the rules like getting a real job As the film evolves Buck s past comes to the surface and it s haunting but not clear The film is not for children but compared to today s films and television programming Midnight Cowboy might be more tame I can t forget a young Brenda Vaccaro and a party that you can t forget It s also a tearjerker of a film so get your hankies out too

John Schlesinger s Midnight Cowboy is perhaps most notable for being the only X rated film in Academy history to receive the Oscar for Best Picture This was certainly how I first came to hear of it and to be completely honest I didn t really expect much of the film This is not to say that I thought it would be horrible but somehow I didn t consider it the sort of movie that I would enjoy watching This is one reason why you should never trust your own instincts on such manners a remarkable combination of stellar acting ambitious directing and a memorable soundtrack Everybody s talking at me I don t hear a word they re sayin make this film one of the finest explorations of life naivety and friendship ever released br br Young Joe Buck then newcomer Jon Voight dressed proudly as a rodeo cowboy travels from Texas to New York to seek a new life as a hustler a male prostitute Women however do not seem to be willing to pay money for his services and Joe faces living in extreme poverty as his supply of money begins to dry up During these exploits Joe comes to meet Enrico Ratso Rizzo Dustin Hoffman a sickly crippled swindler who initially tries to con Joe out of all his money When they come to realise that they are both in the same predicament Ratso offers Joe a place to stay and working together they attempt to make largely dishonest lives for themselves in the cold gritty metropolis of New York br br Joe had convinced himself that New York women would be more than willing to pay for sex however his first such business venture ends with him guiltily paying the woman Sylvia Miles twenty dollars Though he might consider himself to be somewhat intelligent Ratso is just as na√Øve as Joe Ratso with his painful limp and hacking cough is always assuring himself that if only he could travel to the warmth of Miami somehow everything would be all right This misguided expectation that things will get better so easily is quite reminiscent of Lennie and George of John Steinbeck s classic novel Of Mice and Men br br Shot largely on the streets of New York Midnight Cowboy is a grittily realistic look at life in the slums Watching the film we can almost feel ourselves inside Ratso s squalid unheated residence our joints stiff from the aching winter cold The acting certainly contributes to this ultra realism with both Voight and Hoffman masterfully portraying the two decadent dregs of modern society Hoffman in particular is exceptional in his role I m walkin here I m walkin here managing to steer well clear of being typecast after his much lauded debut in 1967 s The Graduate Both stars were later nominated for Best Actor Oscars also nominated for acting bafflingly was Sylvia Miles for an appearance that can t have been for more than five minutes though both ultimately lost out to John Wayne in True Grit Midnight Cowboy eventually went on to win three Oscars from seven nominations including Best Picture Best Director for Schlesinger and Best Writing for Waldo Salt br br Midnight Cowboy is told mainly in a linear fashion though there are numerous flashbacks that hint at Joe s past Rather than explicitly explaining what these brief snippets are actually about the audience is invited to think about it for themselves and how these circumstances could have led Joe onto the path he is now pursuing The achingly beautiful final scene leaves us with a glimmer of hope but a large amount of uncertainty Gritty thought provoking and intensely fascinating Midnight Cowboy is one for the ages
Midnight Cowboy was never a great movie to start with but it is a classic You know it s a classic the moment its insistent theme song Everybody s Talking starts up on the soundtrack actually not written for the film and the way the camera introduces us to Joe Buck naked and in the shower We had seen Jon Voight before but had never really noticed him but when he tells us he s one helluva stud who s to doubt him This was a great performance that had iconic star status as well as a complete grasp of the character and if Voight had never done anything else his performance here would still be legendary As it is Voight has seldom disappointed on screen even a piece of ham as well cured as his performance in that glorious rubbish Anaconda is a source of pleasure br br The film became famous and infamous almost overnight It was a crowd pleaser even with its downbeat ending funny and sexy and recognizably real it was the tail end of the sixties and all the characters rang true It was also the first X rated film to win the Oscar as the year s Best Picture Adapted brilliantly by Waldo Salt from a James Leo Herlihy novel it was probably the first main stream commercial American movie to deal with taboo subjects such as homosexuality and drug taking in a matter of fact manner Everyone is recognizably human warts and all and everyone is treated sympathetically Voight s Joe Buck is an innocent abroad a Candide who comes to New York to seek his fortune as a hustler a profession he sees as glamorous and not seedy he s a cross between a gigolo and a social worker But when he himself is hustled by a scraggy wormy little con man called Ratso Rizzo Dustin Hoffman fresh from The Graduate and he s a revelation he realizes that perhaps the reality is a little different from the pipe dream br br Essentially it s a male love story though totally platonic between these two not so unlikely bedfellows Both totally alone both totally needy each becomes the protector of the other Voight with his physical prowess Hoffman with his street wise savvy They are misfits adrift from the mainstream tolerant of their own peculiarities and the deviances of others Though straight Voight isn t beyond a homosexual encounter in a 42nd street cinema with a boy even lonelier than himself The whole film posits a strangely Christian attitude br br It s also magnificently acted While Voight and Hoffman hold the screen throughout there are superb vignettes from the likes of Brenda Vaccaro and Sylvia Miles as well as John McGiver Bob Balaban and Bernard Hughes as sundry customers and hangers on beautifully delineated little character studies that seem to transcend acting altogether while John Schlesinger s direction gives the film the feel of a documentary as well as an alien s totally detached eye view of the American under belly without rancor and without criticism On second thoughts maybe it is a great movie after all
Just kidding br br Seeking greener pastures in the form of hustling in New York City Jon Voight is young optimist Cowboy almost Forest Gump like Joe Buck from Texas It does not take long for the Big Apple to mercilessly swallow him and his ambitions whole and very soon Joe is the target of both the coldness of New Yorkers and cons from its street thugs Given his pure heart he takes pity on one of these thugs Ratso Rizzo Dustin Hoffman and later moves in with him in his wreck of apartment and the two literally struggle to survive br br While Midnight Comedy is labeled as a drama it is best described as either a tragic comedy or a comedic tragedy in my opinion It is above all a beautiful film that is stylish in capturing the contemporary hippie vibe of the late 1960s with its mandatory dizzying Warhol party cinematography and juxtaposing it with ultra urban New York City The film crams Cowboy Joe Buck somewhere in between thereby emphasizing his out of place position We feel for his struggle to fit in but also to merely get enough money to feed Ratso Rizzo br br Midnight Cowboy brought tears to my eyes as it is also rich in substance and projects a lot of heart I imagine this film must have inspired both Forest Gump with its pure hearted and out of place lead character and to an extent the Crocodile Dundee films as it deals with almost the exact same kind of humour a contrast between country cowboys and slick New York cosmopolitans Very compelling and sensationally creative film that I highly recommend br br 8 5 10
Saw this as a young naive punk when it was first released Had me snifflin like a baby as I left the theatre trying not to let anyone see So when I saw it again now in 07 I knew what to expect the sobs were ready primed as their required moment approached Thankfully this time I was at home br br What I hadn t remembered from my youthful viewing or perhaps hadn t noticed because of it was the technical brilliance of this movie The use of flashbacks which tell so much story without resorting to dialogue The camera work which seemed to place the viewer together with the characters in the scene Think of the opening when Joe is crossing the street to the diner the camera pans behind the woman child sitting on a bench in the foreground framing the street scene br br The story itself the characters seedy sad brutally real It is very touching to be drawn so closely into a human drama such as this with people most of us would likely spurn Then again Joe Ratso could be any of us Must have been 70 when I saw it I recall that upon leaving the theatre I was impelled to find the company of friends All these years later I m glad I m not alone tonight This is one hell of a great movie
Midnight Cowboy opens with a run down Drive In theater with the voice over of the main character Joe Buck Jon Voight singing in the shower He is singing a cowboy song the very thing he strives to be Joe picks up his humdrum life living in Texas and moves it to New York City with the dream of lots of women and even more money He dresses as the epitome of the cowboy but in a cartoonish fashion not even his friends take him seriously He begins his journey on the bus to NYC and we can quickly see how diluted Joe is through his interactions with the other passengers This is primarily a story of Joe s realization of the harsh realities of the real world br br He starts off as a very na√Øve southerner thinking he can make it in NYC just on his good looks He has no other reason to think otherwise as they proved helpful in the past we learn this from the many flashbacks he has In the beginning the flashbacks are filmed in a way that portrays them as being somewhat whimsical They are hazy and the voices sound as if they are coming from a great distance as they are they are coming out of his past However as Joe delves deeper and deeper into the reality of the harsh atmosphere of NYC we see more of his past which is no longer whimsical but gritty filmed in black and white with rapid editing to portray the cruel nature of the past events This is especially seen in the flashback of him and his girlfriend being assaulted and her being raped In one of these flashbacks we see a building being torn down brick by brick This mirrors the way in which Joe himself is falling apart the naivet√© that he once carried is falling off of him He and Ratso Dustin Hoffman are living in squalor and barely able to get food to eat Joe is realizing he cannot live off of his looks that there is a gritty underbelly of New York that he didn t envision His subconscious mirrors the way in which his real life is panning out br br Ratso is also serves as a kind of mirror to Joe but in an opposite way Ratso is Joe s foil Joe is a handsome strong man who for the most part has a good outward appearance Ratso on the other hand from the very first time we see him sitting next to Joe in the bar we can tell he is the opposite He is short dark and always coated with a sheen of sweat He understands how the world works that it is unforgiving and sometimes no matter how hard you try you will fail just as his father did They are living in the same world the same apartment even but they understand things on a completely different level br br The theme of alienation one that is common of this era is very apparent in this film Neither Joe nor Ratso fit into the culture surrounding them Joe feels trapped in Texas and moves to NYC where he is still very much an outsider Ratso living in the cold of NYC wishes to move to sunny Florida where he thinks he will be able to find a good life Even though this is his ideal in the fantasy we get from Ratso s perspective it is apparent that he knows he will never really fit into society In said fantasy he is turned on by the people living around him he is yet again an outsider alienated from society br br It is not until the end that the gap between Joe and Ratso begins to narrow Joe resorts to violence he takes on the mentality of this city in order to get money to fund a means of escape for Florida for himself and Ratso On the journey we see Joe coming out of a store not wearing the cowboy clothes that he is never without in the rest of the film He is dressed as someone who looks like they are headed to Florida for vacation He dresses Ratso the same way he tires to make them fit into the new society they are entering but it is to no avail Upon Ratso s death on the bus their fellow passengers once again look them upon as outsiders Even in this new culture they have entered they cannot escape the alienation they have met at every turn in this film Despite the Ratso s death and Joe s continued alienation the film ends with the hope that Joe can take his new knowledge of how the world works and create a better life than he would have had as a hustler in NYC Midnight Cowboy is an excellent film portraying the harsh reality of society and alienation with stellar performances by both Voight and Hoffman
After Racism Rural exodus also known as migration from the country side is another socio political issue of the 1960s WestSide Story had dealt with Racism by a love feast in an artistic view Now Midnight Cowboy deals with rural exodus by a friendship tragedy in a psychological view It has a deeply grievous ending that we witness one of the two companions of fate passing away br br Director John Schlesinger skillfully deliver us the deepest secret thoughts dreams fantasies fears and evaluations of two New York City scums While the handsome Joe Buck Voight dreams of all the beautiful women of the world begging him to share a wild love fantasy the poor Ratso Rizzo Hoffman dreams of a better and healthier life in clean and sunny Florida Accordingly Joe becomes a hustler to turn his fantasies into reality and Ratso becomes a snatcher to collect enough money to migrate into Florida Besides Ratso helps Joe to find his way to do whatever he can They begin sharing everything in life They share food they share medicine they share an uninhabited home they share their earnings and thus they share a destiny Regrettably as the story progresses Joe realizes that being handsome is not the only thing to make all the beautiful women begging him to have fun and moreover Ratso cannot see Florida since his heart fails defeated to his disease whilst he was on the bus taking him there br br The Might is always right and the Feeble has no right in the daylight Thence Midnight gives the factual sight br br Despite the tragedy there is no melodrama in Midnight Cowboy Every aspect of each character is the reality of the poor who bear their inevitable fate Thanks to this Midnight Cowboy is a provocative view of a socio political issue the rural exodus
Fascinating downer about a would be male hustler in New York City forced to live in a condemned building with a crippled con man Extremely bleak examination of modern day moral and social decline extremely well directed by John Schlesinger who never topped his work here and superbly acted by Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman Packs quite a punch overall yet the fantasy scenes some of which are played for a chuckle are mildly intrusive as is the mod drug party The relationship that develops between the two men is sentimental yet the filmmakers are careful not to get mushy and this gives the picture an edge it might not have had with a lesser director than Schlesinger Originally X rated in 1969 and the winner of the Best Picture Oscar screenwriter Waldo Salt who adapted James Leo Herilhy s book and Schlesinger also won statues 1 2 from
It s not quite the timeless masterpiece you would hope it would be based on the acclaim it garnered but 1969 s Midnight Cowboy is still a powerhouse showcase for two young actors just bursting into view at the time Directed by John Schlesinger and written by Waldo Salt the movie seems to be a product of its time the late 1960 s when American films were especially expressionistic but it still casts a spell because the story comes down to themes of loneliness and bonding that resonate no matter what period The film s cinematic influence can still be felt in the unspoken emotionalism found in Ang Lee s Brokeback Mountain br br The meandering plot follows Joe Buck a naive young Texan who decides to move to Manhattan to become a stud for hire for rich women Full of energy but lacking any savvy he fails miserably but is unwilling to concede defeat despite his dwindling finances He meets a cynical sickly petty thief named Ratso Rizzo who first sees Joe as an easy pawn The two become dependent on one another and Rizzo begins to manage Joe Things come to a head at a psychedelic drug infested party where Joe finally lands a paying client Meanwhile Rizzo becomes sicker and the two set off for Florida to seek a better life This is not a story that will appeal to everyone in fact some may still find it repellent that a hustler and a thief are turned into sympathetic figures yet their predicaments feel achingly authentic br br In his first major role Jon Voight is ideally cast as he brings out Joe s paper thin bravado and deepening sexual insecurities As Rizzo Dustin Hoffman successfully upends his clean post college image from The Graduate and immerses himself in the personal degradation and glimmering hope that act as an oddly compatible counterpoint to Joe The honesty of their portrayals is complemented by Schlesinger s film treatment which vividly captures the squalor of the Times Square district at the time The director also effectively inserts montages of flashbacks and fantasy sequences to fill in the character s fragile psyches Credit also needs to go to Salt for not letting the pervasive cynicism overwhelm the pathos of the story The other performances are merely incidental to the journeys of the main characters including Brenda Vaccaro as the woman Joe meets at the party Sylvia Miles as a blowsy matron John McGiver as a religious zealot and Barnard Hughes as a lonely out of towner br br The two disc 2006 DVD package contains a pristine print transfer of the 1994 restoration and informative commentary from producer Jerome Hellman since unfortunately neither Schlesinger nor Salt are still living There are three terrific featurettes on the second disc a look back documentary After Midnight Reflections on a Classic 35 Years Later which features comments from Hellman Hoffman Voight and others as well as clips and related archive footage such as Voight s screen test Controversy and Acclaim which examines the genesis of the movie s initial X rating and public response to the film and a tribute to the director Celebrating Schlesinger
Midnight Cowboy was rated X with the original release back in 1969 There are some scenes where you can understand that just a little The movie about Joe Buck Jon Voight coming from Texas to New York City to become a hustler is sometimes a little disturbing Dressed up as a cowboy he tries to live as a hustler making money by the act of love It does not work out as he planned After a guy named Rico Ratso Rizzo Dustin Hoffman first pulled a trick on him and stole some money they become friends They live in an empty and very filthy apartment Then Ratso gets sick and Joe has to try to make some money br br The movie was probably rated X for the main subject but on the way we see some strange things The editing in this movie is great We see dream sequences from Joe and Ratso interrupted by the real world in a nice and sometimes funny way Dustin Hoffman Jon Voight and the supporting actors give great performances Especially Hoffman delivers some fine famous lines The score is done by John Barry and sounds great All this makes this a great movie that won the Best Picture Oscar for a good reason
Joe Buck Jon Voight decides he s going to leave his small life in Texas and make it big in the Big City The women are there for the asking and the men are mainly tutti fruttis Wide eyed he comes to New York City not prepared for the series of humiliating misadventures he experiences one worse than the other In the middle of that chaos he meets and befriends Rico Ratso Rizzo Dustin Hoffmann a homeless looking man who lives in an apparently condemned building br br There isn t much of a story as MIDNIGHT COWBOY is a series of vignettes destined to bring forth not only Joe Buck s plights in the City but also inter cut to his past and show us in shock cuts and semi psychedelic dream sequences snippets of his past his failed relationship with his girlfriend Annie Jennifer Salt who was gang raped his abandonment by his mother and his apparent abuse by his grandmother who also had a habit of hustling men for money An air of pessimism dominates the film almost from the wistful beginning as Nilsson plays throughout the opening credits his deceptively flowery Everybody s Talking we feel that even while we want Joe to eventually make his mark in the City the odds are high he won t and will end up working for pennies in a dead end job shown in a masterful shot from his outside point of view later in the film as he watches a man work as a dishwasher in a soup kitchen through a window and sees himself We know from the look in his eyes he does not want to end like this br br A dark story of dashed hopes John Schlesinger creates haunting images of lost souls at the end of the 60s and at the center the prevailing friendship between two men as they struggle to make some sort of meaning to their lives amidst the elusive comfort of a dignified life There is the implied notion that they may have been lovers Ratso s reaching out to hug Joe in the party scene and their the final embrace at the end certainly points at this but this is essentially a buddy film one that manages to survive literally to the death and bring some form of hope to Joe who at the end in Florida seems much changed older wiser
I sat down to watch Midnight Cowboy thinking it would be another overrated 60s 70s movie Some of my favorite films come from the 70s in the same vein as Midnight Cowboy Taxi Driver Mean Streets Panic in Needle Park etc but there are many many overrated ones as well that have gained strong reputations amongst critics for being groundbreaking unfortunately a vast majority of them don t hold up as well today I sort of feel this way about Easy Rider Although it too is one of my favorites br br So I didn t expect much from Midnight Cowboy but got a lot back It s a touching story well made and well told with some of the best performances of all time Dustin Hoffman as Enrico Ratso Rizzo gives one of his best it s a bit funny at times he sounds like a cartoon character when he speaks maybe because of the Lenny Simpsons connection but Hoffman is entirely convincing Half of the film s budget went towards his paycheck as he was just becoming a major star in Hollywood Opposite him is the second billed Jon Voight as Joe Buck the cowboy who travels North to the Big Apple in the hopes of becoming a male prostitute Soon his naive ways land him in trouble and he pairs up with a crippled scam artist named Ratso who offers to become Joe s manager for a certain percentage of profits br br The movie is quite long at two hours but never really seems very long Some films can tend to drag especially some of the films that were made in the 70s because as it s been said in Easy Riders Raging Bulls the directors were the stars of the movies in the 1970s and occasionally they got a bit too infatuated with their material going on too long examining characters scenes etc that aren t important Just about the only scene I felt was a bit too long and unnecessary was the drug party it makes the film seem extremely outdated similar to the drug odysseys in Easy Rider and really harms its flow because it s not needed br br Other than that Midnight Cowboy is an almost flawless motion picture I was pleasantly surprised It does have its flaws flashbacks are a bit tacky and never used as well as they could have been for instance and some of the scenes are a bit uneasy such as the gay movie theater sequence but if you can handle its content Midnight Cowboy is a truly great motion picture an uncompromising examination of life on the streets in the late 60s early 70s It s a depressing movie yes and by today s standards might seem a bit outdated and heavy on the liberal perspective of life is horrible etc but I still love it and particularly the extremely touching ending will stay with me for a long long time br br Highly recommended One of the best films of the 70s It was technically released in late 1969 but I d still categorize it as a 1970s film It also won the Best Picture Oscar being the first and only X rated motion picture to do so It was later re rated R on appeal br br 4 5 5
The only reason I knew of Midnight Cowboy was because it was in the AFI Critic s Top 100 For a top 100 it is not a very well known movie indeed I had to look hard to find a copy I got the DVD version for about half price Surprisingly it was only rated M15 the uncut version br br I doubt many will take notice of this review more like comment so I ll make it brief br br This is perhaps one of the strangest movies I ve seen partly because of the use of montages artistic filming very art house and the unusual theme There are many things in the film I still don t understand I ve seen it twice and it makes for an emotionally confusing film br br The filming and acting were very good and it is the larger than life characters which make this film memorable The main character is Joe Buck a cowboy from Texas who moves to New York to become a male prostitute He meets the crippled conman Enrico Ratso Rizzo and of course they become friends going through the usual escapades What makes the film interesting is the two characters are so different br br I felt the film didn t really develop the relationship between Buck and Enrico Rizzo for the audience to have any real emotional connection although the ending is certainly quite sad and tragic You probably already know what happens by reading the reviews but its pretty obvious from the start br br I personally think the film beautifully and poignantly explores its main themes The deprivation of humanity shown by the darkness of the city streets the breaking down tenements Most of the characters in the film exist beyond the law a conman giggolo etc yet you can t help liking them Joe Buck is endearing because he is so naive and optimistic while we begin to feel pity for Ratso later in the film br br I think the film was rated so high because it was certainly very ground breaking for its period At the time And even now it was definitely not a typical movie quite art house At a time when the cinema was dominated by tired westerns musicals and dramas a film with such an unusual theme as Midnight Cowboy pops up br br On a personal level I must say I quite liked the film The imagery conveyed a dream like quality I particularly liked the scene at the party the music images etc stay in your mind for a long time after watching However as a movie for entertainment s sake it was a bit lacking not really my style of movie in thrills This is a film to be savoured and appreciated rather than a cheap thrills action flick br br Although I would hardly consider myself qualified to analyse this film the characters and their motives were quite interesting From what I understand from the flashbacks Joe Buck was sexually abused as a child by his grandmother although it still doesn t seem to be relevant to the story He is a happy go lucky young stud who suppresses his darker memories The religious connotations in the film are also puzzling Some have suggested a homosexual connection between Buck and Ratso although I fail to see where they have got the idea from The theme of homo sexuality in general is more than touched upon in their conversation and later in Joe Buck s encounter with a lonely old man but it has little to do with the main story br br Certainly from a technical point of view one of the finest films of the decade it has more of a 70s feel to it than a 60s feel and revolutionary for its time touching on subjects few other films dared to do While it has a simple sentimental story to it disguised by a hard edge the beauty of the film is in the strange often psychedelic sequences
Watching Midnight Cowboy is like taking a masterclass in acting directing cinematography editing writing I was too young to watch it when it was originally released and only saw it for the first time a couple of years ago but it has absolutely stood the test of time and I have watched it several times since br br Everything about this film is brilliant from the poignant performances from Voight and Hoffman even though I know this movie well I still find myself welling up every time Voight flashes one of his innocently pained looks or Hoffman coughs in his sickly and ominous way to the stunning cinematography and superbly edited dream sequences br br It s a shame that more of our contemporary filmmakers aren t prepared to take a risk on making movies that are as visually and aurally interesting as this one Midnight cowboy should be required viewing at all film schools br br 10 10
Virile but naive big Joe Buck leaves his home in Big Spring Texas and hustles off to the Big Apple in search of women and big bucks In NYC JB meets up with frustration and with Ratso Rizzo a scruffy but cordial con artist Somehow this mismatched pair manage to survive each other which in turn helps both of them cope with a gritty sometimes brutal urban America en route to a poignant ending br br Both funny and depressing our Midnight Cowboy rides head on into the vortex of cyclonic cultural change and thus confirms to 1969 viewers that they themselves have been swept away from the 1950 s age of innocence and dropped Dorothy and Toto like into the 1960 s Age of Aquarius br br The film s direction is masterful the casting is perfect the acting is top notch the script is crisp and cogent the cinematography is engaging and the music enhances all of the above Deservedly it won the best picture Oscar of 1969 and I would vote it as one of the best films of that cyclonic decade
In my opinion this is one of the greatest movies ever made in America and it deserved every single award it won and it s place on the AFI Top 100 list though it s shamefully too low on the IMDB Top 250 list at only 183 as of this writing If you enjoy acting of the highest calibre Voight and Hoffman are a superb match well drawn characterizations and inventive direction editing and cinematography you ll love this just as much as I did Schlesinger paints a vivid always credible picture of the late 60s New York City scene and it s many victims struggling to overcome personal demons and survive amidst the amorality poverty and hopelessness of 42nd Street New York City br br The filmmaking techniques employed here brilliantly capture the feel of the underground New York film movement and of the city and are nothing less than dazzling I ve seen many ideas including the rapid fire editing the handling of the voice over flashbacks the drug trip sequences and the cartoonish face slipped in during a murder scene to convey angst and terror stolen by other filmmakers br br The relationship between Joe and Ratso is handled in such a way as to be viewed as an unusually strong friendship OR having it s homosexual underpinnings I think the director handled this in a subtle way not to cop out to the censorship of the times but rather to concentrate his energies on the importance of a strong human connection in life whether it be sexual or not br br MIDNIGHT COWBOY is a brave moving film of magnitude influence and importance that has lost absolutely none of it s impact over the years so if you haven t seen it you re really missing out on a true American classic I recommend this film to everyone br br Score 10 out of 10
Young handsome muscular Joe Buck Jon Voight moves from Texas to New York thinking he ll make a living by being a stud He gets there and finds out quickly that it isn t going to be easy he goes through one degrading experience after another At the end of his rope he hooks up with crippled sleazy Ratso Rizzo Dustin Hoffman Together they try to survive and get out of the city and move to Florida But will they make it br br Very dark disturbing yet fascinating movie Director John Schelsinger paints a very grimy portrait of NYC and its inhabitants In that way it s dated the city may have been this bad in 1969 but it s cleaned up considerably by now He also uses every camera trick in the book color turning to black white trippy dream sequences flash forwards flash backs especially involving a rape shock cuts weird sound effects you name it It keeps you disoriented and off center but I couldn t stop watching br br There isn t much of a story it basically centers on the friendship between Rizzo and Buck There is an implication that they may have been lovers the final shot sort of shows that It s just a portrait of two damaged characters trying to survive in a cold cruel urban jungle br br This was originally rated X in 1969 the only reason being that the MPAA didn t think that parents would want their children to see this Nevertheless it was a big hit with high schoolers back then X meant no one under 17 It also has been the only X rated film ever to win an Academy Award as Best Picture Hoffman and Voight were up for acting awards as was mysteriously Sylvia Miles who was in the picture for a total of maybe 5 minutes It was eventually lowered to an R with no cuts when it was reissued in 1980 br br Also the excellent song Everybody s Talkin was introduced in this film and became a big hit br br A great film but very dark I m giving it a 10 DON T see it on commercial TV it s cut to ribbons and incomprehensible
I typically don t like reality shows particularly the ones that are profiting off of American Idol s success But this one I can live with br br Comedians from all around the world perform a brief routine for celebrity talent scouts and if they like them those guys will be sent to perform a routine for an actual audience Then ten or twelve comics are selected to live in a house together and do Survivor style competitions using comedic tactics Then one will be determined as Last Comic Standing I do like stand up comedy so this is the one reality show must keen to my interests There are usually some pretty funny comics selected through It started the careers of such talents as Alonzo Bodden Ralphie May and Josh Blue br br My negative criticisms is the fact that there is the possibility that a lot of these comics were selected for their contribution to reality show drama At first they lived together in a house like Big Brother but now they ve done away with that thank God br br And there are a lot of comedians I felt were only chosen not because they re funny but because of race ethnicity attitude sex etc when other comics clearly should ve beaten them out But overall it s a well made reality show which are two terms up until now I thought were an oxymoron
Horror is perhaps one of two genres where logic doesn t always win out over imagination We all know that killers like Freddy Jason Michael and even Leatherface shouldn t be able to sustain the amount of pain they do and still live to fight another day Most of us don t believe that zombies really rise from the dead to stalk people and eat their brains And let s hope that at least some people know that when you enter places like Funhouses and old mansions that unspeakable crimes are not going to be perpetrated against them This is where imagination wins out over fact Horror and most films in general requires us to suspend our disbelief for a couple of hours and just go with the flow This usually isn t a problem when I watch bouncing balls being hurled down the stairs at George C Scott or when I see an unseen force stalking three amateur film makers in the woods near Burketsville But what I do have a problem digesting without wanting to regurgitate is when a film has a killer like the one in this film To give away who the killer is would actually be a huge spoiler and it would take away all fun of watching it for yourself but just suffice to say that I actually enjoyed this film right up to final scene when the killer is revealed There are too many events in the film that transpire for it to make any sense that the killer is who it is But the 90 minutes prior to this point is a well done suspenseful blood soaked film directed with panache and skill by John Hough If the film would have offered me a different killer then I would actually be raving about it This may sound like a completely asinine reason to discredit the film but believe me anyone who has seen the film is almost sure to agree with me br br John Cassevetes plays Dr Sam Cordell He and his daughter Jenny played beautifully by Erin Flannery have just recently moved to this small New England town Cordell is a recent widow and it is unclear how his wife died We see several flashback scenes where a mystery woman one can only presume it is his wife is laying backside on the ground during a torrential downpour Her face is bloodied and her eyes are closed Again I am not sure who this woman is and what relevance she has to the story but she is there anyway Cassevetes it has to be mentioned is strange to say the least Cordell is a loving father but his love for his daughter seems to be a little more than just parental There are a few scenes that hint of incestuous possibilities It never comes to fruition but it just seems to be omnipotent but somewhere just beneath the proverbial rug Thankfully the film never really explores this element of the relationship but it does make you a little uneasy br br Casevettes seems like a cross between the porno actor John Leslie and screen great James Caan He has a deceptive smile and a virile commanding voice that makes you sit up and take notice But he also looks like he is about to disrobe during a business luncheon in every scene He just has that slimy disingenuous phlegmatic uneasy way about him He never really looks like he can be trusted in this film I guess that is a credit to the writers the director and to Cassevetes himself There was always something that just bothered me about his character from the get go br br The story begins on an excellent note as two would be lovers are swimming in the local quarry There is a rickety old changing shed near by and as we can see something or someone is watching them When the young man briefly disappears to get something from the truck the young woman wanders into the shed just to play a prank Once she is there she is attacked The young man dashes to the shed to find her and he is impaled with a board and nail Hough shrewdly sets us up for the payoff pitch when the young man comes in He looks frantically scours the room and spots his would be lover bleeding in the corner and then smacko the guy gets it It is a very tense moment and it starts the film off on the correct note br br Also introduced into the tangled wed of a story is a young man named Tim that seems to be having strange dreams of a faceless woman that is bound in a torture chamber surrounded by men with cloaks covering their faces Tim seems to think that his dreams have something to do with the murders because every time a murder takes place he has another dream Toss in a quiet and turbid grandmother a meretricious female reporter and a strong yet venal local sheriff and you have all the ingredients necessary to create the makings of an imbroglio in the small town of Galen br br Throughout the film more people are massacred but most of the time the males are slaughtered with extreme prejudice and the females are raped This is my first feeble and careful attempt to tell you that this is what left me unconvinced with the denouement It just didn t strike the right chord br br The Incubus is a well done film It is tense tight and even most of the performances are very well done I was intrigued by the dreams that Tim was having and I was anxious to find out what significance they had to the story and ultimately to the murders But when you get through all that was good in the film you are still left with that acerbic taste in your mouth And bitter pills are always more difficult to swallow than sweet ones br br 7 out of 10 This could have been a nine Too bad
Shocking well made chiller is an undervalued tale of atrocious murder and evil forces br br Small town doctor tries to discover who or what is committing a series of violent sexual murders br br Incubus is a tight mystery with some horrific murder sequences that builds to an off beat and eerie climatic twist The murder scenes are intense and gory so this isn t a film for the squeamish The direction of John Hough along with a bizarre music score combine to create a dark atmosphere of dread that runs through out the film It also carries a kind of Gothic vibe as well Nice filming locations and some stylish camera work also highlight br br The cast isn t bad either The great John Cassavetes does a solid performance as the new doctor in town Also good are the performances of Kerrie Keane as the local reporter Helen Hughes as the town historian and Duncan McIntosh as a tormented psychic teen br br All around Incubus is a forgotten horror film that needs to be re discovered and re evaluated br br out of
This is a wonderful film First impressions of cynicism and crassness are soon dissipated by a fun loving display of how men and women s baser motivations diverge Vive la difference br br You can love people despite and sometimes because of their weaknesses Human beings are a bit rubbish really but we have big hearts and we try our best despite temptation It s not our fault when sometimes temptation can t be resisted that s just who we are br br There is a consistent stylishness from start to finish crisp photography and sharp composition very pleasant viewing when you add provocative content well suited music and laugh out loud scripting br br Watch out for the very young lone wise voice brilliant wisdom from innocence balancing comedy from the human condition
This is truly the greatest Swedish movie of all time Not only is it revolutionary in its narration but its also among the first movies to feature the next generation of Swedish humor and Swedish comedians Felix Herngren and Fredrik Lindstr√∂m are two of the most intelligent and witty filmmakers in Sweden today and this film really puts that on display br br Vuxna m√§nniskor Adult People is a warm hearted and hilarious story about adulthood and the question if we wouldn t be better off without it
This is a very funny movie I have no idea whether it translates well into other languages or not However I do think men all over the world can identify with Frank and his thoughts to some extent These thoughts are hugely entertaining and women will also enjoy this movie I m sure br br All cast members perform well and this film could have been a tremendous hit all over the world if it was made in England or the US But for those of you who are fortunate enough to understand Swedish you are in for a treat br br Highly recommended
High energy Raoul Walsh classic from 1933 The Bowery places saloon owner and operator Wallace Beery against bitter rival and dandy George Raft with adopted street kid Jackie Cooper and good looking Faye Wray in roles that play in between their big rivalry It s not clear exactly what the rivalry is all about but everyone follows it in the daily tabloids Plenty of wisecracks at the beginning but the characters soften up as the film progresses Apart from that is the sheer exuberance of the scenes in Beery s saloon The various characters sexy chorus line lots of drinking a perfect creation of a den of iniquity not too refrained by so called pre code restrictions and then later come the Carrie Nations led by Carrie Nation herself It all creates a very vivid picture of a life that s long gone I don t like to compare eras but this film is completely and totally different from anything one would see today The film has plenty of heart and long lost innocence and is absolutlely a must see
I love this freekin movie Walsh is a true master of the cinematic form his film have been sometimes in my opinion overlooked But this film is a favourite of mine because it really gives you the feel of the time the film was set in br br All the wonderful characters that existed the lifestyle the mode of dress the way they spoke OK they might be exaggerated but it is good to know that there were occasion when two men tried to outdo each other with insane stunts br br I just felt it was apiece of history thats should be wathced by many people and appreciated because of that fact br br Can I get it somewhere on DVD I have only seen it on TV But for anyone wanting a slice of life movie about that period of time this is the perfect one
In Brooklyn a century ago the rivalry between Chuck Connors and Steve Brodie and their competing volunteer fire brigades leads to Brodie s famous bet that he can jump off the Brooklyn Bridge This is a story which will be familiar to a lot of people through a Bugs Bunny spoof Bowery Bugs from 1949 br br This generally very enjoyable film would probably be more widely available if it were not for the notorious and unsettling scene involving some Chinese tenement dwellers a time capsule of antediluvian racial attitudes giving the film a great deal of historical interest in my view
Four words account for why this film was made She Done Him Wrong The huge commercial success of that Mae West vehicle convinced the studio brass that Gay 90s melodramas were a viable proposition Here we are rewarded with a fast moving well written romp which neatly targets the personalities of its stars br br Wallace Beery and George Raft are excellent as friendly rivals Jackie Cooper is a little harder to take but it is Fay Wray who steals the film with her stock in trade damsel in distress With a strong director as Walsh proves himself to be Wray could carry a lot of punch and she is utterly believable as the object of both Raft and Beery s affection br br Lots of atmosphere beautifully designed this is a forgotten film worthy of revival
George Raft as Steve Brodie the carefree dancing gambler who can never refuse a dare is pitted against the lumbering sentimental Chuck Connors Wallace Beery A soft touch for every panhandler Connors impulsively adopts waifs and strays notably runaway orphan Swipes Jackie Cooper complete with kittens and the homeless Lucy Calhoun an out of town innocent with ambitions to become a writer br br In this male dominated culture communication takes place mostly in the form of violence one sees why THE BOWERY is a Martin Scorsese favorite Exploding cigars provide a running gag Swipes enjoys throwing rocks through windows in Chinatown on one occasion setting a laundry alight The simultaneous arrival of both Brodie s and Beery s volunteer fire companies leads to a brawl during which the building burns to the ground Beery casually saps a troublesome girl and thumps anyone who disagrees with him including Brodie whom he defeats in a night time fist fight on a moored barge to regain control of his saloon lost on a bet that Brodie wouldn t have the courage to jump off the Brooklyn Bridge Brodie does make the leap but only because a subterfuge with a dummy fails at the last moment br br As usual Walsh fills the frame with detail illustrating with relish the daily life of the tenderloin singing waiters bullying barmen whores from Suicide Hall being hustled into the Black Maria tailors collaring hapless hicks off the street and forcing them to buy suits they don t want A minor but admirable little film
A favourite of mine this movie tells of two feuding New York characters Steve Brodie Raft and Chuck Connors Beery who both strive to be the Main Guy in the Bowery in the late Nineteenth Century br br Brodie 1863 1901 and Connors 1852 1913 were real people though this is a heavily fictionalized account of their antics based on a play Brodie s legendary did he do it it s still a cause of argument jump from the Brooklyn bridge 1886 for which he became famous is shown here as happening around the same time as the Spanish American war 1898 Director Walsh clearly had a great affection for the period so beautifully recreated here and it includes a wild rumbustious ragtime number from saloon singer Trixie Odbray a young Pert Kelton Raft is at his slickest as Brodie and Beery shows again what a clever actor he was as tough big hearted and at times quite touching Connors Pretty Fay Wray is the love interest both the boys are pursuing br br Full of life and energy The Bowery moves at a fast pace unlike many early talkies It is not an easy movie to find but is well worth looking out for
Culled from the real life exploits of Chuck Connors and Steve Brodie in 1890s New York The Bowery is high energy and good natured br br But be warned Casual racial epithets flow off the tongues of Wallace Beery and little Jackie Cooper The very first shot might be startling This is true to the time it was set and the time it was made And it also speaks to the diversity of population in that neck of the woods It certainly adds to the gritty flavor of the atmosphere br br Beery as Connors is the blustering thunder at the center of the action a loud mouth saloon keeper with his own fire brigade And he has a soft spot for ornery orphan Cooper Raft as Brodie is Connors slicker better looking rival in almost every endeavor Brodie could never turn down a dare and loved attention leading up to a jump off the Brooklyn Bridge it is still debated whether he actually jumped or used a dummy br br Beery is as bombastic as ever with a put on Irish American accent He is just the gruff sort of character to draw children cats and ladies in distress This is possibly the most boisterous character Raft ever played and he even gets to throw in a little dancing as well as a show of leg And again he mistakes the leading lady lovely Fay Wray for a prostitute Cooper is as tough as either of them though he gets a chance to turn on the tears br br The highlight isn t the jump off the bridge but a no holds barred fistfight between Connors and Brodie that in closeup looks like a real brawl between the principals It s sure someone bruised more than an ego
when i saw the movie at first i thought that it was boring because nothing was happening but when all the scary things started to happen like when church dies and is brought back to life and also gage and his mom die and there idiot dad has to bring them back to life even though he nows the warnings and ignores Jud this is not Steven kings best work i thought that his best work was the shining i don t think that people who see this movie and comment on how awful it was are wrong because all they think is that what were they thinking as if that person can do a better job in making a horror flick i mean making the gage evil and how he kills Jud is genius making the most innocent most unsuspecting character into one of the killers is cool people who didn t like the movie are dumb because all it is a scary movie and nothing all don t expect something from a movie that it isn t it still in a general area wasn t that good i still recommend people to watch the movie
There is something about Pet Sematary that I never felt anywhere else Maybe the fact I was a kid when I first watched it made this experience so memorable But as I keep watching it over and over again it never gets old and I never get bored From the opening credits with that creepy opening song to the very chaotic ending there is something insane sad and scary at the same time and it keeps ringing in your head sometimes dead is better br br I don t think it would be useful to relate the whole story again All you need to know is it starts from point A the most perfect situation for a happy American family and step by step drowns to point B which is believe me the very end of all joy The music is perfect the story makes sense the special effects are cool and the Pet Sematary is the last place on earth I would be Like I said sometimes dead is better
Overall this movie was excellent for its time and will be interesting for many more generations to come Although the plot is not 100 accurate to the book most everything is correct The movie does skip far ahead and does miss some important parts I found the book and ready and immediately wished that they had made a movie because I hadn t found out about the movie yet but later I found the movie in a bargain bin at Wal Mart and decided to buy it and see if it was what I had expected Overall I give this movies a 7 out of 10 for its good parts relative accuracy and overall making sense and for its bad parts large time skips and small but noticeable inaccuracies
Personally I absolutely love this movie and novel I read the book first and decided to see the movie First of all the plot is truly original and one of a kind The acting is also great and i love the cast Judd Crandall plays Fred Gwynne fits his role perfectly and really sells it to you There are also a few corny lines thrown in there Idk if they were meant to be corny but they really will lighten up the mood and provide a good laugh The Maine atmosphere is really a perfect spot to film this movie and it kind of draws you in throughout the movie Not only will you love it but you ll want to see it again and again I recommend this 100 to any horror fan
Ah clich√©s clich√©s clich√©s They re a main part of a wide variety of horror films This one has a lot of them Still it s Stephen King one of the best masters of horror This movie was really good just TOO predictable And what horror movie doesn t have stupid people This one is overcrowded with retarded victims just practically begging for their life to be taken Pet Semetary I found to be creepy a little The way everything is set up was REALLY spooky but not terrifying For the most part the acting was SOMEWHAT believable the suspense wasn t that suspenseful but the entertainment level is set at a major rank My eyes were practically glued to the screen All Stephen King fans must see this movie but as for anyone else expect an OKAY thriller
Probably the most accurate Stephen King adaption yet Not surprising since King himself wrote the screenplay The story follows the Creed family moving into a beautiful Maine house One of the other residents is Jud a pleasant old man who knows a few things about the area One is the highway that runs right through their frontyard The other is a path leading to the Pet Sematary where children for decades have buried the animals killed by the highway Soon enough Ellie Creed s cat Church is found dead Luckily this happens while the family with the exception of Louis the father is away for Thanksgiving Jud takes Louis to another burial ground beyond the Pet Sematary where Church is to be buried Later Louis is greeted not so politely by Church He s returned appearing to have chewed his way out of the bag he had been buried in Maybe he was buried alive Maybe not Nothing more I can say without ruining the story br br Of all the King adaptions I ve seen this would be the most terrifying The characters are real and the situations are normal Mary Lambert does a great job directing the proceedings Suspense is kept fairly high throughout the film due in part to the plot development The scene where Gage is killed will stick in your mind forever Then of course we have the conclusion Easy to determine what s going to happen but Lambert pulls off some genuinely scary and sometimes disturbing moments br br Overall this is a good film and an excellent adaption If you enjoy being scared and don t mind being haunted by some occasionally disturbing images then Pet Sematary is just what you re looking for Non Horror fans will want to avoid this
So often with Stephen King adaptations you just get a collection of characters reciting dialogue from the books This really captures the heart of the book Maybe because they DON T use large chunks of text straight from the book but it s a bit more of an improv of the events in the story A big part of its success is Miko Hughes as baby Gage Dale Midkiff and Denise Tasha Yar Crosby really act like his parents There s a scene where Louis is cuddling Gage and they are very natural together Fred Gwynne is WONDERFUL He nails the Maine accent perfectly without lapsing into parody and is wise and warm just like Jud should be 8 out of 10
Ok first I have to point the fact that when I first saw this flick I was 9 years old If I had seen this one two weeks ago for the first time I d probably have noted that this is just another cheaply made cable TV horror film with some well made scenes But when you re nine you just don t care about those facts This scared the hell out of me back then especially those aforementioned Zelda scenes and they still do Nowadays I m kind of hooked to this film I have to see this maybe once in a month and on every new year s eve I watch this with a 12 pack of beer bunch of friends It s like an appetizer for a good party I kinda agree to those people who said that the acting here is pretty unintense Midkiff and Crosby do look like I wanted Louis and Rachel look like but one can t see very much devotion or feelings on the faces of these two Hughes and Gwynne pretty much save the scenes which the Creeds underact What I actually want to say about this is the fact that there really is no other film that has any kind of similarity to Pet Sematary and I don t mean the zombie stuff here THE ATMOSPHERE OF THIS FILM IS CERTAINLY A NOVELTY AND ONE OF A KIND Honestly how many times you have seen a film which on superficial level looks like a cable TV one but leave you with a chill compared to only the best horror chillers out there Alright I busted some of the cast s balls a minute ago but I have to say that all pieces in that level too hone the overall acting to perfection But hey tell me if you really know some film which is similar to Pet Sematary I really would love to know And I don t mean night of the living dead here this one is way beyond compare in intelligence compared to that stuff
Spoilers herein br br What really scares you Killer sharks or maybe ghosts trying to bring back a message Maybe a chainsaw wielding psychopath br br Maybe But those fears don t even compare to a horror which people dare not even speak of or consider and that is the death of one s own child Pet Sematary taps this base primal adult fear and then takes it to places that most could not bear to explore br br I ve read comments about this film that include poor acting characters making stupid decisions etc I disagree The acting is actually first rate for a film like this Maybe it is impossible for many to imagine the desperation resulting from such a scenario But the film s events are not only logical they may be absolutely inevitable if such a scenario were possible This is the true horror of Pet Sematary It isn t that pets and people come back from the dead as evil killers who hunt with knives and scalpels it is that anyone who has lost a child could become so desperate as to commit the crimes that Louis Creed does Despite warning or even past history br br The movie takes those willing to go with it to the depths of a desperate human heart The heart of a protector trying to make up for not being able to protect And the results are horrifying In fact when the film dives into slasher territory near the end it s almost a letdown although I believe it s perfectly logical how it got there br br I am a true horror fan and I contend that this is one of the scariest horror films ever made If you don t think so see it again after you have children
MINOR SPOILER br br Underrated little Stephen King shocker It s not perfect by any stretch of the imagination even if the limp performances of Dale Midkiff and Denise Crosby were better there d still be the mismanaged mystical story elements to contend with The old Micmac burial ground Rachel s terminally ill sister and the Jacob Marley an Victor Pascow never really come together into anything coherent and the film in places feels confused and overstuffed But few horror movies really are perfect and what this one may lack in other areas it makes up for in its willingness to shock Pet Sematary may actually be one of the cruelest horror films in recent memory with its murderous zombie baby and its insanely insensitive portrayal of Zelda It s politically incorrect it s tasteless it s gratuitous and yet it makes us squirm with revulsion in a way safer horror movies never can Add to that one of Fred Gwynne s best performances and Mary Lambert s witty direction and you have an intensely satisfying scary movie even with the hokey ending Highly recommended for genre fans 7 5 out of 10
Pet Sematary succeeds on two major situations First it s a scary Horror movie Those that just aren t produced in these days Second it s an emotional clever movie overall So if you are looking for chills scares creepiness and visually stunning settings great acting dialongs and gruesome effects this is the movie you are looking for A classic now and truly a must see for any Horror fan br br Probably the best adaptation to any of King s novels The events feel a little rushed compared with the novel but that doesn t means that this underrated movie isn t a complete Horror Drama accomplishment br br Stephen King s novel is widely known for being very emotional and gruesome at the same time The movie captures the same feeling mainly because there s a great character development and you can feel the loving relationship between it s members Then when everything seems to be happiness technically happy because the title Pet Sematary does not offers appiness a tragic event changes the movie s atmosphere now it turns very dark The movie has a sinister feeling since the opening credits but after Gage is killed the movie becomes sad gray creepy Dealing with the loss of a baby son is something that can ruin a family s entire life and Pet Sematary proves it dramatically br br The legend behind the pet sematary is more than a myth that no one wants to experience but sadness and desperation lead an emotionally destroyed father to give it a shot Sadly enough the legend comes true and baby Gage returns from the dead The previous encounter with the pet sematary legend turned out to be a tragedy but this time it s something much much worse What will happened with the lives of our All American family Could Pascow prevent this tragedy What is it with the surreal nightmares br br Watch Pet Sematary to witness one of the most touching emotional Horror movies of recent times You won t regret The acting is very good although I didn t dig the actor who portrayed the father He didn t seem disturbed enough when the situations asked for his desperation But that s just my opinion Denise Crosby truly delivered a great performance and worked perfect as the noble tender mother Baby Gage was amazing even on his creepy parts Shivers Overall this is a great classic of all time and a disturbing movie that touches people s deepest fears the loss of someone you love the dead returning to life and a feeling of desperation br br Something is for sure I don t wanna be buried in a pet sematary
Making a book into a movie by following the story page by page is NEVER a good idea When people read the book they automatically start making their own mental movie of who the characters look like the places they exist in how the situations progress And everybody s mind s eye opus is different which is why when the REAL movie finally comes out you re always going to have a ticked off segment of the movie going audience who are disappointed that it just doesn t measure up br br All a screenwriter and a director can hope to accomplish is whatever their own vision of the movie is and hope that it comes as close as possible to what their audience is expecting to see br br There is no better case for this situation than the movies based on the novels of Stephen King When filmmakers capture at least the essence of his stories the results can be breathtaking and truly terrifying CARRIE SALEM S LOT THE DEAD ZONE or they can be what fans consider to be a gawd awful mess Kubrick s version of THE SHINING the miniseries for IT and THE TOMMYKNOCKERS br br Although it s not even close to being the perfect King adaptation PET SEMATARY has so many moments of just skin and bone deep unease that seemed to have bled onto the screen directly from the book that you can pretty much forgive its shortcomings For that we have music video turned film director Mary Lambert to thank she also directed SIESTA not exactly a horror movie but another freaky as hell must see you should put on your list working from a screenplay by the Man ster Himself and probably one of his better ones br br Since the majority of you know the story I won t put you to sleep with too many of the details Dr Louis Creed Dale Midkiff has moved his family out to the perfect house in the country Well almost perfect except for two nasty little details the dangerously busy stretch of interstate highway out in front and the large pet cemetery in the woods out back Since Louis is a veterinarian and has a young toddler for a son well even if you haven t read the book do the frickin math It IS a King story after all so no mystery where this is headed br br It s not so much the destination that counts here but the spooky stops along the way Certain scenes that are so familiar from the book are brought to shivery scream inducing life here Rachel Creed s STAR TREK S Denise Crosby horrific memory of her terminally ill crippled sister Louis s encounters with the mortally injured jogger Victor Pascow Brad Greenquist both before and after his death the trip into the other cemetery beyond the pet cemetery And that third act if it doesn t give you a few nightmares maybe you should check your pulse br br Good performances by all here especially the late Fred Gwynne as the well intentioned neighbor Jud Crandall who gets the best line in the story that sums it all up Sometimes dead is better br br About the only problem with the movie version is the casting of Louis s son Gage Miko Hughes Knowing that it would be damn near impossible to get the kind of performance needed from a kid that age to seal the deal on this Lambert and crew still did the best they could and unfortunately Hughes at the time was just too damn CUTE to sell his intended role as an evil demon possessed zombie This takes you out of the movie whenever he shows up though the scenes where he s featured are still masterfully staged especially Gwynne s death scene br br Other than that everything else is still about as good as it gets CARRIE still holds the title for best King adaptation as far as I m concerned but SEMATARY is right up there in the Top Five br br Still will anything adapted for the screen based on a King book be as terrifying as reading the story Not BLOODY likely for now

I am a fairly big fan of most of the films that have been based on Stephen King s books this one rates as one of the scariest and most memorable br br I have just finished rewatching it for about the tenth time and I still find it heart wrenching as well as scary br br The scene where Gage is on a sure collision course with the monster truck is one which stands out And the No fair uttered by little Miko Hughes near the end is a touch of brilliance br br
Pet Sematary is an adaptation from the Stephen King novel of the same title The story follows the Creeds an all American middle class family who move into a house out in the country The family consists of Louis and Rachel and their two young children Ellie and their toddler son Gage The house couldn t be better and the family meets a strange but friendly old man Jud who lives across the road He leads them down an old path into the woods one day where a pet graveyard lies filled with a huge amount of animal graves And just beyond there lies a sacred Indian burial ground that seems to possess a strange power When the family cat Church is killed Louis sees it fit to bury him in the pet cemetery and strangely enough soon after Church returns to life But there s something evil about him now he isn t the same cat he used to be And when a tragic accident takes the life of young Gage Louis decides to apply the same concept in hopes of reviving his dead son unfortunately he gets more than he bargained for br br Having read Stephen King s novel I can say that the book is much better than the film Not to say the movie is bad because it isn t the book is just a little bit better The real strength in this film lies in it s story which is both bizarre but extremely original something that King s stories are typically known for The script is very well adapted from the story and while it minorly differs in some aspects it s a pretty good page to screen transformation There are a few plot holes here and there nothing major though Besides that this movie is actually pretty scary and it succeeds in it s intention to do so There are some really disturbing scenes throughout the film and I d have to say that the flashback sequence of Rachel s sister Zelda is the number one Honestly that is one of the most disgusting disturbing things I ve ever seen in a horror film it s not gory and bloody it s just flat out sickening One thing s for sure that image won t leave your head anytime soon br br The performances in this film were all very up to par and I really had no problem there This film is actually on the gory side there are plenty of nasty little sequences to please all of the gore hounds out there including the shocker of an ending I really liked the way they ended the film it was abrupt and somewhat inconclusive but it worked better that way with all things considered br br Overall Pet Sematary is a good horror movie that I d recommend to those who are fans of either Stephen King or just fans of the genre in general The story is the film s greatest asset and it s a creepy one too One of the better Stephen King adaptations I d say 7 10
Louis Creed a doctor from Chicago moves to a large house near a small town since he is going to be giving classes in the University of Maine s Along with him is his wife Rachel and their two kids Ellie and Gage as well as Ellie s cat Church Soon they met their new neighbor and old man named Judd Crandall Judd not only warns Louis and Rachel about the danger that is the highway that runs past their house that is constantly a way used by big trucks but also show to the family a pet cemetery that is located near their house Judd starts to talk about the importance of the pet cemetery but Rachel is against to talk about death and spirituality with her children since she has traumas from her sister Zelda s death br br During the first week of the family in the new house Louis already has dead people to deal with Victor Pascow a student who has been fatally injured in an automobile accident addresses his dying words to Louis personally even though the two men are strangers On the night following Pascow s death Louis experiences what he believes is a very vivid dream in which he meets Pascow who leads him to the pet cemetery and warns Louis to not go beyond no matter how much you feel you need to Louis wakes up in bed the next morning convinced it was only a dream until he discovers his feet and the bedsheets covered with dirt and pine needles Anyway he dismisses the dream Many strange things starts to happen and Church Ellie s cat dies while walking on the highway Louis stays worried in how he is going to talk about Church s death with Ellie but Judd sympathizing with him Jud takes Louis to the pet cemetery supposedly to bury Church But instead of stopping there Jud leads Louis farther on a frightening journey to the real cemetery an ancient burial ground that was once used by the Micmac Indians There Louis buries the cat on Jud s instruction with Jud saying that animals buried there have come back to life And that is where the real horror story begins br br I personally find this movie very good It s not THE most horrifying of all but it is one of the best horror movies I watched The way Gage dies is almost impossible to not stay in your memory specially being a toddler It s cool to see Stephen King s cameo as the minister of the funeral br br Of course there are some script errors How can a rich doctor with two small kids goes to live in a place where there is a dangerous highway near his house How Gage has no scratches or anything after being hit by a truck Why Louis continues to resurrect every member of his family knowing they are all going to stay like monsters Things like that doesn t make any sense but I can understand that all horror s scripts needs to have some surreal ideas to work br br A good thing I saw in this movie is the necessity to talk about death with the children no matter what is your religion or if you are an atheist and also that avoiding important subjects doesn t help anything Because of Louis being afraid to be honest with Ellie confronting her and saying that her cat wouldn t be back again all the nightmare began
As this happens to be one of most favorite novels I was very excited to see the move I was not disappointed Yes of course there are a few things that I could pick on but I think that the movie stuck true to the book and was a really good movie It seems that Stephen King films mostly get a bad review but this is one of the good ones It is such a dark story which I guess is why I like it and what is better than the dead coming to life and something about animals returning from the grave is quite creepy too If you have seen the movie do yourself a huge favor and now read the book It is a well written screen play the actors could have done a better job I only say this for Rachel and Ellie she was so whinny I liked everyone else a lot and most important to me it stuck true with the novel
In the trivia section for Pet Sematary it mentions that George Romero director of two Stephen King stories Creepshow and The Dark Half was set to direct and then pulled out One wonders what he would ve brought to the film as the director Mary Lambert while not really a bad director doesn t really bring that much imagination to this adaptation of King s novel of which he wrote the screenplay There are of course some very effective grotesquely surreal scenes mainly involving the sister Zelda likely more of a creep out for kids if they see the film and the casting in some of the roles is dead perfect But something feels missing at times some sort of style that could correspond with the unmistakably King like atmosphere which is in this case about as morbid as you re going to get without incestuous cannibals rising from the graves being thrown in who knows if he ll save that for his final novel br br As mentioned though some of the casting is terrific notably Miko Hughes as Gage Creed the little boy who goes from being one of the cutest little kids this side of an 80 s horror movie to being a little monster I say that as a compliment of course especially in scenes brandishing a certain scalpel And there is also a juicy supporting role for Fred Gwynne of the Munsters who plays this old secretive man with the right notes of under playing and doom in tone And applause goes to whomever did the make up on Andrew Hubatsek But there are some other flaws though in the other casting Dale Midkiff is good not great as the conflicted disturbed father figure Creed and his daughter Ellie is played by an actress that just didn t work for me at all br br In terms of setting up some chilling set pieces only a couple really stand out a certain plot thickening moment not to spoil it does involve a cool Ramones song and the first visit to the pet sematary the bigger one including the sort of mystical overtones King had in the Shining For the most part it s a very polished directing job though it could ve been made even darker to correspond with the script If thought out in logical terms albeit in King terms it is really one of his more effective works of the period But it doesn t add up like it could or should Still it makes for a nifty little midnight movie
Pet Semetary 1989 9 10 The Creed family have just moved into the small town of Ludlow The family consists of a father Louis a mother Rachel a brother Gage and a daughter Ellen They are greeted with kindness by Jud Crandall Jud is 89 and could basically tell you about the entire history of Ludlow br br Behind the Creed s new house there is a path leading to a pet cemetery spelled pet sematary When Ellen wants to go up to see it Jud willfully takes the family on a trip That is the start of hell for the Creed family br br When Rachel and the kids are gone Ellen s cat Church dies Jud feels that Ellen isn t ready for the death of her cat so he suggests Louis follow him further up the path past the pet cemetery br br Jud tells Louis of this burial ground once used by Micmac Indians Louis buries Church without Jud s help A couple of days later Church returns alive but from hell br br This movie was one of two horror movies that could actually scare me aside from The Exorcist The greatest performance would ever be Zelda Rachel s sister with spinal meningitis or Victor Pascow a ghost who tries to help the Creeds from making the mistake of bringing back things from the dead br br The music in this movie plays an extravagant part It is at the same time sad and mysterious It goes along with the movie wonderfully br br 9 10
I am a big fan of Stephen King s work and this film has made me an even greater fan of King Pet Sematary is about the Creed family They have just moved into a new house and they seem happy But there is a pet cemetery behind their house The Creed s new neighbor Jud played by Fred Gwyne explains the burial ground behind the pet cemetery That burial ground is pure evil Jud tells Louis Creed that when you bury a human being or any kind of pet up in the burial ground they would come back to life The only problem is that when they come back they are NOT the same person they re evil Soon after Jud explains everything about the Pet Sematary everything starts to go to hell I wont explain anymore because I don t want to give away some of the main parts in the film The acting that Pet Sematary had was pretty good but needed a little bit of work The story was one of the main parts of this movie mainly because it was so original and gripping This film features lots of make up effects that make the movie way more eerie and frightening One of the most basic reasons why this movie sent chills up my back was in fact the make up effects There is one character in this film that is truly freaky That character is Zelda This particular character pops up in the film about three times to be precise Zelda is Rachel Creed s sister who passed away years before but Rachel is still haunted by her The first time Zelda appears in the movie isn t generally scary because she isn t talking or anything but the second time is the worst and to be honest the second time scares the living out of me There is absolutely nothing wrong with this movie it is almost perfect Pet Sematary delivers great scares some pretty good acting first rate plot and mesmerizing make up This is truly one of most favorite horror films of all time 10 out of 10
Pet Sematary is a very good horror film and believe it or not somebody can make a good horror film out of a Stephen King novel Mary Lambert does a great job with this film and manages to bring across King s creepy story pretty well Most people may avoid this but they should check it out
One of the best if not the best Stephen King s screenings Dark as dark can be surprising non hollywood ending terrifying atmosphere amazing book adaptation outstanding cast educational don t play with afterlife in short everything an excellent horror should be br br My favorite horror movie straight 10
This scary and rather gory adaptation of Stephen King s great novel features outstanding central performances by Dale Midkiff Fred Gwynne who sadly died few years ago and Denise Crosby and some really gruesome gore effects Director Mary Lambert has a wonderful sense of visual style and manages to make this one of the few versions of King s work that is not only worth seeing but genuinely unnerving The depiction of the zombie child Gage Miko Hughes later in New Nightmare is equally noteworthy as what could easily have been a laughable character is made menacing and spooky As for the people who think that this one isn t scary watch it alone in the dark eventually with your squeamish girlfriend and I guarantee you that Pet Sematary will creep you out Some horror movies like this one or The Texas Chain Saw Massacre shouldn t be watched in group Recommended for horror fans
I have screened this movie several times here at college and every time I show it the number of people watching with me grows exponentially in addition to the virgins anyone I ve already shown it to NEEDS to see it again It takes a little while to get into it but by the end the whole room is screaming shouting yelling rewinding scenes repeatedly repeating dialogue and just totally and completely engrossed in the moviegoing experience that is Pia Zadora in The Lonely Lady Scene after scene after scene of the most ineptly filmed poorly written horribly acted TRASH is thrown at you in an all out assault that ranks as the campiest thing I own no small statement friends For me nothing compares 2 U Pia and I don t suppose I m the only one who s ever felt this way
I kind of liked The Lonely Lady Give Pia a break She looks great and she has really nice eyes What s not to like The scene where she gets raped by Ray Liotta with a garden hose was kind of gross and cruel Actually a LOT of stuff that happens in this movie is gross and cruel But its a trashy movie A lot of movies that are trashy are not all bad I liked this better than Valley of the Dolls which was not only trashy but boring as well At least this wasn t boring br br Pia gets naked a lot and seems miscast as a writer Watching her talk about Pushkin and Byron with a guy three times her age is flat unbelievable I m sure Pia s a nice person in real life she just doesn t project the writer vibe She looked much happier when she was working as a hostess for that guy from Saturday Night Fever and wearing a glittery disco dress br br A couple of the scenes are funny The one where she tells the two timing actor that she s pregnant and he rolls his eyes and snaps at her to stop hanging around all the while he s practically fawning over every bimbo who flounces by br br Pia s nervous breakdown scene is good It was probably a mistake to go so supernova on it the vortex of floating faces and freeze frame scream whoa and her subsequent catatonic stupor is kind of overdone br br The acceptance speech is a hoot though I want to see someone do that speech in a drama class br br But again this is trash we re talking about You could find worse on any movie of the week back in the eighties
Bad script bad direction over the top performances overwrought dialogue What more could you ask for For laughs it just doesn t get any better than this Zadora s over acting combined with the cliched scenarios she finds herself in make for an hilarious parody of the Hollywood machine Almost as funny as Spinal Tap even though it was clearly not intended as such Don t miss Ray Liotta s debut film line Looks like a penis
The title has many meanings the boxing ring where differences and grievances are fought out a wedding ring where Mabel feels trapped and Jack feels his troubles will be over and the cause of the trouble a ring like bracelet that Bill gives Mabel as a love token br br Former professional boxer Danish Carl Brisson was given his start in films by Alfred Hitchcock in The Ring A very young Ian Hunter who went on to have such a long career in movies plays Bob Corby who catches the eye of a pretty girl Mabel Lillian Hall Davis at a fun fair She happens to be engaged to One Round Jack Sander Carl Brisson but that doesn t stop her flirting with Bob Bob is persuaded to go one round with Jack He goes several rounds and wins he is a professional boxer and he and his manager have come to the fair to find out if Jack is as good a fighter as they have heard He offers to take Jack on and Jack goes off along with his boorish trainer the great Gordon Harker to make his fortune with plans to marry Mabel when he makes good Jack wins his fight and marries Mabel the next day but the deep attraction that she and Bob feel for each other is still there Jack is suspicious and puts everything into his training so he can fight Bob for his wife br br At last a boxing movie where the hero doesn t go off the rails Bob behaves himself and does everything he can to be a champion if only Mabel acted in the same way She has left him for Bob and the fight at the end is a mighty one It is intensely realistic it occupies the last 20 minutes of the film From being raw and enthusiastic Jack is almost knocked out then between rounds reuniting with Mabel gives him the courage to triumph The question is why would he even want her back from the start she thought nothing of starting an affair with Bob why wouldn t she do it again br br The film is loaded with symbolism Jack shaking hands with the promoter changes to Mabel s hands accepting a bracelet from Bob When Jack puts the ring on Mabel s finger Bobs bracelet slips down her arm At the end Jack sees Mabel s reflection in a ringside water bucket and that gives him the confidence to go on This is an excellent film that will not disappoint you br br Highly Recommended
One Round Jack Sander is called that because he s a carnival boxer who fights any man in the audience If they can last one round they win a prize a popular way to draw customers into traveling shows long ago Jack is in love with the ticket girl Mabel though her head is quickly turned when Bob Corby enters the ring to try his chances with Jack What no one at the fight knows is that Bob is the champ so he s able to beat Jack though it takes him some work As a result Bob asks Jack to become his sparring partner and give up the carnival circuit Later Jack improves so much that he too becomes a legitimate boxer Slowly he works his way up the rankings until he s nearly ready to take on the Champ br br In the meantime the Champ and Mabel start running around behind Jack s back even though by now Mabel has married Jack So when the final fight occurs between Jack and Bob it s very personal and Jack is ready to kill him Is he good enough Will rise justifiable rage against Bob help or hinder his performance Tune in and see br br This film was directed by Alfred Hitchcock and while today this sort of film seems strange for a director known for mystery suspense films back in the 1920s Hitchcock had no fixed genre which he directed or wrote he did both for this film In fact in many ways this film is more indicative of Hitchcock s silent style as a somewhat similar plot came up in one of his next silents THE MANXMAN also starring Carl Brisson as the wronged husband So while this seems a lot like a standard boxing film of the day it was not a radical departure for this great director even with its rather formulaic ending br br Overall while a bit predictable and having Ian Hunter playing a boxing champ seems silly the film works well While far from a perfect silent it s well worth seeing and packs a nice punch
Another silent love triangle film from Hitchcock not a mystery but very English very well paced and photographed Smooth boxer Bob Corby Ian Hunter recruits circus boxer One Round Jack Sander Carl Brisson to be his sparring partner partly to keep the pretty but fickle Mabel Lilian Hall Davis nearby There are lots of character actors and grotesques at Jack and Mabel s wedding the verger standing in the aisle of the church registers shock at the sight of the very tall and the very short men the fat lady the conjoined twins who of course argue about which side of the aisle to sit and the wedding feast is amusing The rest of the movie has Jack losing Mabel and boxing his way back to her heart or something like that It was another era altogether with the audience in evening dress and the boxers dressing up too when out of the ring The camera angles the pace the use of symbols the cutting all very stylish and masterful The camera work and editing of the last boxing match is very gripping Brisson s good looks are well used in this one his smiling is not so oblivious of what s going on around him as he is in Hitchcock s The Manxman and so is not annoying But can boxers have such dimples
Hitchcock displays his already developed understanding for visuals in this early silent film The plot of the film involving two boxers fighting over a girl is straight forward drama without much to recommend it Hitchcock s talent though is found in his stunning use of images Nearly every shot is filled with visual symbols Especially memorable is the jewelry that one boxer gives the girl just before she marries the other boxer He slides it up her arm in a clearly sexual way and with one simple movement Hitch has shown us all we need to know The boxing scenes are handled well with some interesting point of view shots that again prove how far ahead of his time Hitchcock was The film also gives insight into his later treatment of women The object of the boxers desires is driven by money and lust not reason or love The only other women in the film are either beautiful party girls who make open offers of sex or old crones who help to destroy happy relationships All in all the Ring is a must for anyone interested in Hitchcock s early work and his development as a visual storyteller
I sometimes grow weary of reading reviews of some of Hitchcock s lesser known films because almost every single one starts out with someone saying this film is grossly overlooked or this is a hidden Hitchcock gem or a true Hitchcock great or some other generic if only people would watch this they would see that this is a great Hitchcock film just as much as Vertigo North by Northwest Psycho Rear Window etc So that being said I would just like to say that if only people would watch this they would see that this is a great Hitchcock film just as much as Vertigo North by Northwest Psycho Rear Window etc br br Now that may be overshooting a little bit The Ring is not by any stretch of the imagination even in the same league as any of those films mentioned twice above but compared to the other films that Hitchcock made in the late 1920s and early 1930s I really think that The Ring is one of the best photographed and performed films of mostly all of them As an almost brand new director there are some astonishing dream sequences and brilliant segments of editing which show why Hitchcock was generating so much attention early in his career br br Granted the film does start with among other things the highly disturbing spectacle of an idiot black circus performer and I use idiot in the definitive manner the way Stephen King so often does having eggs and fruit thrown at him by a crowd of not the classiest looking white people I suppose this only illustrates how incredibly different such circuses and people were back then but I think it is one of the most off putting sequences in any Hitchcock film I ve seen br br The main attraction at the circus is a fighter who claims to be able to knock any man down in one round but when he meets his match it is against a man that challenges his authority not only in the boxing ring but also in the ring around his wife s finger So begins an entertaining if not very tense challenge for the love of one woman who seems to sway from one man to the other effortlessly and thoughtlessly br br spoilers There is for example a scene where her husband watches her from above as she is dropped off at home late at night and just before going into the building she is coaxed back to the car for a kiss This kiss is never explained and there is also the fact that even at the end when she proves faithful to her husband or at least ultimately chooses him they look into each other s eyes but do not actually kiss br br The film is certainly beautifully photographed even more so than several films that Hitch released in subsequent years There is also a performance by Gordon Harker as One Round Jack s trainer who in his stone faced expressionism reminds me quite often of the brilliant Buster Keaton Hitch leaves it a bit ambiguous but this is a great sample of his early work
This early film has its flaws a predictable plot and some overlong scenes of dubious relevance but it already clearly demonstrates Hitchcock s mastery of editing and the use of powerful images It s also among the most expressionist of his films stylistically note for examples the weird distortions he uses during the party sequence and the frequent echoes of both title and plot in the imagery br br Its core though remains the final match which is still among the more exciting examples of cinematic boxing Even though you know that the hero has to win it becomes quite believable that he will lose and the movement of his wife from the champion s corner to his motivating the final plot pay off is very well entwined with the progress of the match The inserts of the stopwatch do exactly what they should you can almost hear the ticking even though this is a silent film the visuals often have a surprisingly auditory feel to them The pacing becomes astonishingly rapid and the viewer gets sucked into the excitement and brutality of both the match and the sexual jealousy which underlies it br br The only DVD release with which I am familiar is that of Laserlight a public domain company As with each Hitchcock silent they ve released they ve attached various musical selections mostly orchestral to the action The sound editing is frequently sloppy and the sound quality varies widely but some genuine care seems to have gone into most of the actual choices and the music accompanying the final match works extremely well it is unlikely that this sequence will ever be better accompanied than it is here br br This is a much more impressive film than its present obscurity would suggest It deserves an honorable place in both the Hitchcock canon and the slender list of worthwhile boxing films
Surprisingly good early effort from Alfred Hitchcock One of the only original screenplays written by Hitchcock himself this film shows remarkable story structure It kicks off with a rousing boxing match in which carnival champ One Round Jack loses to a challenger from the audience who happens to be a professional prizefighter The movie then slows down to develop the characters and introduce a love triangle between Jack his girl and the professional boxer The rest of the film is a dramatic buildup to the rematch between the two men this time for the heavyweight crown Even in this early film Hitchcock shows his talent for meaningful cinematography and prop placement An armband bought for the girl by the boxer continues to pop up throughout the movie as a symbol of her unfaithfulness The only big detractor of this film is that the art of filming a boxing match had not yet been perfected in 1927 The final match as a result ends up being somewhat anticlimactic The story though is what carries this film through
At first I thought the Ring would be a more than normal movie with it s ordinary plot How surprised was I Of course the plot is simple one girl is in love with two men but Hitchcock brings it to us on a silver platter with laughter and fear with compassion and anguish The way he depicts the popular crowds of the fair the strength of the attraction of the girl to both men the tragic elements that come together with techniques that open the mind to most of his greatest movies North by Northwest the Rope etc The master did it great even before his thirties
The Ring was made from the only screenplay Hitchcock wrote himself and it deals as many of his earliest pictures do with a love triangle At first glance it looks like a more cynical update of the infidelity themed morality comedies of Cecil B De Mille but more than that it is the first really competent Hitchcock picture Even if he was not yet using the ideas and motifs of suspenseful thrillers he was at least developing the tools with which to create suspense br br As well as being a student of the German Expressionist style the rhythmic editing style of Sergei Eisenstein had had its impact upon Hitchcock But here he keeps tempo not just with the edits but with the content of the imagery This is apparent from the opening shots where spinning fairground rides brilliantly establish a smooth tempo And like Eisenstein the editing style seems to suggest sound for example when a split second shot of the bell being rung is flashed in we almost subconsciously hear the sound because the image is so jarring br br There is also a contrast particularly with silent films from the US in that The Ring is not cluttered up with too many title cards As much as possible is conveyed by imagery and Hitch has enough faith in the audience to either lip read or at least infer the meaning of the bulk of the characters speech And it s not done by contrived symbolism or overacting it s all done by getting the right angles and the right timing particularly with point of view shots as well as some strong yet subtle performances There are unfortunately a few too many obvious expressionist devices particularly double exposures many of which were unnecessary but there is far less of this than there is in The Lodger br br Let s make a few honourable mentions for the aforementioned actors First up the stunningly handsome and very talented Carl Brisson in the lead role In spite of his talent I was at first a bit confused as to why he got the role as to be honest he looks more like a ballet dancer than a pugilist But that just goes to show how much I know as it turns out Brisson was in fact a former professional boxer and inexperienced in acting Playing his rival is the competent Ian Hunter who would go on to have a lengthy career in supporting roles right up to the 60s The most demanding role in The Ring has to be that given to Lillian Hall Davis torn between two lovers She pulls it off very well however with an emotive understated performance and it s a shame her career never lasted in the sound era And last but not least the great Gordon Harker provides some comic relief in what is probably his best ever role br br The Ring s climactic fight scene is among the most impressive moments of silent era Hitchcock Martin Scorcese may have had his eye on The Ring when he directed the fight scenes in Raging Bull as his watchword for these scenes was Stay inside the ring The fight in The Ring starts off with some fairly regular long shots but when the action intensifies Hitchcock drops us right in the middle of it with close ups and point of view shots Hitchcock s aim always seems to have been to involve his audience and this was crucial in his later career where the secret of his success was often in immersing the viewer in the character s fear or paranoia br br The Ring really deserves more recognition than the inferior but better known The Lodger It s a much more polished and professional work than the earlier picture and probably the best of all his silent features
The symbolic use of objects form editing the position of characters in the scene these were all used with such joyous abandon by Hitchcock that you can really see what a fertile genius he had The way the wife moves from one corner of the ring to the other as the fight progresses the editing when the wedding ring is placed on her finger while these may seem a bit obvious by todays standards in the silent era they spoke volumes about the story without a word being spoken Even the title has a least four meanings that I can see the boxing ring the wedding ring the bracelet the lover buys and the love triangle at the heart of the story
This movie does a great job of explaining the problems that we faced and the fears that we had before we put man into space As a history of space flight it is still used today in classrooms that can get one of the rare prints of it Disney has shown it on Vault Disney and I wish they would do so again
I have not seen this movie At least not in its entirety I have seen a few haunting clips which have left me gagging to see it all One sequence remains in my memory to this day A very convincing looking spacecraft is orbiting the dark side of the moon The pilot releases a flash device in order to photograph the hidden surface below him The moon flashes into visability and for a few seconds there it is Parallel lines squares Could it be then the light fades and the brief glimse of what has gone and it is time for the spacecraft to return to Earth Wonderful I have seen some other clips too but would LOVE to obtain the full movie
This documentary was nominated for an Oscar and it s easy to see why Even 45 years later it is quite an impressive piece of work Why it isn t in print is a mystery that only Disney can explain Good use of live footage and animation in tandem This used to run as part of Vault Disney every few months or so but I haven t seen it listed in quite a while sigh Most recommended
Oh where are you going my little one little one br br Turn around and you re two turn around and you re four br br I remember these shows when they were first broadcast on Disneyland I remember sitting there electrified by Werner Van Braune s explanations of rocket science I watched as history science and humor were all interwoven in an engrossing story of possibilities br br That was fifty years ago And the shows are back in the Disney Treasures series and what a treasure they are I watched them last night and tonight with my 8 year old daughter who at first would not even come in the room but later changed her mind when she saw they were partly animated As she watched I watched her and by the end she was nearly as engrossed as I had been br br Turn around and you re a young wife with babes of your own br br Sure some of the predictions about reaching the moon were wrong But there is a lot of information that is still quite accurate and the overall presentation is still impressive I found myself thinking my daughter s teacher might want to show them to her class not only as a 50 year old artifact but also as fun and easy to understand lessons in history br br Turn around turn around turn around and again you re wondering how much has really changed in 50 years
Buddy is an entertaining family film set in a time when humanizing animals and making them cute was an accepted way to get people to be interested in them br br Based on a true story Buddy shows the great love that the main characters have for animals and for each other and that they will do anything for each other br br While not a perfect movie the animated gorilla is quite lifelike most of the time and the mayhem that occurs within the home is usually amusing for children br br This film misses an opportunity to address the mistake of bringing wild animals into the home as pets but does show the difficulties br br A recommended film which was the first for Jim Henson Productions
Trudy Lintz Rene Russo was one very fortunate lady many years ago She was the wife of a wealthy doctor and had lots of extracurricular money Her passion was animals and she devoted herself to providing a sanctuary for the furry ones on her property grounds Trudy also raised two chimps in her home to be more like children They dressed in clothes and had many amenities One day she learns of an abandoned baby gorilla Knowing nothing about the large apes she relies on her husband s medical abilities and expert advice to save the gorilla s life Once out of danger Trudy decides she will raise the gorilla also as one of her children This works well for years and Buddy the gorilla is truly a remarkably intelligent addition to her home But Buddy is also a gorilla and his strength and curiosity become quite enormous Will Trudy be able to keep Buddy under control For those who love animals Buddy is a must see movie Based on a true story Trudy and her ape develop a relationship that is unique in the annals of animal history and lore Of course Buddy is not a real gorilla but a mechanical one in the film but he is very close to seeming totally real Russo gives a nice performance as a lady ahead of her time and the supporting players are also quite nice The costumes are exemplary as befitting the earlier era of the story and the settings and production values outstanding But most importantly animals are here in abundance not only Buddy but the adorable chimps the ducks the rabbits and so forth For those who want to watch a film and be transported to animal heaven here on earth this is a great movie choice All animal lovers and even those who just want to watch a great family film will go ape over Buddy
I enjoyed the innocence of this film and how the characters had to deal with the reality of having a powerful animal in their midst The gorilla looks just terrific and the eyes were especially lifelike It s even a little scary at times and should have children slightly frightened without going over the top Rene Russo plays her role wonderfully feminine Usually these type of Hollywood films that take place in the past feel the need to create a straw man villain but the only adversary is the gorilla It s an interesting look at how close some animals are to humans how they feel the same emotions we do and yet how we really can t treat them just like people because they aren t Not many films venture into this territory and it s worth seeing if you want to contemplate the human animal similarity
This picture came out in 1975 and it was the second in the three part series of the life of Sheriff Buford Pusser Bo Svenson takes over the role of Sheriff Buford Pusser and Luke Askew plays the role of Mobster Pinky Dobson The last that we saw Sheriff Pusser he was laying in a hospital bed after him and his wife who was killed in ambushed Sunday morning drive After Pusser recovers he goes after the men that killed his wife Is Pusser able to complete the revenge that he s after or does the mob try to take him out before he successes The only thing that bother me about this picture that this was an actual true story How could you leave in a town with this kind of crime and yet don t do anything about it Since there was real no name actress in this picture I can t give it 10 weasel stars but I can give 8
This second film is just as interesting as the previous one except that there is no suspense We know what he is going to do and what is going to happen before it is even hinted at on the screen Then the pleasure comes only from the way the various tricks happen and the succession of them We know there will be dynamite in the car that he will lose a wheel that the car will have a crash just to speak of the car And that is what happens Now the details and the particulars are for you to discover them in the film That he may be baited by some dumb woman is obvious and has to come but we know that he has already seen through her and that he knows he is being dragged into a trap Now how is he going to get out of it That s what you must discover by yourself And don t worry he will get the main trafficker but how is another story A speed boat is no match to our busy beaver on the river We also know when he is going to be wounded They did not know what bullet proof jackets were in those days It s true recently it was discovered that some GIs did not have that kind of equipment in Iraq But what is the meaning of such a film This insistence on hunting the traffickers and this blindness that does not see that it is the prohibition that creates the problem But the film is a constant and perfect illustration that there is no value what so ever that can stand in the way of this moralistic crusade against the forces of evil Why not simply legalize these goods so that they can be properly observed and under surveillance When something is not illegal or pushed out of the way it is all the less fun to use them to do them It is the forbidden or the restricted that is attractive br br Dr Jacques COULARDEAU University Paris Dauphine University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines
This was the first Walking Tall movie I saw I think in a 2 movie theater along Hollywood Blvd so I didn t have any reference to the first installment done by Joe Don Baker I remember being shocked at the corrupted system of McNairy County and the brutality of the redneck gangs I was also amazed at the fact that one man decided he s not going to let it slide and went out to do something about it Courageous I thought so to a point where it sent shivers up my spine br br I think this movie is a great story about American courage to stand up and do something about a system that s only serving its own interest I was pretty blown away about it and think this is still one of the best movie of the hero anti hero genre which one might laugh but includes recent movies like the The Punisher but even more so because it s a true story The recent remake starring the Rock just doesn t do any justice to the real fire in the story of Buford Pusser br br A classic that I m sure will resurface again in the future
I first watched the Walking Tall movies when I was about 8 years old and I thought both Joe Don Baker and Bo Svenson did a great job they must have anyway because since watching the movies I have tried to learn as much about the real Sheriff Buford Pusser as I can All 3 parts of the movie gave me chills and Buford Pusser was a true hero I only wish he were alive today and that there were more people like him I would love to thank him for getting rid of all the crime and being so brave I am very sorry that his family had to go through such horror and pain My heart goes out to them So from a 30 year old fan of Sheriff Pusser and of the 3 part Walking Tall movies and the actors that portrayed him please do not be negative about these movies and actors they were only trying to let us know what a wonderful man the real Buford Pusser was and what a great family he had And to all the young people who may have not heard much about Buford I suggest you watch the Walking Tall movies and learn more about him
The story is extremely unique It s about these 2 pilots saving Earth from alien beings but they have to use a special speed that makes everything around them age rapidly The whole series is about the pilots dealing with the loss of time friends and mentors br br The ending COULD have been fantastic It started to end on a total down note and leave a real mark but instead ended on a super happy Disney note and annoyed me VERY bad br br The animation is decent for 89 but can t compare to nowadays I have also heard many complain about the cheesiness of the nudity I actually found it to be somewhat decent The nudity for the most part was warranted except in episode 2 where there was an excess br br Overall it deserves a look but the ending keeps it from being a classic
Being an otaku since the days of Robotech I can still say that Gunbuster is one of my favorite animes of all time Considering when it was made the animation is of superior quality There are no loops and sequences in which the art decreases in quality Although the final episode is in black and white it does not detract from the enjoyment of watching the film Although it has been described as being sappy it should be kept in mind that females do not react in the same way that males do Since the main character is a female it should be obvious that she does not necessarily need to resort to macho man tactics in order to gain the respect of her peers The seiryuu for Noriko incidentally also plays Akane in Ranma 1 2 Noriko is as 3 dimensional a cartoon can get her personality captures the essence of a spirited girl who seems at first to be completely helpless but in the end succeeds through the strength of her will The only complaint I have is that the mecha looked somewhat like teddy bears Even the Gunbuster utilizes a rather dubious Homing Laser and Buster Shield which is nothing more than having the machine wrap a giant velvety cloak around itself in true Dracula style technique I doubt that scene was meant to be funny but it cracked me up Yet all in all I would rank Gunbuster in the top 20 anime of all time
This anime is a must see for fans of Evangelion It s an earlier work of Anno Hideaki but his unrestrained dramatic style is quite in place Also those who didn t like Evangelion might find this release to bit slightly more palatable Gunbuster is rather unique to sci fi anime in that it s actually based on real science In fact the show has several little Science Lesson interludes explaining the physics behind some of the events in the movie One of the big dramatic points in the film is the relative passage of time at speeds near that of light The series does a wonderful job of dealing with the imaginably traumatic experience of leaving earth on a six month mission traveling near the speed of light and returning to an Earth where ten years have passed The main character remains age 17 or 18 throughout the entire series while almost all of the other characters age considerably Be warned this show is heavy on the sap at times It also has a couple of the most wholly unmerited breast shots that I have ever seen I found it fairly easy to ignore the skimpy uniforms and boo hoo scenes because the series is otherwise very good but viewers with a low sap tolerance might want to stay away from this one On an interesting note Gainax as always managed to run out of money in the last couple of episodes However they managed to use black and white film and still action sketches to produce a good resolution anyway The ending is a bit silly but it left me with such a good feeling in my gut I couldn t help but love it Gunbuster is in my opinion one of the finest pieces of Anime around
slight spoilers br br Way back before Evangelion was made before Hideaki Anno was an idol and household name for many anime fans and before Gainax had reached the status of fanfavorite Gunbuster was made With only Wings of Honneamise made by Gainax at that time and the famous Otakon shorts or course Gunbuster had some tough acts to follow up It didn t make it easier on itself by picking out a genre that was already done countless times before space opera br br Luckily Gainax decided to put it out as a six part OAV direct to video series This allows the series to have a bigger scope than would have been possible if it was made into a film This also prevents it from becoming too boring and overly long with lots of pointless battles and filler along the way Besides that they made some effort to stay clear from the tested space opera mechanics used in Macross or Gundam and many other popular space operas br br For one the shows starts out pretty light with Noriko in the Okinawa High School for mechapiloting Noriko is the daughter of a respected ship commander who died in battle when she was still a little kid This makes her life at the academy quite hard as some of her fellow classmates start to suspect that Noriko is favored by the professors The first episode is pretty much a comedy drama with a very tight focus on the characters and setting of the school Things quickly change when the threat of an alien invasion is announced and Noriko and Kazumi best girl in class are chosen to help the assembled fleet out br br The middle bulk of Gunbuster leaves our female lead in space focusing on both personal drama and action A couple more characters are introduced and parts of Noriko s past are dragged up again Besides that the alien threat becomes more imminent every minute and the Gunbuster mankind s final hope is presented Smart as writer Okada was he incorporated the principles of time dilation to spice things up a bit In short time moves slower for those who travel at the speed of light This means that Noriko can be part of a war that takes almost a century to complete Also the dramatic aspect of this is accentuated when Noriko sees her friends again on her return to base who have aged considerably more than her The science might not be perfect but it s presented in a pretty believable way with even some SD science theatre shorts in between the episodes where Noriko Kazumi and their coach give a short description of the scientific principles used in the series br br The animation for a series made in the 80s is definitely good The designs are retro 80s style of course but it has it s charm Animation is fluent enough and the character designs are nice although the costumes do betray br br some of the fanservice fascination Gainax will later exploit to the fullest The mechas throughout the shows are pretty cool too with the Gunbuster as the ultimate killing machine strong and vast The last episode was entirely done in black and white While it s generally believed but not confirmed that this was done for budget reasons it lends a whole different atmosphere to the series which is suited perfectly for the latter part br br The music is very typical space opera fair Too bombastic in places very generic and definitely not worth buying It does fit the series for the most part but it can become quite annoying at times Tanaka is not really a famous composer and the only other respectable series he s worked on is Dragon Half If you think 80s anime music you will know what to expect br br As the series progresses the focus slowly shifts from drama to space opera to epic battle but in such a way the viewer will hardly notice this Step by step the drama will be toned down and the battles will take the front row Neither aspect is ever left completely out though With the last episode in sight Noriko and crew are fighting for the further existence of human kind and with the last battle in sight certain questions are presented to the audience concerning to position of the human race in the galaxy and how far it can go to guarantee self preservation While they are never answered later on they still present some interesting food for thought The last episode is very epic with a nice but quite predictable ending though not all endings should contain numerous outlandish twists of course Again it fits the series br br Gunbuster may sound like your average space opera anime at first with alien invasions huge battles and some personal drama and for the bigger part it is But it is done exceptionally well for a change Instead of going for a steady mix of former elements six episodes long Gunbuster presents us a change from small scale drama to large scale epic heroism Along the way we meet with some various interesting and well fleshed out characters which mutual relationships changing heavily due to the time dilation phenomenon The show is very tightly written although it does tend to slip up at some points Overly dramatic occurrences and too cheesy mecha attacks could have been easily avoided Overall the trip Gunbuster takes you on is a very relaxed sometimes sad sometimes heroic one It might not have shattered the boundaries and limits of the space opera genre but at least it bend them a little Highly enjoyable anime classic but not without flaws br br
Aim For The Top Gunbuster is one of those anime series which has classic written all over it I totally loved this series and to this day it remains my favorite anime And while it was not Gainax s first animated product it was their first OVA series br br Mainly starting out as a parody of the 1970 s sports drama Aim For The Ace Ace O Nerae Gunbuster picks up steam as a serious drama toward the ending of episode 2 when Noriko Takaya is forced to relive the death of her father who was killed in mankind s initial encounter with the insect race Humanity is at war with It is because of her father s death that Noriko wants to become a combat pilot But her lack of confidence proves to get in the way at times and she falters Her friend Kazumi Amano even has doubts about Noriko being chosen as a pilot However Noriko s coach Koichiro Ota has faith in her And he has made it his personal mission to see that she succeeds at becoming a pilot for he was a survivor of the battle in which Noriko s father was killed br br Other characters include Jung Freud a Russian combat pilot assigned to serve with the squadron Noriko and Kazumi belong to Smith Toren a love interest for Noriko who is killed in their first sortie together and Kimiko Higuchi Noriko s childhood friend Kimiko s involvement is also of interest as while Noriko is off in space Kimiko remains behind on Earth to live a normal life And because of the acts of time dilation Kimiko ages normally on Earth while Noriko is relatively the same age as when she left school By the end of the series Noriko is roughly 18 years old while Kimiko is in her mid fifties br br All in all this is an excellent anime series to watch if you are a fan of giant robot mecha and of Gainax animation If you like Hideaki Anno s other shows or are a fan of Haruhiko Mikimoto s artwork then give this show a chance It will grow on you
terribly underrated with matt dillon and tom skerritt good backdrop for solid story and some memorable lines well acted and well cast tommy lee jones and bruce dern make you hate them with passion
Very entertaining and a great cast as noted I d like to add that Bruce Dern did a fine job also as is usually the case Worth renting if you can find it which has proved difficult for me Also note that the Amazon link from this page currently goes to a different movie of the same name
Tommy JOnes and Matt Dillon do the gambling world proud The various moves with the wrists had to be learned as throwing craps is a skill in and of itself br br There are a few surprises AS cynical as we are today I fully expected the good girl to be crying over his grave instead of his Buddy s Especially with her remarks about going to the funeral of her best friend when she first meets Matt And then of course you expect Matt to kill the guy who threw battery acid in Mr Allen s face blinding him interesting role by Bruce Dern WRRROOONNNNGGG some of the other Hollywood endings DO happen but the writing is so excellent the acting so carefully wrought that you re blissfully unaware br br And the music is OUT OF THIS WORLD Taking us back to the 50s when our native passions were first being unleashed by the music of Ray Charles and Bo Diddley Even a little racism raring its ugly head in Chicago but at a club called wonderfully Biloxi with a Confederate flag backing up the racist remarks I ll be watching it again just to hear the music Good thing I have the FACTOTUM sound track so I can listen to that in the car Watch both together and you ll see how Matt has matured playing bar room characters in both NOw that he owns a bar in the Paramount HOtel in NYC he probably has great opportunity to do his studies Great actor just coming into his own He shows finely nuanced performances the good and the bad in his characters His young boy off the farm is a great study made especially poignant because of his bassett hound eyes He makes love convincingly as well Since he was in several movies with Diane Lane as a teen ager I wonder how that it making love to an actress you kinda grew up with Adds conviction I ll say that
Considering the big name cast and lavish production I expected a lot more of this film The acting for the most part is great although the story they have to work with is mediocre at best However the film still warrants watching because of the acting and the stars and some and up and coming young talent
What a surprisingly good movie this one turned out to be This is the type of film that I ve been looking for ages Particularly important for me was the fantastic looking Chicago which I still keep thinking about The back cover doesn t do this film justice it s superb and in my top 5 for sure
Star Trek Hidden Frontier will surprise you in many ways First it s a fan made series available only on the web and it features mainly friends neighbors who have the computer programs and home video cameras and sewing machines to as Mickey Judy once put it put on a show It s definitely friends neighbors to you can tell A lot of these people aren t the most beautiful looking folks you ve ever seen or the youngest or the thinnest some of them stumble through their lines like they re walking on marbles some of them have thick accents or simply don t seem to speak well in the first place whick makes it virtually impossible to understand a single solitary word that they re saying Still you have to admit for everything these friends neighbors have put together it s actually fun to watch Yes some of the dialogue is hokey Yes it s a little odd though admittedly a little cool too watching two Starfleet males kiss although some of the kissing scenes seem to go on and on Yes you cringe a bit when they clearly quote from ST TOS TNG other shows and the movies or when you hear the theme from Galaxy Quest played at the beginning and end of every show Okay We can get by that Why The graphics are first rate Better than almost anything you ve seen And sometimes a show or two really stands out story wise some of them are actually real tear jerkers br br Hidden Frontier is a total guilty pleasure in every sense of the word but you have to give the people involved credit where credit is due It takes a lot of effort to put on a production of this magnitude People sets costumes graphics it s a huge effort on a lot of people s parts We watch we return and we thank them
Hidden Frontiers is more than fan fiction it is well thought out and organized series keeping the worlds of Star Trek alive and growing From a fun little fan project to now a well known net series Hidden Frontiers has a bit of something for every star trek fan in it Set in the Late Star Trek Next Generation DS9 and Voyager time lines Hidden Frontier takes on topics and issues raised in other Star Trek series with set stories using a well developed characters plots and story arcs Star Trek Hidden Frontier has taken on social context stories that Gene Roddenberry failed to bring to the screen and has shown the development of characters in long term space assignments the real things that happen in close quarters as well as an exciting spatial wars and conflicts Sci Fi addicts know and love Done in a Green Screen studio Hidden Frontiers brings a rollicking cast of regulars on to the screen and into your hearts The large ensemble cast of actors plays well together and lovingly gives their time and energy to the project Inventive use of green screen technology props makes up and costumes work to make the Hidden Frontier worlds of Star Trek fun and believable Hidden Frontier has gone where few tread to go in the world of science fiction and thrived once they got there Hidden Frontier offers a wonderful bonus feature of a well thought out website with interesting discussion forums access to creative production and acting staff and a fun weekly chat I highly recommend taking the time to down load and watch
This is short and to the point The story writing used for Star Trek Hidden Frontier is surprisingly good Acting is all over the map but the main characters over the years seem to have worked at improving their skills It is hard to believe that this series has been going on for almost 7 years and will be coming to end mid May 2007 br br I will not rehash what has already been said about the sets and graphics Considering this is all volunteer for no profit it is pretty amazing br br If this was being ranked as a professional production I would have to give it a 5 for a good story but terrible sets However as a fan based production I have to give it an excellent rating as with the exception with a few other efforts this is in a league of its own For sheer volume I don t think this has been matched Congratulations to the cast and crew for an effort that many admire
With the amount of actors they have working on the project they have a wide variety of cast Nice starship CGI in places BUT their green screen needs some work Anyone heard of Adobe After Effects 7 they should buy it get their keying better br br Stories are well thought out plenty of trek elements in this to keep it in the right context BUT BUT the idea of two guys kissing makes me wind forward the episode Im not homophobic but i cant help that i don t find men kissing entertaining dont mind women Anyway For a fan series this is good stuff With minor improvement in their green screen brush up acting and some guidance ratings this series is stunning Anyway i recommend this series to who ever enjoyed TNG and DS9
Hidden Frontier has been talked about and reported on by several news agencies for their long commitment to creating the best Star Trek stories and to providing an example of the togetherness that was Gene Roddenberry s mission Their focus on homosexuality depression war and acceptance of different races is on par or exceeds those of the other Trek series and movies The production value started off as smaller and choppy but over the 7 seasons of production the acting has improved the stories are more complex and the visual graphics have gotten smoother and more impressive In season 6 episode 1 Countermeasures there is one of the biggest space battles in Trek history The ships are rendered well and the space battles are impressive and exciting The real draw to Frontier is not the ships or the backgrounds but it is the people and the interplay and growth of characters There are also nods to other Trek series and movies with places and characters we all know I recommend any Trek fan to check out Countermeasures and you will be hooked
I really like Star Trek Hidden Frontier it is an excellent fan fiction film series and i cant wait to see more I have only started watching this film series last week and i just cannot get enough of it I have already recommended it too other people to watch since it is well worth the view I have already watched each episode many times over and am waiting to see more episodes come out I rated it a ten but i think it deserves a 12 loll My compliments to the staff of the Star Trek Hidden Frontiers on an excellent job If u like Star Trek i highly recommend checking out this star trek fan fiction film The detail associated with this series of films is excellent especially the ships and planets used in it
Okay so the first few seasons took a while to get going on the special effects way but from the beginning Hidden Frontier has given consistently good story lines and performances and have always been willing to mistakes they ve made They advice people to see newer episodes first so they can see just how good the show is and understand how much it has changed since the first episodes The cast have a fantastic camaraderie and it shows on screen br br The influx of guest actors who make their mark on the show and with fans attests also to the show as the story lines go from strength to strength The show has pushed barriers with its various story lines depression drug addiction and mainstream homosexuality and these may have rubbed a few people the wrong way but that is what Star Trek is and was all about It portrays those story lines in a smart and emotional way dealing with them subtly and smoothly br br Yes they have used some characters from Trek history but they have done them justice characters like Shelby Lefler and Necheyev vastly underused in the show had a rebirth in the New Frontier books but they lost their sizzle after a while when Peter David when more towards wild fantasy versus serious sci fi and HF shows those characters in a completely different light which serves them better br br The site also allows fans to interact with chat rooms and forums and they can get to know the people involved They release bloopers for every episode so the fans can see what a laugh they have because they are people doing it in their spare time with a dedication that would make many professional actors wide eyed in shock br br What this series now drawing to a close after 7 years has accomplished on such a limited amount of resources is nothing short of amazing bringing people together inspiring others to do the same HF will live for a long time after it ends as long as people still enjoy the reason it started in the first place
I kind of consider myself as the 1 fan of Hidden Frontier seeing as I am among a somewhat small group of fans who have actually met most of these guys well not counting conventions of course I have been watching Hidden Frontier since 2001 and I must say I continue to be impressed by what these guys have come up with br br Hidden Frontier is the brainchild of Rob Caves and his self made studio Areakt Pictures which operates out of the back room of his house While not as fancy as say the TOS based series New Voyages which sometimes gets some of the actors writers from the original series like Walter Koenig aka Mr Chekov Rob and the cast and crew of HF manage to create a series worthy of replacing that ghastly experiment we called Enterprise The most controversial and successful story arc has been the introduction of Star Trek s first openly gay character Corey Aster who was introduced in the second season and his search to find a soul mate Somewhere later in the series he meets Jorian Zen the Excelsior s Trill helm officer In the recent story lines with these two characters WARNING MAJOR SPOILER Do not read if you have not watched the series up to this point Zen is joined to an exiled symbiont causing a great deal of change and some conflict in his relationship with Aster Though the future is uncertain seeing as the most recent episode Beachhead was just shown to HF fans in the chat room last night I think that this relationship will endure but only time will tell br br Gene Roddenberry created Star Trek with the intention that the story be more about his characters rather than flashy space battles Rob Caves created Hidden Frontier for that same reason and this is what has made this series as popular as it is As the previous comment stated I wish I could give it a rating higher than 10 but it will have to suffice Although next season will be the last keeping in the tradition of seven season shows started by Star Trek The Next Generation I am willing to bet that we will hear much about Hidden Frontier after that final episode
This is a brilliant and well made contribution by a group of fans and considering it s made in a back bedroom on a painted green screen it s story lines are complex and twisting and it s characters show realistic depth and dimension The CGI created by the crew is breathtaking While it s first season might be a little shaky it s final few are well thought out and well shot Some fans might have thought that the Star Trek Franchise had come to an end with the early cancellation of Enterprise but these fans don t take no for an answer I recommend this to fans and newcomers alike 10 10 hidden frontier crew br br Make it so
Nicely done and along with New voyages it s a great continuation Fab to see James Cawley in the latest episode Vigil Check it out br br I like the growing characterisation and think we have good replacements for the TV actors in a fan produced piece This show manages to capture the feel quite well as they state on the ste it has improved over the years with experience and I hope with some more experience a strong script editor and a pick up in timing and CGI that HF will becoming more remarkable than it already truly is br br Good work to all concerned br br I have a HUGE soft spot for Lefler McFarland GREAT acting although I m a bit tired of Lefler s laws ENOUGH already Shelby s great if a little uptight and it s cool she got the ship Commodore Ian s nice like Fred Flintstone but lacks the gritty edge of a commanding officer and does seem too pleased with himself The Doc Counselor and Rawlins are right on the money in my eyes as is the WONDERFUL Nechayev what a beautiful accent a REAL Russian Well I m guessing Rene hails from the Czech Rep br br It gets my vote and the CGI is kewl Some of the greenscreen s obvious but on a small budget whaddayagonndo br br Really glad I found it br br OK some of the acting isn t great but it s fan made and is therefore allowed to be variable sorry Cmm Cole br br The gay material is layed on too thick Graham Norton d be embarrassed Trek doesn t pay that much attention to hetero couples so why signpost gays with all the snogging It s not necessary to showpiece someone s sexuality to this extent I hope they tone it down let Aster Zen be people not tokens I don t treat my gay friends any differently They re just regular guys br br Musically it s a mixed bag I can tell its all stock Trek OST stuff and works most of the time but timing can fall flat now then the end of Worst Fears Part 2 misses the crunch and the edit Love the fact they use the Galaxy Quest music br br I certainly can t wait for more Dazza br br Never give up never surender br br Viva les frontieres
For the record I am not affiliated with the production in any way br br Hidden Frontier is probably the Star Trek fan film with the most episodes produced to date Over 7 seasons this is the last they have produced some 50 or so episodes br br This is no mean feat on almost no budget and everyone volunteering their time and energy br br By their own admission the earlier seasons do not have as good production qualities as later ones but as they progress the effects green screen work and acting all improve br br I did find it difficult to dip into so started from the beginning and watched all the way through HF benefits from story arcs just like all the best sci fi and dovetails nicely into the Star Trek universe in which it is set Characters and relatives from the original series have been brought into the stories and add a lot to the feel of the stories sometimes improving on the characters over the original br br The whole experience includes an excellent web site blooper reels a high membership forum which is frequented by many of the actors and production staff and a weekly chat br br If you are looking for high definition high budget productions this is probably not for you br br If you are looking for continued adventures in the Star Trek universe with stories that does Star Trek credit and makes you think this is the one
Star Trek Hidden Frontier is a long running internet only fan film done completely for the love of the series and a must watch for fans of Trek The production quality is extremely high for a fan film although sometimes you can tell that they re green screenin it This doesn t take away from the overall experience however The CGI ships are fantastic as well as the space battle scenes On the negative side I could tell in the earlier episodes and even occasionally in the newer ones that some of the actors actresses are not quite comfortable in their roles but once again this doesn t take away from the overall experience of new interpretations of Star Trek The cast and crew have truly come up with something special here and as a whole I would highly recommend this series to fans of The Next Generation and Deep Space 9
Hidden Frontier is a fan made show in the world of Star Trek The story takes place after Voyager has returned from the Delta quadrant It has some characters from the official Star Trek shows but most of them are original to the show The show takes place on the star base Deep Space 12 and on several space ships which gives it opportunities the official shows don t have The characters have the opportunity of a rising in the hierarchy which characters in shows with only one ship doesn t have The show has good computer animation of spaceships but the acting takes place in front of at green screen and it gives a green glow around the actors Not all the actors are equally good but most do fine The episodes are character driven and the characters develop over many episodes That is a bit more like in Babylon 5 than in most official Star Trek shows Hidden Frontier takes taboos that even the official series has shrunk from using All in all I enjoyed watching it
Hidden Frontier is notable for being the longest running internet based Star Trek fan series While the production quality is not on a par with fan productions like Starship Exeter or New Voyages Hidden Frontier concentrates largely on story and in that regard it does very well indeed br br Hidden Frontier has no physical sets instead actors are filmed against a greenscreen and the backgrounds inserted digitally One of Hidden Frontier s greatest achievements is the sheer volume of work they have produced One of the ways in which this is achieved is by inserting the virtual sets at the time of filming instead of in post production While this does save a great deal of time it s also worth noting that the quality of the resultant footage is not as high as if it had been produced in post production though it still serves its purpose br br While it may not be everyone s cup of tea Hidden Frontier is well worth a shot though you might be best to start off watching the third season since this is where the producers really start to hit their stride
Low budget Brit pop melodrama focuses on a girl who wants to be a star becomes one and then finds it all a bit too much Good cast and a sense of time and place cannot hide the fact that we have all been here before Several scenes are a bit hysterical and O Connor s voice sounds a lot like Mini Mouse She disappeared from sight soon after making this movie so life can imitated art A must see if you want to see a punk version of a Star Is Born though
I acquired this one of my all time favourite films on DVD recently and as usual during viewing the whole thing just blew me away br br I am a massive fan of Hazel O Connor and the soundtrack to this film just has me in tears especially the Will You track It s a pure nostalgia trip for me back to my youth This rates second best to Quadrophenia which also starred Phil Daniels br br A great soundtrack and a great view of Britain in the Thatcherite years of the grim 80 s in which I grew up The ending is so sad for hours after the end of the film I am like a blubbering baby br br I expect to wear out this DVD from repeated viewing I can watch it over and over again and never be bored simply for the soundtrack alone br br Hazel sorry to hear about your dad darling God Bless you all xx
Anyone interested in pop music and not familiar with British music trends of the late seventies should be sure to watch Breaking Glass at least once The movie about a young woman s quest to make her mark in the music world captures the times perfectly from the overt sexism rough economic times social upheaval to the shift in pop culture from rough and tumble punk to terribly fey and pretentious Futurism New Romanticism The music and fashion styles created daily in Britain in the late seventies are still being rediscovered and recycled there really has been nothing new since 1980 This was a dazzling time and Breaking Glass both tells a very personal story and surveys the cultural landscape and does both extremely well
I first saw Breaking Glass when it was released in England in 1980 I loved it then and having just caught it in August 2005 on a Canadian station it still is great The only thing I regret is I can t find the sound track or the DVD in the stores anyone care to shed some light or must I order it from some over priced internet company But getting back to the film the music stands up to the test of time Hazel Kate had something to say about 80 s Britain actually it was the same decade I moved to Canada for some of the same reasons one being Thatcher and what she was doing to the country at the time Please if you get the chance watch this movie you won t be sorry
One of my best films ever maybe because i was well into the punk scene in the late 70s and went to many of hazels concerts but the film was a good story line and very good acting by hazel and a up and coming Phil Daniels not sure about his latest project Eastenders excellent performance by lots of unknown actors who if you keep your eyes peeled will see them in many of the UK soaps today exp Carver out of the Bill the more i watch it the more of them i spot well if you have not seen it yet have a night in with the video don t forget to dig out the safety pin for your nose and heavy black eye makeup and shave your head Mochanian style Enjoy
I first saw Breaking Glass in 1980 and thought that it would be one of the Movie Classics This film is a great look into the music industry with a great cast of performers This is one film that should be in the collection of everyone and any one that wants to get into the music industry I can t wait for it to be available on DVD
Breaking Glass is a film that everyone aspiring to be in the music industry should see more than once It is a very dark tale about the way a record company manipulates a singer to do things their way and to make as much money out of her as possible Looking at some of today s search for a star style TV shows on both in the UK and abroad I am always reminded of this film Though not an expert on the subject the winners of these shows tend to have one very big initial hit and then its downhill from there This film predates these shows though the effect seems the same After getting rid of her manager played quite brilliantly by Phil Daniels slowly but surely the record company changes her lyrics puts her on stimulants and she is eventually totally burnt out You potential stars of tomorrow WATCH THIS AND BEWARE
I first saw the film when it landed on US cable a year after it came out It blew my little head away I was only 16 and it was the first new wave music I d heard having been a strictly folky classical kid growing up The music mesmerized me as did Hazel O Connor s amazing look and charismatic vocal performances and Phil Daniels tough but soft Cockney manager just stole my heart But I think my favorite character was Jonathan Pryce s drugged out sax player He was so out of place in the band and so harmless and pathetic he just begged for sympathy Favorite scenes the performance when the lights went out and the love scene on the train br br Okay so the movie isn t the Rose But it was really excellent for its limited budget and for its portrayal of the Britain of the early 80 s exploding with rebellious youth looking for a way out of the dole queue I went to Britain only a couple of years later and found the movie to have been very reflective of the atmosphere I found when I was there br br If you get a chance to see it It is a great movie with some wonderful performances and the music will blow you away br br
Illudere to delude comes from Latin verb ludere to play so you re warned about the spy game as a cruel and yet elaborate and intelligent activity stemmin from a complex and as it may appear absurd and vain personal history whatever it may be and yet I feel fascinated by the mechanism of treason and loyalty the raw material of any relationship from the personal to the social after many years ago I was ABLE to finish the book it was a revelation At the beginning I was so bored if not for the surprising style of the writing I really started to LOVE Le Carre after that novel The main character is not wavering at all he has made a choice to redeem his weakness by following the path of faith to friendship and love or is he not After this novel you can clearly understand the darker version of Green s Our Man in Havana wrote by LeCarre with The Tailor of Panama there is no game left there it ends either in tragedy or in a grotesque comical way or both There is no Smiley here to upheld decent human qualities in the service or at least there is no point to introduce him in this case The BBC has done a superb work with these series from LeCarre s novels the actors are excellent as are the locations and sets of course the script here is brilliantly adapted Be warned though even if someone may find it laughable the after taste IS bitter
I have just watched the whole 6 episodes on DVD The acting throughout is excellent no question There was not quite enough action for me I must say No real suspense as such just plenty of first class character development Nothing like Tinker Tailor in terms of whodunnit If you like a good story slowly and carefully told then this is for you Peter Egan as the lead Magnus Pym is excellent br br The film portrayed the life of a traitor A man who should have been a loyal member of the British Intelligence Service but who was so damaged psychologically by his unhappy childhood that deception became his way of life in all things As a child he adored his father but his father was exposed time time again as a crook and a con man Pym betrayed not for ideology or money but because he needed to deceive those closest to him wife son mentor Pym is fatally damaged by his father s influence it has eaten his moral fibre away He has no real love or loyalty in him br br Heavy psychological stuff and not many light moments in the 6 hour series Very well done though
Having just seen the A Perfect Spy mini series in one go one can do nothing but doff one s hat a pure masterpiece which compared to the other Le Carr√© minis about Smiley has quite different qualities br br In the minis about Smiley it is Alex Guiness as Smiley who steals the show the rest of the actors just support him one can say br br Here it is ensemble and story that s important as the lead actor played excellently by Peter Egan in the final episodes isn t charismatic at all br br Egan just plays a guy called Magnus Pym who by lying being devious and telling people what they like to hear is very well liked by everyone big and small The only one who seems to understand his inner self is Alex his Czech handler br br Never have the machinery behind a spy and or traitor been told better After having followed his life from a very young age we fully understand what it is that makes it possible to turn him into a traitor His ability to lie and fake everything is what makes him into a perfect spy as his Czech handler calls him br br And by following his life we fully understand how difficult it is to get back to the straight and narrow path once you ve veered off it He trundles on even if he never get anything economic out of it except promotion by his MI5 spy masters Everyone s happy as long as the flow of faked information continues br br Magnus s father played wonderfully by Ray McAnally is a no good con man who always dreams up schemes to con people out of their money In later years it is his son who has to bail him out again and again But by the example set by his dad and uncle who takes over as guardian when his father goes to prison and his mom is sent off to an asylum Magnus quickly learns early that lying is the way of surviving not telling the truth At first he overdoes it a bit but quickly learn to tell the right lies and to be constant not changing the stories from time to time that he tell those who want to listen about himself and his dad br br His Czech handler Alex expertly played by R√ºdiger Weigang creates with the help of Magnus a network of non existing informants which supplies the British MI5 with fake information for years and years just as the British did with the German spies that were active in the UK before and during the war they kept on sending fake information to Das Vaterland long after the agents themselves had been turned liquidated or simply been replaced by MI5 men br br The young lads who play Magnus in younger years does it wonderfully and most of them are more charismatic than the older little more cynic and tired Pym played by Egan But you buy the difference easily as that is often the way we change through life from enthusiasm to sorrow or indifference br br Indeed well worth the money
As a fan of author John le Carre I ve slowly been working my way through both his books and the adaptations of them I found this 1987 adaptation of le Carre s masterwork at my local library and sat down to watch it thinking I would know what to expect I was surprised to discover that my expectations were exceeded in this miniseries a fine cross between a spy thriller and a human drama br br Peter Egan gives a great performance as Magnus Pym the perfect spy of the title Carrying on in the long tradition of le Carre s strong main characters Pym is also quite possibly the best Egan plays Pym who in fact contains many shades of author le Carre as a man forced to spend his entire life lying and betraying sometimes out of circumstance and other times just to survive with the consequence of him becoming a perfect spy Egan plays Pym to perfection as a man always on the run if not from others then from himself Egan alone makes the six or so hours of this miniseries worth seeing from his performance alone br br Surronding Egan is a fantastic supporting cast Ray McAnally gives one of his finest performances as Pym s con man father Rick who as le Carre has said is based strongly on the author s own father McAnally plays a man who comes in and out of Pym s life and is one of the those responsible for Pym becoming a perfect spy In fact if it wasn t for McAnally s performance a year after this in A Very British Coup this would the finest performance of his sadly too short career br br The rest of the supporting is excellent as well From Caroline John as Pym s mother to Alan Howard as his spy mentor to R√ºdiger Weigang as the young Pym s friend turned controller to Jane Booker as Pym s wife the supporting cast is fantastic Special mention should be made of the three young actors who played the younger Pym Jonathan Haley Nicholas Haley and Benedict Taylor who establish the young man who would become the man played so well By Peter Egan br br The production values of the miniseries are strong as well As the miniseries adaptations of Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy and Smiley s People proved these stories can only be told in miniseries format The locations are excellent from the English locations to the those scattered across Eastern Europe and the USA as are the sets by Chris Edwards The cinematography of Elmer Cossey adds an extra layer of realism to the world of the miniseries Yet the highlight of the miniseries is really the script br br Screenwrtier Arthur Hopcraft tackled the job of adapting the six hundred or so page novel excellently The novel was largely at least in its early parts autobiographical in that Pym s early life echoed much of John le Carre s life The script for this miniseries is no exception as it traces the development of Magnus Pym from young boy to a perfect spy Never once does the miniseries deviate from its purpose of telling a fine human drama in the context of the world of espionage If one ever wants proof that a spy thriller can be tense and fascinating without ever having one gun fight fist fight or James Bond style car chase this would be the proof While the miniseries is six plus hours long it never wastes a moment and it all the better for it br br Though it might be overlong for some for those who don t have very short attention spans here is a must see From the performances of Peter Egan and Ray McAnally to fine production values and a fine literary script A Perfect Spy is one of the finest miniseries who can expect to see It is a fascinating trip down the history of the Cold War yet it is more then that It is also a trip down what John le Carre has called the secret path the path of the spy the man who must lie and betray to survive As much a human drama as a spy thriller A Perfect Spy isn t to be missed
This is my second time through for A Perfect Spy I watched it 2 or 3 years ago and liked it I like it still It s natural that it gets compared to the beeb s other big Le Carre series Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy Tinker Tailor focuses on the game spies play Perfect Spy gives us the other axis what kind of person a spy is There are a number of themes that these movies share along with others in the genre br br Ambiguity moral sexual interpersonal which creates a multidimensional space of true vs false inside vs outside love vs responsibility In a way these characters are happiest when they are being treated the most shabbily by those they love and respect backstabbed in its various nuances br br The theme of fathers and father figures is also important One of the most intriguing characters in A Perfect Spy is Rick the main character Magnus perhaps ersatz father Throughout the story he betrays and is betrayed A rogue who always manages to climb back up the ladder when he s been toppled who seems impervious to what others think of him asks Magnus each time they meet Do you love your old man and never Do you love me Maybe it says this somewhere else but A Perfect Spy is a love story br br Another theme is that of malignancy The nature of the business is to turn others turn them against their government against their friends and associates turn them against their values and beliefs In each of the Le Carre movies I have seen The Spy who Came in From the Cold Looking Glass War Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy Smiley s People and A Perfect Spy turning and being turned is the foundation of the tragedy br br Finally not so much a theme as an artistic touch in each of these films there is usually only a single gun shot or perhaps two shots bookending the story Violence torture cruelty are always just beneath the surface We see their results not as streams of blood or dank prison cells but in the the objects Le Carre s characters cling to as they are ineluctably sucked down into the morass br br If you haven t seen the films above and you enjoy A Perfect Spy you are in for a treat I d also recommend The Sandbagger series Yorkshire TV the 2nd and 3rd seasons of which begin to reach the level of this kind of complexity The IPCRESS File and Burial in Berlin are nice though light weight For political intrigue try A Very British Coup House of Cards and Yes Minister Yes Prime Minister br br If only a brit would set his hand to making The Three Kingdoms there would be a film with intrigue and complexity
This is an extremely long movie which means you may become very bored before it becomes interesting but its length provides opportunity for its characters to find permanent attachment in your sympathies br br If you are moved by the guilt of the loathsome you will find it particularly heart wrenching because it is a story that finds its heroes among the evil and the weak If you can love a monster you ll cry for Magnus Pym the spy who betrays everyone notably his country his friends and family a man who has also been manipulated and moulded since childhood by those same people br br There isn t one truly likeable character in the entire story not one loyal moral personality to sympathise with But watching the whole thing without the help of a tissue would be quite remarkable br br I really enjoyed it in the end Well worth it for people who like inciteful movies about baser human character
It s been a long time since I saw this mini series and I am happy to say its remembered merits have withstood the test of time br br Most of the components of A Perfect Spy the adaptation of LeCarr√© s finest novel in my opinion are top drawer Outstanding aspects of it are the musical score and the masterful screenplay the latter written by Arthur Hopcraft who was also I believe the screenwriter for Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy with Alec Guinness a few years before br br The actors are mostly very good some superb like Alan Howard s Jack Brotherhood and Ray McAnally s Ricky Pym Peter Egan is fascinating to watch because his face changes with every camera angle The passage of time and the effects upon the physical appearances of the characters is very believably done So much so that I wondered exactly how old Peter Egan was at the time of filming The only jolt comes after the character of Magnus Pym is transferred from the very able hands of a young actor named Benedict Taylor to those of a noticeably too old Peter Egan just fresh out of Oxford But this is a minor and unimportant seam in the whole br br Egan has trouble being convincing only when the text becomes melodramatic and he needs to be upset emotionally ie cry None of the actors have a very easy time with these moments aside from the wonderful Frances Tomelty who plays Peggy Wentworth for all she s worth and steals the episode with ease br br Jane Booker is annoying as Mary Pym She has part of the character under her skin but often displays an amateurish petulance that diminishes her as a tough cookie diplomatic housewife which Mary Pym is R√ºdiger Weigang is splendid as Axel amusing ironic and brilliant I also enjoyed Sarah Badel s camp turn as the Baroness br br The British view of Americans is vividly rendered in some dryly hilarious scenes When the Yanks have come abroad to confab with Bo Brammell head of MI6 the American contingent are portrayed as empty headed buffoons who appear to have memorized a lot of long words out of the Dictionary and spiced them liberally with American jargon and psycho babble much to the bemused scorn of the English br br The humor and sadness are subtly blended LeCarr√© has a knack for mixing disparate elements in his stories and Hopcraft has brilliantly captured the melancholy yet wistful atmosphere of the original br br Not a perfect production what is and yet the best of the LeCarr√© adaptations to reach film or television to date br br Highly recommended to all spy thriller lovers and especially LeCarr√© fans DVD available from Acorn
This is without doubt my favourite Le Carre novel and it is transformed to the silver screen with all the love and care one could wish for I read a review on this site that seems to find the characters loathsome but I believe this misses the point All Le Carre stories are essentially love stories and this is no exception It is an accurate reflection of the period in which it is set Betrayal is the key by everybody for the good of nobody Pym upbringing is so close to my own that I find it chilling watching Peter Egan is in his finest role and the late lamented Ray McAnally is unbelievably good Even the smallest roles played by such as Andy de la Tour Tim Healy and Jack Ellis are spot on This cast is a Theatre Impresario s Dream The Story should not be spoiled by ill informed description but suffice it to say it relates to a young mans slow but inexorable destruction and descent into espionage and treason All my sympathies lie with Magnus Pym and his sole non sexual love for Poppy R√ºdiger Weigang as wonderful as always His only true friendship but also by definition another in the long line of betrayals OUTSTANDING Rent it buy it love it
Without doubt the best of the novels of John Le Carre exquisitely transformed into a classic film Performances by Peter Egan Magnus Pym The Perfect Spy Rudiger Weigang Axel real name Alexander Hampel Magnus Czech Intelligence controller Ray McAnally Magnus con man father and Alan Howard Jack Brotherhood Magnus mentor believer and British controller together with the rest of the characters are so perfect and natural the person responsible for casting them should have been given an award Even the small parts such as Major Membury are performed to perfection It says a lot for the power of the performances and the strength of the characters in the novel that despite the duplicity of Magnus one cannot help but feel closer to Magnus and Axel than to Jack Brotherhood and the slimy Grant Lederer of U S Intelligence I have read the book at least a dozen times and watched the movie almost as many times and continue to be mesmerized by both If I had one book to take on a desert island A Perfect Spy would be the choice above all others
Erotic cinema of the 1970 s was tame compared to the triple X romps of today which is good Because there is a good story around the naked rituals and sex scenes Of course I wish that they had some vampire effects which they had at the time period and the sex did get in the way of the story a little Plus some of the accents were hard to understand at time periods but it s worth watching the unedited version then the edited up version which is titled THE DEVIL S PLAYTHING But if you don t care for allot of naked women dancing and having sex then this isn t the movie for you However I did enjoy it and I give it 7 STARS
Spoilers Classic 70 s sex trash The Swedish gal Helga was what made this movie so great She was beautiful but what really got to me was how sexual she was She exuded massive quantities of sexuality throughout the film Her best scenes were when she was er stimulating herself Whenever she was on screen I became transfixed br br Also the Doctor Julia sister of the dimwitted male focus of the film was very interesting visually Although most 12 year old girls have bigger breasts than Julia she knew how to use what little she had and her scenes especially the scenes with the silk blouse and black skirt also grabbed my attention unmercilessly You also got to love the major hoaky scene where the bats stripped her nekkid I don t know if I ve ever seen anything more ludicrous yet sexy at the same time Classic stuff
Well if you are looking for a great mind control movie this is it No movie has had so many gorgeous women under mind control and naked Marie Forsa as the busty Helga is under just about everytime she falls asleep and a few times when she isn t One wishes they made more movies like this one
Well the story is a little hard to follow the first time but that s only because of all the bare breasted 70s painted up vampire witches dancing to the bongo drums This of course interrupted by a few vampiric orgies And there are some very interesting candles and uses for them And for girl on girl action vampiric or not this movie just rocks
This masterpiece of lesbian horror comes from exploitation master Joseph W Sarno It features plenty of soft core sex really hot lesbian sequences plus a lot of naked women The acting is pretty good and the film is quite atmospheric and well made Marie Forsa is one of the hottest chicks I have ever seen in a horror movie it s a visual pleasure to see her wonderful body Sarno really knows how to pick up hot looking ladies A must see for fans of sexploitation
THE DEVIL S PLAYTHING is my second attempt at a Joseph Sarno production and although I will say it is far more enjoyable than the painfully dull and unerotic Swedish WILDCATS it is still a little slow and un explicit for my taste br br This one centers around a group of vampire girls who live in a castle that want to resurrect their previously murdered leader In order to do so the girls have to dance around naked and kiss each other and chant weird stuff and of course drink some blood too When a doctor and her brother s car breaks down and they have to stop at the castle for lodging they provide the ideal bloodbank for the horny vampires but they may not be as helpless as they seem br br THE DEVIL S PLAYTHING is a pretty good example of early 70 s exploit sleaze Lots of nudity including some full frontal some sleazy undertones including incest and of course lesbo bloodsucking but these scenes are still pretty tame by today s standards Some pretty hot women in this one would have benefited from some more explicit sex but I guess ya can t have it all Also would have benefited from some heavier violence gore being that it IS a vampire film but I think the purpose of THE DEVIL S PLAYTHING was more to showcase skin not blood Still a little slow and the acting for the most part is absolutely wooden but that s to be expected from something from this era and of this budget Worth a look to exploit fans others may find it a little too dull for their liking 7 10
This is an excellent show I had a US history teacher in high school that was much like this There are many facts in history that are not quite true and Mr Wuhl points them out very well in a way that is unforgettable br br Mr Wuhl is teaching a class of film students but history students and even the general public will appreciate the witty way that he uncovers some very well known fallacies in the history of the world and strive to impress them upon that brains of his students Use of live actors performing skits is also very entertaining br br I highly recommend this series to anyone interested in having the history they learned as a child turned upside down
this was one of the funniest and informative shows that I have ever seen This is a MUST see for anyone over the age of 16 this show had me and my 2 boys laughing out loud from the beginning I don t know if everything on the show was true but the way it was presented left little doubt that Mr Wuhl was not only very knowledgeable but he also had a blast presenting this information to the very lucky college kids who were in attendance If Mr Wuhl ever decides to do this format again they will have to rent a building the size of the Georgia Dome to hold all the people who will want to see it I agree with the idea of making this a HBO series It would have an amazing following
I never really knew who Robert Wuhl was before seeing this But after seeing it I realized what a funny man he is This HBO special features him teaching American history to New York university film students and the man was just phenomenal He poked fun at almost every key historic event that occurred not just in the U S but some other parts of the world This documentary comedy was a great satire that made me question if what I accept as the infallible true history is really true br br I enjoyed how Mr Wuhl managed to mix useful information with great comedy and made learning a lot more exciting I would recommend this to anyone interested in history and is willing to question what his her beliefs
I recently watched this but when it started I had no idea what the concept was about what the topic was in short I had no idea what it was Was it a documentary was it a comedy routine Well it was BOTH br br It started a little slow but I think that s because I had absolutely no idea what type of program I was viewing But it quickly sucked me in The episode I watched had Robert Wuhl discussing fact and fiction in history Mainly how we american s learn history that isn t really true and how we got to learn what we did He did this in such a way as to keep the viewer completely entertained and interested I actually learned a few things and that is a true indicator of how effective this type of program can be br br I would love to see this picked up as a series for HBO I believe it can be just as fun and effective with a variety of topics especially if they are taught in the same type of manner as this episode
Robert Wuhl is teaching a class of film students at New York University in Manhattan New York br br He covers fallacies of history and truths that are no longer generally known I would like to see much more of this show It is very entertaining Mr Wuhl uses examples and show and tell to get his points across He explained that the person who actually rode the Midnight Ride of Paul Revere was not Paul Revere Henry Wadsworth Longfellow used Revere s name because it sounded better br br I ve watched Robert Wuhl for many years from the time he was doing stand up comedy and all the way through Arli on HBO He s a good actor and a good stand up comedian but he s an excellent teacher I highly recommend that you watch an episode of this show It is well worth your time
Jane Porter s former love interest Harry Holt Neil Hamilton and his friend Martin Paul Cavanagh come to Tarzan s hidden away jungle escarpment searching for the ivory gold mine that is the Elephant s Graveyard first seen in TARZAN THE APE MAN only we soon discover both men have hidden intentions namely Jane Will Tarzan stand for that Not likely in fact Tarzan won t even stand for any disturbance done to the Elephant s Graveyard and knowing this Martin attempts to take Tarzan out of the picture only he later finds himself in a world of trouble later he and his party including Jane who leaves with them after she believes Tarzan is dead is captured by a native tribe intent on feeding them to the lions will Tarzan be will and able enough to get to them in time br br This film is adventure filled with loads of scenes involving Tarzan and other facing down wild animals and a climax that grips the viewer s interest and doesn t let up The cruelty displayed towards animals and the portrayal of native people may disturb some today but all should remember this is basically fantasy adventure entertainment and shouldn t be taken so seriously
Ever wanted to know just how much Hollywood could get away with before the Hayes Code was officially put into effect Well unfortunately Convention City is lost so well just have to watch Tarzan and His Mate to find out For 1934 there is a remarkable amount of sexual innuendo and even exposed flesh Just look at Jane s nude swim While Tarzan is often thought of as b adventure films made for young boys and no one else this picture proves that the series was originally very adult Over seventy years later it is still as sexy as it was when it came out br br In addition to the envelope pushing taboo nature it is a superb and exciting adventure story I ve always enjoyed the jungle films that Hollywood churned out in the 30s and the 40s but there are few from the genre I d call great films Tarzan and His Mate is by far the best film from this long gone subgenre The sequences of the attacks on the safari by either apes or natives still manage to create tension today Also the animals are all too cool espescially the apes throwing boulders The acting won t win any major awards soon but is certainly more than adequate for this type of picture The film is once again stolen by Cheetah the smartest monkey in the jungle One of the most entertaining examples of pre code Hollywood out there
Make no mistake Maureen O Sullivan is easily the most gorgeous Jane ever and there will never be one more gorgeous She is visually stunning That aside it takes more than a beautiful woman to make a good film This is a great film It not only has the classic Tarzan aura but also the feel of the continuing saga We become involved with the two white hunters who search for ivory one of them in love with Jane the other a roguish catalyst whose character may be one of the best defined and best examined in movie history And these characterizations are what make this great action flick stand out as a classic There is the uncomfortable racism which is depicted However the Africans are depicted as individuals and at the end two even become more heroic than the white hunters and stand out as such In fact the one not named evokes probably more sympathy from the audience than any other characters The finale also is one of the reasons to enjoy this movie The great lion attack has never been duplicated and the horror is well implied with character reactions more so than a modern gore movie would do with graphic depiction If I left anything out it is because I do not want to soil the picture for those who haven t seen it But it is everything you could want in a movie
Tarzan and his mate 1934 was the only Tarzan movie I didn t see when I was a kid It sounded boring Now I have seen it I have seen the ape man 1932 about a hundred times and I keep a copy on my drive It s a remarkable movie It s almost flawless Tarzan and his mate 1934 however falters It s not harmonic and it s parts tend to live a life of there own The parts themselves are often very good and the action sequences are great Big budget expensive Tarzan himself is co starring Jane dominates She have developed and have become a jungle girl so sexy I tend to forget about criticism and sing her praise instead Well She let her be duped by a crock who steels a kiss from her and later murder an elephant She insists Tarzan to carry a bracelet who belonged to her father Forever The thing would split to pieces the moment he went about his businesses in the jungle Stupid Later someone founds it in the river Well it s supposed to proof Tarzan is dead Some cheap drama The crocks who has an obvious interest in a dead Tarzan convince Jane that he is gone She takes their words for granted and want to be taken away to England Stupid Jane seems to have forgot how tough Tarzan is how hard he is to kill The caravan is leaving and Jane go along Again a pothole She could easily make the caravan rest for a few hours or more to pick up a few things and say goodbye to the jungle and her dead husband She could be smart She could dive where they found the floating bracelet check the banks for traces She can make fire in 15 seconds and swing in Liana s Picking up traces shouldn t be too hard for jungle Jane She could talk to the apes and so on If she get home to England without have done this she would become miserable Jane is smart but cheap drama brings her down And why on earth is she letting the kiss rapist get away with I blame myself as much as you A punishment for being vane perhaps Nonsense Struggle a hard slap and telling Tarzan would be appropriate Still This movie is far from bad even if the potholes are many and sometimes deep Just lean back and enjoy It s Tarzan and Jane for God sake

One of the best Tarzan films is also one of its most action packed and graphic br br Picking up a year or so after Tarzan the Ape Man Niel Hamilton s Holt has asked a rich friend to finance a safari back to the elephants graveyard to collect ivory His Friend arrives also carrying dresses and perfumes that Holt hopes to use to win Jane back from Tarzan Before they can leave Holt finds his map stolen and it becomes a mad dash to try and capture a competing expedition When they finally over take the thieves they find the whole party dead and themselves surrounded They have no choice but to fight their way out and soon find they are out of the frying pan and into the fire Eventually Tarzan and Jane show up and everyone is off on even more adventures br br Infamous film was heavily censored to reduce the graphic violence Its graphic even by todays standards It probably would get a PG 13 and to remove all hint of nudity there is a several minute long nude swim scene involving Jane that is full frontal in its nudity it was only recently restored Its clear watching the restored version why this film was reduced by 20 minutes in its run time for TV As it stands in its restored version this is a very adult film that is romantic touching action filled and everything else that a movie should be Its an amazing film by almost any standard Best of all its the sort of film that plays well both as a stand alone adventure one need not to have seen the first film to enjoy it but its also a film that deepens the characters and themes that were set up in that original film Its an amazing thing br br I really like this film a great deal br br If there are any flaws to the film its perhaps that the film hasn t aged well The rear screen is often very obvious there are gorilla suits for many of the apes and some of the other effects are more quaint rather than convincing However on almost every other level this film is top notch br br You really owe it to yourself to see this Make yourself a big bowl of popcorn and curl up on the couch and just let yourself drift back to a simpler time This is one of the great adventures
I have the entire Weissmuller Tarzan series on DVD fully restored editions I never tire of watching them My personal favorite is Tarzan and His Mate due entirely well almost entirely to Maureen O Sullivan s costume and the occasional flashes of her genital area beneath that leather flap hanging in front Before anyone claims that A It wasn t really her or B It wasn t really what it looks like let me say that I have watched it numerous time in high zoom mode and trust me it IS her AND she is completely naked underneath that costume several times especially during the lion attack at the end careful viewing in slow motion and maximum zoom will reveal that she was shaved except for a tiny patch of dark hair covering her labia There is NO mistake about that at all As to the swimming scene being a body double in a skin suit yes it is a double BUT she is NOT wearing any skin suit or anything else again slow motion and maximum zoom shows everything to those who want to see it Now that controversy out of the way let s move on the actual movie I thought the script was really well thought out and written tightly The action sequences were simply great although it is obviously a stuntman riding the rhino Weissmuller actually wrestles the big male lion The use of background shots that were second unit stuff from Africa is very well blended with the studio US locations making it sometimes hard to tell which is which Don t complain too much though remember that 90 of ALL films is phony anyway so just relax and enjoy the damned thing with a big bowl of popcorn some cold beer and a fresh pack of smokes a sexy and willing girlfriend wife isn t out of line either lol Oh One final word about nudity at the very beginning while the white hunters are speaking dialogue keep your eyes on the background extras there are several good shots of nude African girls obviously shot on location behind them One more thing the movie is not racist by the standards of the 1930 s until the 1960 s that s the way colored people were thought of and portrayed back then Shaft hadn t even been thought about at that time nor would audiences have accepted any other portrayals of them at the time in history Safaris actually did use natives carrying luggage on their heads and Tiny s character did die a heroic death trying to save the white hunters and Jane As a matter of fact it wasn t until Gene Autry treated the native Americans and colored people in his Westerns like real human beings that Hollywood began to see that it was okay to do so
Hard to believe perhaps but this film was denounced as immoral from more pulpits than any other film produced prior to the imposition of the bluenose Hayes Code Yes indeed priests actually told their flocks that anyone who went to see this film was thereby committing a mortal sin br br I m not making this up They had several reasons as follows br br Item Jane likes sex She and Tarzan are shown waking up one morning in their treetop shelter She stretches sensuously and with a coquettish look she says Tarzan you ve been a bad boy So they ve not only been having sex they ve been having kinky sex A few years later under the Hays Code people especially women weren t supposed to be depicted as enjoying sex br br Item Jane prefers a guileless if wise and resourceful savage Tarzan to a civilized respectable nine to five man Holt When Holt at first wows her with a pretty dress from London she wavers a bit when Holt tries to kill Tarzan and Holt and Jane both believe he s dead she wavers a lot But when she realizes her man is very much alive the attractions of civilization vanish for her And why not Tarzan s and Jane s relationship is egalitarian He lacks the civilized insecurity that would compel him to assert himself as the head of his wife To boot he lacks many more civilized hangups for example jealousy When Holt and his buddy arrive Tarzan greets them both cordially knowing perfectly well that Holt is Jane s old flame When Holt gets her dolled up in a London dress and is slow dancing with her to a portable phonograph Tarzan drops out of a tree and draws his knife Jealous Nope He s merely cautious toward the weird music machine since he s never seen one before Once it s explained he s cool br br Item Civilized Holt is dirty minded Savage Tarzan is innocently sexy As Jane slips into Holt s lamplit tent Holt gets off on watching her silhouette as she changes into the fancy dress By contrast after Tarzan playfully pulls the dress off kicks her into the swimming hole and dives in after her there follows the most tastefully erotic nude scene in all cinema the pair spends five minutes in a lovely water ballet The scene was filmed in three versions clothed topless and nude the scene was cut prior to the film s release but the nude version is restored in the video now available And when Jane emerges and Cheetah the chimp steals her dress just for a tease Jane makes it clear that her irritation is only because of the proximity of civilized men and their hangups Where is the universal prurience so dear to the hearts of seminarians Nowhere that s where Another reason why the hung up regarded this film as sinful br br Item The notion that man is the crown of creation and animals are here only for man s use and comfort takes a severe beating Holt and his buddy want to be guided to the elephant graveyard so they can scoop up the ivory and take it home They want Tarzan to guide them to said graveyard You reader are thinking Fat chance and you re right He s shocked He exclaims Elephants sleep which to him explains everything Jane explains Tarzan s feelings which the two gentlemen find ridiculous br br Item Jane the ex civilized woman is far more resourceful than the two civilized men she accompanies Holt and buddy blow it and find themselves besieged by hostile tribes and wild animals It is Jane who maintains her cool While the boys panic she takes charge barks orders at them and passes out the rifles br br Item Jane s costume is a sort of poncho with nothing underneath The original idea was for her to be topless with foliage artistically blocking off her nipples which indeed is the case in one brief scene br br Lastly several men of the cloth complained because the film was called Tarzan and His Mate rather than Tarzan and His Wife No comment br br Of course Tarzan who has been nursed back to health by his ape friends comes to the rescue routs the white hunters and induces the pack elephants and African bearers to return the ivory they stole to the sacred place whence it came The End br br So there you have it An utterly subversive film Like all the other films about complex and interesting women see e g Possessed with Rita Hayworth and Raymond Massey which constituted such a flowing genre in the early 30 s and which were brought to such an abrupt end by the adoption of the Hays Code br br The joie de vivre of this film is best expressed by Jane s soprano version of the famous Tarzan yell A nice touch which was unfortunately abandoned in future productions br br Let s hear it for artistic freedom feminist Jane and sex
Tarzan and Jane are living happily in the jungle Some men come looking for ivory and to take Jane back to civilization But Jane loves Tarzan and refuses to leave One of the men falls in love with Jane and is determined to take her back even if that means killing Tarzan br br This is a rarity a sequel that s better than the original Tarzan the Ape Man of 1932 was good but had some dreadful special effects and sort of dragged This one has MUCH better effects and is a lot more adult There is tons of blatant racism a black man is shot to death point blank and no one really cares but this was 1934 There s also plenty of blood gore and violence for a 1934 movie and uncut prints have Jane doing a lengthy underwater swim totally nude There s also obvious sexual content and Tarzan and Jane are wearing next to nothing and it s implied they sleep together and have sex without being married This wouldn t bother anyone today but in 1934 this was pretty extreme br br That aside the movie is well directed very fast moving and full of adventure and excitement Seeing Weissmuller in that skimpy lion cloth is certainly a treat for the eyes and Jane s outfit is pretty revealing too I still think Maureen O Sullivan is bad as Jane but Weismuller is perfect as Tarzan Everybody else is OK br br This is easily the best Weismuller O Hara Tarzan out there WELL worth seeing but not for kids
The first of the Tarzan movies staring Johnny Weissmuller The plot has already been summarized so i wont go into it again Just know that The actors who play Jane and Tarzan were born for the role If you have not seen this film and you only have the modern day Tarzan films as a reference you are missing a Real treat Doesn t matter how far we ve come in movie making makeup set designs no one will ever play Tarzan as well as Johnny Weissmuller did He was and is Tarzan
In the opinion of several of my friends and family members including myself this is the finest of the entire gamut of Tarzan movies Johnny Weissmuller never played the part as well in the following issues in the series It definitely rates a 10 in my collection of films
A very interesting entertainment with the charm of the old movies Tarzan faces the greatest perils without hesitation if the moment requires it and we all enjoy with him his success The most insteresting for me is a man without special powers facing the problems and beating them just with human skills he was a great swimmer and had a great shout
This splendidly directed fantasy is the second in the popular by flawed Tarzan series put out by MGM It is a first class adventure for many reasons I suggest fine photography strong imaginative qualities a delightful cast good simulated jungle locales and a very exciting storyline Johnny Weissmuller plays Tarzan a mono syllabic untutored sort unlike Edgar Rice Burroughs creation but he is honest loyal brave and very courageous and he needs to be during this narrative As Jane Parker his wife who had been Jane Porter in the novels Maureen O Sullivan is very attractive and lively as well as being athletic where the script calls for that quality The effect of the lighting the spacious and clever sets is quite unusual This is an outdoor adventure filmed on the MGM back lot which really works The fabulous Mutir Escarpment is a remote locale which allows Tarzan and Jane to live undisturbed but into their idyll come people searching from them emissaries of a civilization Jane has left behind and into which Tarzan could not really be comfortably habituated One is Harry Holt still in love with her who with his friend tempts her to come back to civilization with him the gown and perfumes interest her but she refuses to leave Tarzan Tarzan has to protect her against several wild animals in scenes that look like a humanized King King The group claim to want to hunt animals and Tarzan agrees for Jane s sake to a bit of big game trapping but at some point the idea of ivory and of obtaining a fortune turns the expedition s heads minds Tarzan is shot left for dead and the group force Jane to accompany them on an expedition as they follow a dying elephant to the fabulous elephant s graveyard But they find the area guarded by a savage tribe and are attacked by lions Tarzan rides in on an elephant he has revived in time to call in a most spectacular elephant filled scene he saves Jane and what is left of the expedition who return home little richer but much wise as Jane continues her savage idyll with her new husband The film was directed by set design wizard Cedric Gibbons and quite beautifully too His work and the lighting are the outstanding accomplishments of this entertaining and exciting film which manages to seem real despite all its Hollywood shortcomings from start to finish Neil Hamilton is a very good Harry Paul Cavanagh is even better before and after he reveals himself to be thoroughly bad Forrester Harvey and Nathan Curry round out a small cast very professionally An unusual and well realized fantasy film with interesting situations and some strong dialogue confrontations as well Recommended
This was the second of the series of 6 classic Tarzan movies featuring Johnny Weismuller in the title role and Maureen O Sullivan as Jane br br As usual this was a wonderful film in this series and perhaps stands out as an in between film in a progression that could almost exemplify the development of cinema from the early 1930s into the 1940s As such it displayed good pace though not as good as subsequent films Likewise the cinematography is less accomplished than later Tarzan films in this series The stock I saw was of uneven quality containing some grainy scenery and some under exposed and over exposed scenes The crisp display of later Tarzan films is lacking here On the other hand there is one scene very early on in which the jerky movements of a camera with foliage swishing in front of it as the camera backs up showing safari men forging ahead into the jungle was really almost modern in its style and stands in strong contrast to the stationary shots that make up the rest of the movie br br Regarding plot one interesting feature here was Jane s near fickleness and inconstancy when she was being subject to Martin s flirtations The kiss and Jane s stunned and partly guilty reaction foreshadow something of the Jane we see in the future as well in these films Compare for example in Tarzan Finds a Son Jane s duplicitous actions tricking Tarzan and delivering Boy to his family Later she admits to Tarzan that she was wrong Here nothing quite so explicit but we have Jane returning to the Jane Parker of yesteryear and in an almost repentant series of actions stripping herself of the evening gown brought by Martin and Harry to entice her away from Tarzan br br There were a whole series of depictions and sequences that especially struck me in this viewing br br For one thing the picture we get of the domestic life of Tarzan is here as later a combination of sensual idyll with always the nearby possibility of violent death This to me is very much at the core of the Tarzan experience br br I was really surprised by some quite violent scenes even by today s standards br br There were a whole series of scenes that gave me special pleasure Tarzan leading the elephants into the Valley of the Elephants Graveyard Tarzan being rescued from watery death by the hippo and then nursed to health by the apes Cheetah going to find Tarzan when Jane and the other men are trapped at the foot of the escarpment Cheetah in particular crossing the river on the log The final battle scenes of savages lions on the ground and savages apes in the trees Jane showing us that she is truly of Tarzan s world now quickly displaying her enterprising woodcraft to work up a line of fire to keep the lions away br br The final series of scenes is splendid suddenly Tarzan is on the scene flinging savages from the trees and taking charge of the lions and summoning the elephants to the rescue That final cry of Tarzan in triumph holding a happy Jane in his arms with a dancing and delighted Cheetah beside them is a memorably picture and really a fine summation of the story of Tarzan and Jane br br All in all this is another wonderful classic Tarzan movie I would recommend this movie strongly to anyone
Tarzan and His Mate the second of MGM s Tarzan pictures picks up a year after the events of Tarzan the Ape Man Tarzan and Jane have been living happily in the jungle and Harry Holt one of the expeditioners in the first film returns this time accompanied by the less than honorable Martin Arlington in quest of the ivory from the elephants graveyard Naturally a variety of perilous and exciting adventures take place along the way br br The first film romanticized everything the jungle adventure romance itself wild animals and even death The second film still has a great deal of romanticism and a lot of wonderful action sequences but a more serious tone underlies the action The characters dare to ask questions like What if something happened to Tarzan What would Jane do if she was stranded by herself in the middle of the jungle and she had to fend for herself While these are probably the questions real people would be asking in this situation it creates a certain amount of somberness that isn t always as much fun as the throw caution to the wind attitude of the original br br One of the most enjoyable aspects of this film is the growth we see in Tarzan and Jane s relationship Tarzan still speaks very broken English but he has clearly learned a few new words from his mate Additionally their love for each other has really blossomed and we feel like they really have spent a year together in the jungle br br Most people consider Tarzan and His Mate superior to the original Tarzan the Ape Man Personally I liked the first film just a little bit better The main reason is that the relationship between the Harry Holt Martin Arlington team isn t nearly as likable as Holt s relationship with James Parker Jane s father from the original The Mr Arlington character could have worked as a great movie villain but he plays the hero for far too much of the movie The movie can never decide whether we should like him or hate him Also I don t want to give anything away but in one of the scenes where we should clearly hate him Jane never finds out about those events so the ending isn t quite as satisfying as it could have been All of these detractors are relatively minor however and it s still a great movie br br Like the first film Tarzan and His Mate has amazing action scenes wonderful wildlife footage and one of the screen s all time greatest romances If you liked the first film in the series this is definitely a sequel to see
When I was a kid it was Lex Barker s time as Tarzan I often heard from older people that Johnny Weissmuller was Tarzan and I wouldn t understand why since I saw a couple of Weismuller s last films in the character and I thought he was sort of out of shape It wasn t after many years that I came across Tarzan and His Mate and then I understood Weismuller is in shape in this picture and has the presence and rugged looks the character demands not matched yet by other Tarzans such as Barker Gordon Scott Jock Mahoney Denny Miller Miles O Keefe and Cristopher Lambert br br As for this film I was also surprised by the sensual presence of beautiful Maureen O Sullivan a strong self minded active and no inhibitions woman as Jane way ahead of the times in which the film was made Tarzan pushes her into a pond naked as she is amused one of the explorers kisses her by surprise and though she doesn t kiss him back she sort of let him do for a bit and makes no big deal out of it such behaviors were unthinkable with the Janes to come such as Brenda Joyce Vanessa Brown Virginia Huston or Dorothy Hart all playing sort of too perfect sweet vulnerable women making it hard to believe they could survive in a hostile place like the African jungle br br O Sullivan character s sparkling personality steals the show out of Tarzan himself except of course when it comes to action and Weismuller takes the lead easily the combination is perfect Another highlight in the movie is Cheeta s secondary role and not as the main lead like in later Tarzan pictures where she often saves the day br br Tarzan and His Mate stands as a fine product in its genre Tarzan films and perhaps as the best though I have to admit that I also enjoyed Tarzan s Greatest Adventure 1959 made with a higher budget and a strong supporting cast and in spite of the just acceptable Gordon Scott in the leading role with his too perfect all gymnasium physical looks that doesn t fit for a rustic ape man br br Good for Jane and her mate
Like Tarzan the Ape Man 1932 only more so There s more of everything more animals more varied African tribes and scenes in which the thought must be if this was good with three or four lions forty would be better Tarzan wrestles with crocodiles the the crocodile machine spins in the water like a rolling pin around and around jaws flapping Tarzan can kill it with his ubiquitous knife if the blasted saurian would hold still Tarzan kills lions and rhinos and a steadily increasing number of animals His friends are real chimps people wearing larger ape costumes and elephants In fact they use Indian elephants far more friendly and trainable than African ones with costume ears attached to their heads The human story another white man worse than the rest shows up to join with Holt to go after the ivory from the elephant graveyard Tarzan won t show them the way so the bad guy shoots an elephant so they can follow it to its deathbed Tarzan intercedes and the bad guy shoots him but of course he survives and returns to save Jane Everybody else dies Holt and the bad guy and every single one of their boys People are expendable especially Africans and there doesn t seem to be much distinction between the black fellows who die because they work for the white men travelling through taboo country and those black fellows who kill them This must be the last Tarzan movie before the Hays Code made Jane wear more clothes There are a number of underwater scenes in which Jane swims nude and though the light is flickering the movement and the glimpses are very appealing Apparently one of Weismuller s friends from the Olympic swim team did the nude scenes and not Maureen O Sullivan She however moves through the movie wearing the same sort of loincloth Weismuller wears plus a bikini top showing a splendid glimpse of thigh and hip They still don t need to talk a lot They sleep together and hang out with cool animals and stay away from cities No wonder they re happy
I recommend watching this film with your significant other if you re planning a romantic evening with him her The chemistry between Johnny Weissmuller and Maureen O Sullivan as Tarzan and Jane is so steamy it could fog up your screen br br After the original film we begin to see how Tarzan and Jane have adapted to the jungle and to each other Jane s skimpy jungle wear and Tarzan s protest when Jane covers up for their visitors illuminates that they are not just romantically but also quite sexually in love br br One s imagination can supplement the constant touching and love talk between Tarzan Jane to portray how much Jane is actually teaching Tarzan about love emotionally romantically and sexually And Jane s student is not only embracing but also thriving with his previously untapped sexuality br br The skin show in this film is off the charts In addition to Jane s two piece sexy midriff leg and hip baring costume she also has an underwater nude swim with Tarzan although it is not O Sullivan but Olympic swimmer Josephine McKim who doubles for her in this scene Weissmuller also reveals a tremendous body and perfect pectorals in his barely there loincloth The ladies will delight when Weissmuller emerges from the water after his lengthy fight with the giant crocodile and sounds his yell with his water soaked loincloth practically falling off his hips br br It s a shame that the over protective censors toned down the adult nature of the Tarzan films after this entry Although the Weissmuller Tarzan films would still prosper in the years to come they would rarely approach the sex appeal of this movie
As noted by other reviewers this is one of the best Tarzan movies Unlike others however I like the beginning of the film as it feels like a pretty accurate depiction of what a trading post must have been like Plus the exposition is needed so we know why Harry wants to go back into the jungle In addition the beginning of the film contains one of the most thrilling and terrifying chase sequences ever made This occurs when Harry s safari group has to outrun a tribe of cannibals The pre censorship production values add a lot of realism genuinely depicting the terrible dangers that awaited Europeans going into the jungle The film also offers though perhaps antecedently an accurate account of how horribly treated the native Africans were by their white employers In addition sexy Jane thousands of elephants some great sets and two chetas Not to be missed an adventure classic
Considered by almost all the critics to be the best of the Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan films I have no argument with that although there are a couple of others I thought just as entertaining One thing it s the longest of the series that I ve seen at 105 minutes I ve only seen six of them but this was longer than I m used to and with the drawn out action finale I thought the whole thing was a bit too long br br Nonetheless it is a good mixture of action suspense and romance The only things missing are color and stereo sound The primitive special effects don t bother me as that was all that they had back in the 1930s br br Among some this film is most noted for one thing skin Jane never wore anything this skimpy after this film as the Hays Code was instituted by the time the next Tarzan film was made Her outfit showed what a great figure Maureen O Sullivan possessed The nude underwater scene however was not her by a longshot The woman under the water didn t have a good figure at all whoever it was br br There is plenty of action in here Up to the finale it was not overdone either The ending went on for 15 minutes though and was so intense that it was almost too much to watch br br Still this movie offers about everything except Boy their adopted son you d want to see in a Tarzan film even O Sullivan doing her Tarzan yell about a dozen times With her pair of lungs that was no problem
There s something wonderful about the fact that a movie made in 1934 can be head and shoulders above every Tarzan movie that followed it including the bloated and boring 1980s piece Greystoke Once the viewer gets past the first three scenes which are admittedly dull Tarzan and his Mate takes off like a shot offering non stop action humor and romance Maureen O Sullivan is charming and beautiful as Jane and walks off with the movie Weismuller is solid as well Highly recommended
The release of TARZAN THE APE MAN in 1932 caused a sensation It may be hard to believe 70 years later but the film had much of the same kind of impact as THE MATRIX or THE LORD OF THE RINGS has achieved at a time when movies and radio were the major sources of entertainment Tarzan became an instant pop icon the noble savage that every woman fantasized about and every man wished he could be The only person unhappy about the situation was Edgar Rice Burroughs who while he d agreed to MGM s creative liberties and enjoyed his hefty royalty checks felt the dumbed down version of his character with no plans to allow him to grow was unfaithful to his vision he would start a production company and soon be making his own Tarzan films MGM realizing the value of it s newest star knew the sequel would have to be even more spectacular than the original and TARZAN AND HIS MATE delivered br br The film had an interesting back story Cedric Gibbons MGM s legendary Art Director had gotten a commitment from the studio to direct the sequel prior to the release of TARZAN THE APE MAN despite the fact that he d NEVER directed before the studio hadn t anticipated the film s impact and didn t think a novice director would matter much on a novelty film and they wanted to keep their Oscar winning department chief happy Gibbons a prodigiously talented and imaginative visual artist loved the freedom of pre Code Hollywood and decided to have TARZAN AND HIS MATE push the envelope to the limit Tarzan and Jane would frolic in a nude swim and Jane would appear TOPLESS through most of the film Maureen O Sullivan said in an interview shortly before her death in 1998 that while a double was used for the swim she trusted the studio and did a couple of days of filming sans top but it became too much of a headache trying to strategically place plants and fruit to block her nipples and the idea was abandoned the film shot those days would be worth a fortune She did do a nude silhouette scene in a tent flashed her breasts at the conclusion of her swim and donned a revised jungle costume that was extremely provocative very thin and open at the sides and the resulting outcry would help create the Hays Office and the self censorship that would soon engulf the entire industry br br MGM yanked Gibbons from the production the official reason given was his workload as Art Director and veteran Jack Conway was listed as the new director to appease the critics although James C McKay actually directed the film as Conway was busy on 3 other projects including VIVA VILLA br br The film incorporated the best elements of the original safaris murderous tribes Tarzan fighting jungle beasts to the death to save Jane and actually improved on the storytelling Harry Holt Neil Hamilton from the first film returns to Africa for ivory from the Elephants Graveyard and to try to seduce Jane into returning to England with gifts of silk dresses underwear and perfume He brings with him Martin Arlington Paul Cavanagh a crack shot and inveterate womanizer who sneers at Holt s chivalrous pursuit of Jane and stalks her as a potential conquest to be had by any means including killing Tarzan if and when he can get away with it without being seen br br Tarzan barely tolerates the intrusion into his happy life with Jane and puts his foot down refusing to allow the hunters into the Graveyard Arlington finds his opportunity catching the Ape Man alone and shoots him then returns to the camp with a fabricated story of his demise Now Jane has no reason to remain in the jungle and she can direct them to the Graveyard before her long voyage back to England comforted by the oh so sympathetic Arlington But a savage tribe and hideous torture await the group can Tarzan being nursed back to health by his ape family recover in time to save Jane br br While stock footage is again used extensively the racial stereotypes of the 30s are apparent and the gorillas are obviously actors in ape suits TARZAN AND HIS MATE achieves a level of sophistication unsurpassed in any other Tarzan film as well as a sexiness that even Bo Derek s blatantly erotic TARZAN THE APE MAN couldn t touch Johnny Weissmuller was in peak condition physically Maureen O Sullivan was never more beautiful and Africa never looked more romantic and dangerous br br TARZAN AND HIS MATE was a triumph although it would be drastically edited for many years and remains THE classic of the series to this day

I saw this movie once as a kid on the late late show and fell in love with it br br It took 30 years but I recently did find it on DVD it wasn t cheap either in a catalog that specialized in war movies We watched it last night for the first time The audio was good however it was grainy and had the trailers between reels Even so it was better than I remembered it I was also impressed at how true it was to the play br br The catalog is around here someplace If you re sincere in finding it fire me a missive and I ll see if I can get you the info cartwrightbride yahoo com
William Wyler was to have directed this adaptation of Moss Hart s hit Broadway play with music recruiting poster vivant but his own military commitments intervened and it went to a most unlikely helmsman George Cukor The women s director has a sure touch on the many documentary like sequences of Air Corps training and he invests it with more unhackneyed humanity than the genre generally allowed particularly in wartime Sure the gee whiz and entirely white save for one unbilled Chinese American recruit bunch of newbies are nicer and more wholesome than in real life and the speechifying about home and Mom and the wife and kid gets pretty thick but it s efficient propaganda and undeniably stirring Notable too for the all military male cast several of whom didn t reemerge for years Lon McAllister Edmond O Brien Martin Ritt Red Buttons in drag as an Andrews Sister Peter Lind Hayes Karl Malden Kevin McCarthy Gary Merrill Lee J Cobb and Don Taylor Also for a very early glimpse of Judy Holliday who doesn t show up till an hour and a half into the picture but has some good little sequences as O Brien s worried sick Brooklyn spouse Too bad its rights are in a tangle and the only print anyone knows of is 16mm evidently after Twentieth Century Fox released it to considerable success the rights reverted to the Army and if there s a good 35mm print out there it probably lies somewhere in the bowels of the Pentagon It s disingenuous and corny in spots but it also captures the rigors of military training and the terrors of war vividly and it deserves to be more widely seen
This movie gets it right As a former USAF Aviation Cadet I can tell you this movie has it all The tedium of the application process The waiting for word The joy of acceptance The worry about making it through the course The sorrow of watching one s buddies perhaps the best of them wash out The anguish of paying the ultimate price the death of fllow student airmen The glory of graduation Always the flying the flying the flying Many are called but few are chosen We did for pay what we would have eagerly paid to do
This movie has always been a favorite of mine since first seeing it as a 12 year old kid in 1962 when it was shown on a Los Angeles television station s late show The characters are very engaging from the start of the picture and it is too bad that the movie has never been released for video tape nor is it ever shown on television apparently due to a prohibition by the Estate of Moss Hart the playwright producer director who wrote the story and first presented it on the New York stage during WWII the reason for denying its showing is hard to fathom more than 50 years after it was made I did not see the movie again for over 30 years when someone who had actually been a major cast member of the movie was able to get me a bootlegged copy on VHS poor video quality but good audio My memory of it was correct it was still an engaging and fascinating movie to watch An amazing aspect of this film is just how many of its stars just starting out in their careers at the time 1944 went on to became either major motion picture stars or at least well known and fully employed actors e g Judy Holliday Edmond O Brien Jeanne Crain Barry Nelson Don Taylor Karl Malden Peter Lind Hayes George Superman Reeves Red Buttons Lee J Cobb Kevin McCarthy and Gary Merrill The scenes with the B 24 Liberators are terrific especially the close up shots where the details of the giant for those times 4 engine bomber then 18 000 manufactured now nearly extinct can be seen Good insight into the different levels of training that a pilot cadet went through on his way to being assigned to a bomber crew of course VERY gender biased as was the trend of the day only the MEN became pilots the women just supported them in their roles hardly acceptable in today s world I hope someday it will be released onto video for a new generation to enjoy
I had a personal interest in this movie When I was 17 and just out of high school I got a job at 20th Century Fox as a member of the Laborers and Hod Carriers Union At the end of my first day sweeping the deck of an aircraft carrier I was told to bring a suitcase the next morning with enough clothes etc for one or two weeks When I arrived the next morning a bus was waiting and about 20 of us headed south toward San Diego Just short of there we stopped at an army base called either Camp Callan or Camp Hahn Once we were bunked in we went north a few miles into Camp Pendleton the big Marine base There on the beach we started building what was supposed to be a Japanese Pacific island base It took us about a week or ten days to complete the installation which included a water tank gun entrenchments sand bagged trenches and living quarters All this was at very high pay sometimes golden time which was triple our regular hourly wage Our food was also first rate prime rib at lunch etc which was amazing because it was wartime and very hard to get good meat at home br br Once the job was finished I waited eagerly for the movie to come out which was about eight or ten months later Then I waited eagerly through two hours of the movie before my handiwork finally came on screen Then it was no more than three or four minutes maybe less of the movie s heroes dive bombing the base and blowing it to smithereens A bit disappointing but still fun br br In spite of the disappointment I enjoyed the movie and have not seen it since I learned later that this movie was underwritten by the government and Fox was paid on a cost plus basis which maybe accounts for our extravagant pay and lifestyle down there Bob Weverka
This movie is a ripoff of James Cain s novel THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE Apparently the director and producer never bothered to pay for rights to this story perhaps the fact that we were in the middle of fighting the Italians in WWII might account for their forgetting to consider royalties Despite this the movie isn t really just an Italian version of the Hollywood movie In some ways it s a lot better and in other ways it is definitely not br br The three central characters in this movie are really pretty ugly people In fact the male and female lovers are a bit icky looking The male lead is pretty ordinary except for his profuse body hair particularly on the back and shoulders and his lady love is to put it frankly unattractive They are a very very far cry from Lana Turner and John Garfield in the Hollywood version And the ill fated husband is really really obese and loves to walk around shirtless and his counterpart in the American film Cecil Kellaway is definitely better looking and probably better looking than the other two Italian leads actually And this unattractiveness is generally a reason I actually preferred the Italian film since I just could NOT imagine a finely coiffed dish like Lana Turner in the middle of nowhere married to Kellaway I am 100 sure she would have had dozens of better offers Whereas the Italian wife frankly might NOT have been able to do much better and this made the marriage actually believable br br Part of the Italian film s believability comes from the blunt way it handles sex The sanitized American film tries to make you believe that although Turner and Garfield kill Kellaway they never actually get around to sex This is pretty silly and totally unrealistic In addition to the casual sexuality of the film it s also pretty casual in showing the seamy side of life with lots of sweaty people a fly strip hanging over the kitchen table and everyone appeared to need a bath br br The movie is also pretty fast paced compared to the over long American film And what you get due to brevity isn t all good The film lacks a lot of the style and polish of the American film with grainier footage relatively poor orchestration and sets It sure ain t a pretty film but the Neo Realistic like style makes the film seem more realistic But it cannot make up for the short cuts in the plot Many of the plot elements in the later American version are either missing entirely or glossed over And the ending seems a lot less interesting than the American film and misses the entire human nature dilemma when Turner and Garfield turn on each other like rats the best part of the American film br br So which is the better film Well a lot of this probably depends on you As for me the Warner Brothers film was simply too polished and too unrealistic though many like this style and may dislike watching films with subtitles but it packed a great ending And the Italian film was much much more realistic until the crappy ending that seemed too rushed So neither film is exactly great but I d give my nod to the Italian one being a bit better It s too bad they couldn t have combined the best elements of both films into one exceptional film
The Ruth Snyder Judd Gray murder in 1927 inspired Ogden Nash to write a Broadway play called Machinal More famously it inspired James M Cain to write two short novels which anyone who has actually reached the point where they are reading this review would be familiar with Double Indemnity and The Postman Always Rings Twice Both became film noir classics of the 1940 s Double Indemnity being arguably the most perfect noir ever made Some of the real life elements of the Snyder Gray story were captured by Cain the old age and indifference of Albert Gray Ruth s high sex drive Ruth and Judd s passionate affair and complicity in the murder and that famous double indemnity insurance clause Missing elements included the fact that the actual setting was a very urban Manhattan Albert Snyder being a respected newspaper editor The numerous incompetent and failed attempts were also ignored in order to cut to the chase br br Cain s Double Indemnity was filmed perfectly by Billy Wilder let s ignore Stanwyck s ridiculous wig as one of those interesting accidents of film lore The Postman Always Rings Twice however was filmed thrice and Ossessione an Italian version and Luchino Visconti s first film was the first of three versions Before commenting on it I ll recommend the Lana Turner John Garfield version of 1946 in its entirety and five minutes of the 1981 Jack Nicholson Jessica Lange version for the great sex scene on the dining table br br Ossessione is not as noirish as The Postman Always Rings Twice It has a strong neo realist look which makes it a great movie but a lot of the essential noir elements are missing It does not have low key lighting and unconventional camera angles The dialog is not hard boiled and instead the film concentrates more on characterization This is the longest version of the story and goes deeply into characterization Its also a lot more sexual than the Lana Turner version We have a very obvious adulterous relationship and Giovanna is very obviously a nymphomaniac A new character is introduced into the story La Spagnola with very obvious homosexual overtones There is also a small but very well played role for a dancer who moonlights as a prostitute br br This is a far greater study of the working class than of crime The audience really gets the feeling of poverty and grime The drifter is a complete tramp the wife is no Lana Turner and may even have been a prostitute before marriage Her husband is an obscene capitalist obese rude and arrogant I think the casting was brilliant for this film My only beef is with the overlong running time Everything is drawn out too long and it would have been more effective if it had been more economical Nevertheless fans of noir and realism will definitely like Ossessione as I did
Well I d heard from somewhere that Ossessione is a precursor to the Italian film genre and particular favourite of mine the Giallo but actually aside from the fact that this is a thriller that was made in Italy the two have pretty much no relation In the sixties and seventies Italian film makers would get themselves a reputation for ripping off just about every successful American film released They ve not done that here but Ossessione does follow almost the exact same story as the later American film The Postman Always Rings Twice without giving the book s author James M Cain so much as a credit Anyway the plot focuses on Gino Costa a handsome drifter who by chance stumbles upon a caf√© where a woman named Giovanna Bragana works He soon learns that she s married to Giuseppe a big fat annoying man whom Giovanna can t stand to have even touching her He wants the pair of them to run away together but she s not so keen on the idea However fate ends up intervening and her plan to have her husband murdered is successful br br Despite the fact that the film loses some credibility for not crediting the author whose story it s based on it has to be said that director Luchino Visconti implements the film noir style well and in a way I even prefer the atmosphere of this film to some of the bigger American noir classics The story is as you would expect extremely strong and the Visconti manages to pull good performances out of his cast Visconti drags the film out a little bit too much however and with a running time of almost 135 minutes I felt that the story was too thin to warrant this kind of length I almost feel guilty for levelling all this criticism at Ossessione as it IS a good film but it s not a great film The relationship between the two central characters is never really explored properly and it seems like the film is keener to distract us from it rather than let us into the characters heads There s not much mystery to the plot as we pretty much always know what s going on and by not always focusing on the characters themselves the film is not as interesting as it could have been Still it makes for an interesting viewing and comes recommended for that reason although it s not as good as the 1946 version of the same James M Cain classic
Ossessione br br Luchino Visconti s debut film this Italian noir is generally credited with launching the Neorealist movement well it says so right on the back of the box and is a sometimes penetrating sometimes lugubrious portrait of lonesome individuals in moral flux Set in Fascist Italy an assortment of supporting characters including an ingenuous drifter who espouses Communist virtues embody the remote desperations of a country searching for its identity from without drifting phantasms longing for a soul Although Visconti s compassion for the disenfranchised and his ability to express their lamentable conditions was already well developed the spider web of deceit is tenuous although a staple of noir is to posit a protagonist manipulated by fate and the femme fatale Gino here is so unhinged to begin with that you fear he might deserve it the cosmic irony too didactic the illicit relationship strained with bathos All the same it s incisive and essential although its actual impact on film history is certainly debatable
Audiences today will probably watch a film like Ossessione and not really consider how unprecedented it was during the time when it came out The structure of the film really divorces from sap happy Hollywood conventions as well as other major theatrical elements It relies more upon depicting reality in a very grim and sober light Films of this nature the neo realist films were made to reflect the darkness felt during post World War II times Ossessione tackles some fairly provocative issues that were probably unseen on screen prior to the war including adultery conspiracy murder pregnancy etc Aside from the one crane shot and certain musical swelling moments the film aesthetic is very raw and gritty shot on location uses natural lighting and most likely non popular actors All of these elements helped convey the issues explored in the film yielding the following theme Negative karmic repercussions will haunt those who deliberately act immorally br br The two leads Gino and Giovanna are polar opposites yet both carry the mentality we re bored and we want to be entertained Gino is a drifter a lone traveler who embraces life and its constant fluctuations Giovanna is a bored house wife cemented in the familiarly of marital permanence she doesn t want to leave her home and husband but would rather remain where she is because it s safer Gino s lifestyle represents the ideal lifestyle Giovanna craves the only difference is that she s too afraid to live it herself that s why she falls in love with Gino he represents everything she wants but doesn t have the courage to get She wants to live in a world free from the monotony of living with her corpulent husband Gino is the perfect ticket into that world The affair that ensues between the two most likely left audiences back in the 40 s feeling somewhat uneasy I mean films prior to the neo realist age never showed such scandalous behavior on screen before To say the least it was probably a bit alarming br br In conjunction with the theme the neo realist style helps show the negative repercussions of adulterous behavior Succinctly put adulterous behavior as shown in the film leads to depressing and ultimately deadened lives When Gino and Giovanna conspire with each other to eliminate Giovanna s husband karma comes to haunt them like a plague after the deed is done They return to their home the atmosphere is dark and biting as can be expected from the neo realist style They are not happy they re actually more depressed They thought that by eliminating Giovanna s husband that they d live happier lives but they were duped The film ends with Giovanna s death it being in karmic similitude of her husband s death I think this is a very satisfying ending for several reasons Here s why br br There s a lot of talk as to whether or not evil should be depicted on screen and if so to what extent I think depicting evil is very necessary if and only if the evil depicted is not being glorified but rather shows what negative consequences evil actions have As the subtext of Ossessione asks is adultery and murder evil I think the film eagerly responds yes The adulterous behavior between the two reveals how unhappy they are Ironically though towards the end of the film when they seem to be healed of their depression and are seen basking in each other s arms inside the car the author of the film shows that their happiness is in fact a fa√ßade the car crashes off the cliff and into the river killing Giovanna the police arrest Gino I think it was the author s intention to say that even though people sometimes try and justify their immoral behavior in the end karma will come back to haunt them I agree I think the two got what was coming to them because they both were incredibly selfish always wanting instant gratification and not willing to endure through hard times This was especially made clear after the first sign of difficulty that Gino and Giovanna experience in their relationship he can t handle the pressure of living in Giovanna s husband shadow so he leaves Giovanna and sleeps with another girl Such is typical of the insatiable hedonistic personality br br All in all the film seemed very risky for its time The audience however was prepared to see such a film because of the sobriety the war brought Those pre war happy go lucky films were no longer being believed Movie going audiences were ready to see and contemplate difficult films with complex characters they wanted to see characters whose lives were entangled in so called sin because it was a reflection of their own life problems Ossessione then acts as a great catalyst for where the future of film was heading That is a lot of the naturalism pieces we see today can be said to have been influenced by the neo realist film movement
Oh those sneaky Italians It s not the first time they based a movie on source material without the permission or knowledge of the in this case author of the novel Of course this is not something that is typically Italian but got done quite a lot in the early days of cinema mostly because they often thought they would be able to get away with it James M Cain s publishers managed to keep this movie off American screens until 1976 but nevertheless the movie itself has grown a bit into a well known classic br br The movie is not as great to watch as the 1946 American version but it s a great movie nevertheless This of course not in the least is due to the movie it s great strong story that is an intriguing one and provides the movie with some great characters and realism It follows the novel quite closely and is therefore mostly the same as other movie versions of its story with of course as a difference that it got set in an Italian environment br br Leave it up to the Italians to make a movie about life and the real people in it These early drama s always have a very realistic feeling over it and are therefore also quite involving to watch Unfortunately the movie lost some of its power toward the end when the movie started to feel a bit overlong and dragging in parts The movie could had easily ended 15 minutes earlier br br Nevertheless I don t really have much else negative to say about this movie It s simply a greatly made one based on some equally great and strong source material Quite an impressive directorial debut for Luchino Visconti who continued to direct some many more great and memorable Italian dramatic movies br br 8 10
Visconti s first film has all his trademark visual flair and immaculate technique accompanied by compelling performances from Massimo Girotti as the handsome drifter and best of all Clara Calamai as the fabulous frantic Giovanna Remade several times as The Postman Rings Twice but never bettered Can t believe this was the man s first film It shows the confidence of someone at the zenith of their career
I m not sure under what circumstances director Visconti decided to film James Cain s novel The Postman Always Rings Twice I m not even sure if Viscounti acquired the book s rights but the resulting movie is definitely interesting It is not the best version of Cain s story I like the 1981 version best but thanks to Visconti s excellent direction and the casting of Clara Calamai and Massimo Girotti a very sensual couple it is a must for noir fans Visconti mixes neorealism with noir sensibilities to great effect The film is not perfect though My main complaint is that the film is a little too long for its own good the story moves at a very slow pace I don t think Visconti was very good at editing his films I think film noir works better with a short running time Fortunately Calamai and Girotti are magnetic actors that keep the viewer interested Anyhow as much as I like this film and the remakes I think no one has made the definitive version of Cain s much praised book
When people nowadays hear of a 1940s drama they usually appear to create a distance of irony claiming that it s another tearjerker with great stars in the lead of tragic melancholic roles This opinion however does not resemble Neorealist movies in particular this one directed by Count Luchino Visconti OSSESSIONE as his debut once censored and once cherished as nearly a realistic masterpiece is still loved by some people and strongly criticized by others The contradictory opinions about the film that have appeared in these 65 years seem to have been caused by the content of the movie itself exceptionally controversial for modern times as well as the past At the same time while being based on the novel by James M Cain THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE it is one of the most genuine screen adaptations where director remains his own style view his own art I have seen the film twice and the second viewing led me to very detailed analysis part of which I d like to entail below br br First Visconti s movie seems to touch all psychology and actions that people may do in life in particular those absorbed by desire These people make such tragic decisions in spite of terrible consequences they are bound to face Gino Massimo Girotti a traveler with bear like shoulders turns up at the crossroad of a motorway near Ferrara and enters the tavern Although many people go there to have a meal Gino occurs to get something more much more the indefatigable desire of beautiful Giovanna Clara Calamai a woman already married to an elderly man who runs the bar Mr Giuseppe Bragana Juan De Landa Her body and her song possess his mind totally and from the moment of their first love the couple plan to get rid of the old obstacle and build up a new life together However are people bound to wrong deeds in face of desire Can one build love upon murder What is love and what is loyalty Does desire lead to a dangerous addiction or even obsession Such questions intensely arise while watching the movie when to the core the viewer is supplied with an insight into characters We have to love each other affectionately answers Giovanna seemingly giving a cure to all crying conscience but may desirous love justify and cure everything Isn t it what we both wanted says one of the couple it occurs that it s not Therefore the content of the film appears to be very dangerous if not analyzed with intellect and heart Yet it constantly remains thought provoking br br Second OSSESSIONE has a very strong point that talks to modern viewers brilliant moments and marvelous cinematography which go in pair with memorable sequences and visual power These make a modern viewer realize that a film made almost 70 years ago is absolutely entertaining to watch They range from tasteful erotic images to purely technical shots Who can possibly skip that moment in Ferrara where Gino meets a beautiful girl a sort of Ragazza Perfetta perfect girl a dancer Anita and buys her ice cream His desires show him totally different direction Do viewers remain indifferent at Gino Giovanna s first meeting The first focus of camera is on Giovanna s legs seemingly representing carnal desire over love that Gino experiences A marvel of shot is Gino and Giovanna leaving the investigation room and the closeup of their shadows that directs our attention towards their suspicious look br br Third OSSESSIONE can boast outstanding performances both from the leading pair as well as the supporting cast Massimo Girotti once said in an interview that working in this movie had been one of the most difficult jobs he had ever done yet consequently what comes out is a flawless acting He portrays a bisexual man torn within desires who commits a crime but cannot stand any of the objects that remind him of his victim which represents conscience His bisexuality is indicated through the character of Lo Spagnolo Elio Marcuzzo whom he meets in very surprising circumstances in the train for Ancona Clara Calamai who was cast in the role after eminent Anna Magnani had refused fits very well to the role and we may claim that there is a true chemistry between the couple They are both very convincing Besides I liked Juan De Langa in the role of Bragana he portrays an old husband not affectionate to his wife and still crazy about high art In some of his most witty moments he asks his wife to wash his back or walks in the empty streets singing his favorite opera songs after sort of karaoke performance br br In sum we as modern viewers who are capable of critical view have to look at this film very objectively It is art for sure thanks to the aspects aforementioned it is a powerful story as well thanks to the controversy it carries yet is it educational Visconti was not Fellini who said that he did not carry any message for humanity In such case his films would only entertain which is of course not entirely Fellini s style too Visconti always had something to convey What did he want to say here Is the film against bad marriage Or is it against wrong actions of people absorbed by desire The final shocking moments say for themselves Though you don t have to agree with the vision OSSESSIONE is really a wonderfully realistic film one of Visconti s best 8 10
A deplorable social condition triggers off the catastrophe An impoverished Giovanna has ended up in the gutter but still has an ace up her sleeve beauty and youth Bragana a fat bellied gas station tenant who has been getting on in years picks her up from the street and offers her bed and home together with his clumsy affection But the physical contact that Giovanna is now exposed to only gives her feelings of disgust and consequently she does not see a benefactor in him but a tormentor whom she has to get rid of br br The arrival of Gino a young migrant worker finally provides her the longed for opportunity And you don t have to ask her twice At the very first encounter she gives him the feeling of being physically desired and a little later she lets him seduce her without offering any resistance br br The developping partnership has to submit to the strict rules drawn up by Giovanna though Gino s yearning for freedom is suppressed his desire to leave the place with Giovanna and start a new life far away from the fatso is pushed aside Giovanna aims at another goal to get Bragana killed to inherit and in addition to that to collect the insurance premium In her hands Gino degenerates into a self sacrificing tool Being completely at the mercy of this woman he turns into a cold blooded killer br br But in contrast to Giovanna he questions the committed crime on a moral level The very taking over of Bragana s place which includes the sleeping in the bed of a dead man causes a deep loathing of himself And later after he has found out about the forthcoming payment of the insurance money and seems to see through Giovanna s cunningly devised plan he also executes a physical separation from his lover and finds comfort in the arms of a prostitute br br If Visconti s film ended at this point it could easily be classified as a condemnatory portrait of a cool calculating and unscrupulous woman with a slight touch of social criticism But then the last sequences make this carefully built construct of ideas collapse At last Giovanna feels remorseful about what she has done and by the uncompromising revelation of her innermost feelings she succeeds in inflaming anew Gino s love Her violent death by an absurd road accident then does not only leave him helpless at the mercy of an arbitrary fate It also affects us while we realize that none of the acting characters is to be made responsible for their disaster The culprit is just the state of a society that determines the way of the individual unalterably right from the start br br
To get in touch with the beauty of this film pay close attention to the sound track not only the music but the way all sounds help to weave the imagery How beautifully the opening scene leading to the expulsion of Gino establishes the theme of moral ambiguity Note the way music introduces the characters as we are led inside Giovanna s marriage Don t expect to find much here of the political life of Italy in 1943 That s not what this is about On the other hand if you are susceptible to the music of images and sounds you will be led into a word that reaches beyond neo realism By the end of the film we there are moments Antonioni like landscape that has more to do with the inner life of the characters than with real places This is one of my favorite Visconti films
TCM is keeping me awake all the time they keep coming up with films Ive never heard of Senso now Ossessione a very early film by Visconti wow the Italian version of The Postman Always Rings Twice brilliant beautifully acted and directed Never heard of either leads who were excellent Clara Calamai as Giovanna and especially Massimo Girotti as Gino what a sensual man more muscular and attractive than anyone else on the screen in 1943 His look was ahead of its time many male stars from the 1950s were probably inspired by him he should have been a major world wide star The film is much better than the Jack Nicholson Jessica Lange version and less glossier than the MGM version which I really like with John Garfield and Lana Turner remember that white outfit who can forget This Italian version is different more realistic and with a very different ending see it watch it Im going to buy it
A masterful treatment of James Caine s The Postman Always Rings Twice as Luchino Visconti s first film shot primarily around Ferrara in a soulless war torn Italy The original negative was thought destroyed but Visconti saved a print and fortunately we can see this early neo realist work today A ruggedly handsome Massimo Girotti and Clara Calamai who had recently revealed her breasts in La Cena delle beffe 1941 star as the sensually charged and ill fated lovers who plot to kill her husband Unusual ending in which although crime does not pay one pays in a way not directly linked to the crime Excellent direction script acting and cinematography Reportedly not as good as the French Le Dernier tournant 1939 but probably better than the US version 1946 featuring Lana Turner and John Garfield in the lead roles Highly recommended
Ossessione adapted loosely or if it is as loose or close to the version I saw of James M Cain s The Postman Always Rings Twice with Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange I can t be certain by first time director Luchino Visconti is no less outstanding with usage of mis en scene music both diegetic and non diegetic and the acting I didn t know what to expect Visconti to do in his approach to the material after seeing La Terra Trema and seeing how sometimes his political motivations snuck in a little bit But this is a totally character and emotional based drama bordering on melodrama however without the conventions that bog down lesser ones and with the style in the finest path of the budding film noir movement Visconti creates a debut that s as involving as any other neo realist film Neo realism by the way could rightfully be claimed as this being a forefather along with De Sica s The Children Are Watching Us which that would take shape after the war Although love and romance is more in play here than in some of the more famous neo realist efforts it s dealt with in a bare bones storytelling fashion and it s laced with other familiar themes in neo realism the lower class death desperation br br Aside from the story which is simply as it is described on this site the artistry with which Visconti captures the images and then layers them with objects a shawl over Gino Costa s profile when in guilt shadows and darkness that tend to overcome many of the later scenes in the film usually over Gian and Giovanna and the feel of the Italian streets in many of the exterior scenes Domenico Scala and Aldo Tonti who would lens some of Rossellini and Fellini s films help in envisioning the look of Ossessione which is usually moving in on a character then pausing to read as much emotion on their faces their voices and mannerisms lovely and ugly sad and dark and romantic I think I ve just scratched the surface on how effective it was that the film itself was moving me along even as I was in fear of the futures of the two leads The two leads Massimo Girotti and Clara Calamai portray all the compelling truthful and near operatic emotions and the key supporting actors are also without their attributes br br It s a brilliant crushing adaptation and it points as a striking signpost of what was to come for Visconti in his career
fascinating look at fascist italy and the people who carved out a life under mussolini street scenes and lifestyle glimpses alone are worth watching combine this with a masterful plot and premier acting and you get a film that you will want to watch again and maybe again
Ossessione is in very bad state but is now undergoing a full restoration at Digital Film Lab in Copenhagen The material used is a Master positive 2nd generation originally from the print Visconti managed to hide from the fascists It has been scanned on the Spirit 4K as 2K RGB data then processed using DaVinci Revival restoration software After this the rest is manual labor and we do not anticipate finishing before early spring Sometime next year it should be available on DVD and hopefully also released on HD DVD This film is beautiful and we hope the restoration effort will be enjoyed by many generations to come
Gino Costa Massimo Girotti is a young and handsome drifter who arrives in a road bar He meets the young beautiful and unsatisfied wife Giovanna Bragana Clara Calamai and her old and fat husband Giuseppe Bragana Juan de Landa owners of the bar He trades his mechanical skills by some food and lodging and has an affair with Giovanna They both decide to kill Giuseppe forging a car accident The relationship of them become affect by the feeling of guilty and the investigation of the police This masterpiece ends in a tragic way The noir and neo realistic movie of Luchino Visconti is outstanding This is the first time that I watch this version of The Postman Always Rings Twice I loved the 1946 version with Lana Turner and the 1981 version where Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange have one of the hottest sex scene in the history of the cinema but this one is certainly the best My vote is ten
Wow The sort of movie you could watch ten times and still delight in its nuances Absolutely incredible If this was Visconti s debut film i shudder to think what would happen if he got any better from film to film The only other one of his i ve seen at time of writing is Death in Venice which was absolutely incredible more dazzling visually than Ossessione Obsession One of the most beautiful films i ve ever seen but its story was not as involving as Ossessione If you click on miscellaneous on this page s links there are stills from the movie on those websites They won t really do justice to the experience of the movie such graceful camera movements such beautiful composition such wonderful faces such terrific characters such a great story development the first movie adapted from James M Cain s The Postman Always Rings Twice br br I can t believe this was made in 43 eight years before Brando was supposed to have introduced realistic acting to the world with Streetcar Named Desire 1951 The actors in this may not have used the method technique ie they may not have truly felt everything themselves i don t know anything about it but they re some of the best most genuine and realistic performances up to this date in cinema Also eight years before Streetcar Named Desire brought a new sensuality to the screen Ossessione was electrifyingly sensual The most sensual thing since the beginning of cinema Yes i m being superlative but Ossessione was just that terrific br br The reason Ossessione didn t cause the impact Streetcar did was that it was made in fascist Italy and banned by Mussolini and re cut in America American audiences didn t see its full glory till 59 eight years AFTER Streetcar br br I won t say any more about it just writing to tell you its one of the best most beautiful and exciting movies i ve ever seen and tell you to go out and see it Like another reviewer i m going to buy it as soon as i can find it
Luchino Visconti was light years ahead of his contemporaries The great directors of Italy of the 40s and 50s were men who understood the medium but it was Luchino Visconti a man of vision who dared to bring a film like to show what he was capable of doing He clearly shows his genius early on in his distinguished career with Ossessione a film based on James Cain s The Postman Always Ring Twice which was later made by Hollywood but that version pales in comparison with what Visconti achieved in the movie Luchino Visconti and his collaborators on the screen included an uncredited Alberto Moravia a man who knew about the effect of passion on human beings br br The film has been well preserved in the DVD format we watched recently The film is a must for all serious movie fans because we can see how Visconti s vision translated the text into a movie that rings true in a plausible way something the American version lacked br br What comes across watching the movie is the intensity which the director got from his key players The magnificent Clara Calamai does an amazing job as Giovanna the woman who has married an older man but when Gino appears in her life all she wants to do is rid herself of the kind man who gave her an opportunity in life Giovanna is one of the best creations in Ms Calamai s achievements in the Italian cinema The last sequence of the film shows Ms Calamai at her best in the ironic twist that serves as the moral redemption for the monstrous crime that was committed br br Equally excellent is Massimo Girotti one of the best actors of his generation who appears as Gino the hunky man that awakens the obsessive passion in Giovanna Gino is the perfect man for Giovanna something that Mr Girotti projects with such ease and sophistication not equaled before in the screen Mr Girotti makes the man come alive in a performance that seems so easy yet with another actor it might not have been so apparent Juan DeLanda is seen as Giuseppe the older man who fell in love with Giovanna In fact his character rings truer than his counterpart in the American film where he is seen more as a buffoon br br The film is beautifully photographed by Domenic Scala and Aldo Tonti They gave the film a naturalistic look that was the way Italian directors of the era favored The original musical score of Giuseppe Rosati is perfect Visconti a man who loved opera and was one of the best directors also includes arias by Bizet and Verdi that fit well in the context of the movie br br Ossessione is a film to treasure because we see a great Luchino Visconti at the top of his form
Some spoilers I have not read the James M Cain novel The Postman Always Rings Twice on which this movie was based so I cannot compare this film version to it but I have seen and love the 1946 US version also entitled Postman br br Even better is this gem from Italy which I have read was mutilated in editing because of too many blatant references to the Fascist regime Well no matter what is left is a fine piece of cinema apparently the forerunner of the neo realist movement in film making One can certainly see why despite whatever harsh editing did go on a pervading sense of societal and cultural as well as personal oppression remains hanging heavy over the protagonists who therefore face many limits in life br br Consider Gino the young drifter not well educated unemployed and resorting to stowing away stealing and conning people in order to get by his one pair of shoes so threadbare as to be virtually useless br br In Giovanna he sees a way out yet he should have kept going as Giovanna is oppressed by her loveless marriage to an older man with some money her job working at the trattoria for her husband slaving away behind the bar and in the kitchen and her sex In the past she had limited options and decided to marry the restaurant gas station owner Giuseppe Bregana played by Juan de Landa anyway knowing that he would not make her happy She tells Gino that she feels sick every time Bregana touches her br br On the pretext of helping Bregana fix his car and sending him into the village to buy a needed part which he has in fact pocketed Gino wins Bregana s favor promising also to fix the broken water pump water symbolizing life or lack thereof and is left alone with Giovanna They immediately start a heated passionate yet volatile love affair br br Gino soon feels stifled by the relationship and feels the need to move on again when Giovanna proposes that they dispose of her husband Wanting no part of it Gino leaves town on a train ride that he cannot afford kindly paid for him by another gypsy type man named Spagnolo a fellow train passenger To Gino Spagnolo represents a sort of freedom and they become friends Spagnolo also symbolizes Gino s morality and conscience traveling and finding work at a carnival together Finally Gino has steady employment To his dismay he is not yet over his love for Giovanna a month has passed when Bregana and his wife go to the carnival and Bregana persuades Gino to go back home to live and work with them again as he is handy to have around br br Too weak willed to resist knowing this will reunite he and Giovanna Gino agrees and goes back to stay with the couple After a while he gives in to Gina s demands to get rid of her husband Once the evil deed is done Giovanna becomes more cold blooded than ever seeming to have very little conscience while guilt and shame eat away at Gino for hurting a man who never did him any harm As much as he wants to leave her he does again briefly they are now inextricably linked and must face the consequences br br I liked the way the Spagnolo character came back into Gino s life to act as a judge of his misdeeds that was very good and interesting adding another dimension to the story br br While the 46 U S version with Lana Turner and John Garfield gets a bit lost in a quagmire of peripheral characters especially the cops and the lawyers Ossessione does well to concentrate much more on the psychological effects of the crime on the lovers alone This gives the final outcome even more potency and makes a powerful statement reinforcing the helplessness inherent in the society in which the characters must live br br A minor quibble The amount of time hardly any that elapses before undying love is pronounced by the lovers how quickly they kill the husband there is no botched first attempt as in the U S version Gino s very quick to escalate relationship with the dancer hooker they quickly profess their love as well and she is willing to risk a great deal for a man she just met all rather unrealistic isn t it I found this time frame problem quite distracting it made me think that I must have missed something somewhere Otherwise well worth the viewer s time The acting and direction were both uniformly good throughout Recommended
Visconti s first feature Ossessione is an adaptation of James M Cain s The Postman Always Rings Twice Now I m not familiar with that book or the other film versions but I am a big fan of Cain s Double Indemnity much more so than I am a fan of Billy Wilder s film version of it in fact The two novellas seem like they must be very similar Both involve an illicit love affair where a ravenous wife complains to a morally weak man that her husband is worthless and mean to her Giovanna the woman in this Italian version played very well by Clara Calamai is not evil incarnate like the wife in Double Indemnity but she seems very spoiled Her husband a great performance by Juan de Landa is a bit cruel to her but she strikes me like she is at least as uncompromising with him He s older than her and unattractive so she s rather fickle When Gino shows up a young muscular man it takes her about five minutes to get him into bed She sweats she wants to be with him forever but she s stuck with her husband They break up at first but when they meet again they apparently although this is intentionally vague plan to murder the husband They are successful and they move back to the woman s home town to run the bar that her husband owned Gino is very unenthusiastic about this idea He wants Giovanna but the one thing that he certainly doesn t want is to sit around in one place for the rest of his life Their relationship quickly crumbles Ossessione is a very complex film with complex characters It s always fascinating but it does go on a bit too long At two hours and twenty two minutes I can t for the life of me figure out how it took that long This is partly due to the neorealist stylistics that Visconti was inventing within this film It was after all the first film that won that label We see a lot of the action prolonged as it would be in real life without any hurrying to the next plot point I ve seen many of Visconti s films and the only one I like better than this one is Rocco and His Brothers 1960 His direction is as great as it ever was with the camera moving brilliantly and the editing perfect I also feel the need to point out the film s best performance by Dhia Christiani as a young exotic dancer and part time prostitute named Anita whom Gino meets after he begins to try to break away from Giovanna She s only in the film for maybe five or six minutes and she has only a few lines It s shocking how much Visconti and Christiani are able to do with this character in such a short time She s absolutely heartbreaking 9 10
This is a haunting powerful Italian adaptation of James M Cain s novel The Postman Always Rings Twice directed by the great Luchino Visconti What is so interesting about the film is that in every way it transcends it s source material to become something bolder and more original interestingly Camus also credits Cain s novel as the key inspiration for his landmark novel The Stranger The film has a greater power and intensity than the novel because Visconti is able to create the filmic equivalent of Cain s narrative structure but offer a more complex exploration of gender Cain s very American novel is also uncritically fascinated with the construction of whiteness the lead character Cora is obsessively afraid she will be identified as a Mexican and embarrassed that she married a Greek immigrant which is not relevant to the Italian rural context that Visconti is working in This allows the class antagonisms to take center stage and dance among the embers of the passionate doomed love affair of the two main characters This film is a complex suspenseful rewarding experience
Watching Ossessione today more than 6 decades later is still a powerful experience especially for those interested in movie history and more specifically on how Italian filmmakers changed movies forever roughly from Ossessione and De Sica s I Bambini Ci Guardano both 1943 up to 20 years later with Fellini Antonioni Pasolini Visconti makes an amazing directing d√©but taking the uncredited plot of The Postman Always Rings Twice as a guide to the development of his own themes br br It strikes us even today how ahead of its time Ossessione was Shot in Fascist Italy during World War II think about it it depicted scenes and themes that caused the film to be immediately banned from theaters and the fact that it used the plot of a famous American novel and payed no copyright didn t help br br Ossessione alarmingly reveals poverty ridden war time Italy far from the idealized Italy depicted in Fascist Telefoni Bianchi movies but it s also extremely daring in its sexual frankness with shirtless hunk Gino Massimo Girotti who definitely precedes Brando s Kowalski in A Streetcar Named Desire taking Giovanna Clara Calamai a married woman to bed just 5 minutes after they first meet We watch Calamai s unglamorous matter of fact undressing and the subtle but undeniable homosexual hints between Gino and Lo Spagnolo Elio Marcuzzo a very appealing actor his face not unlike Pierre Cl√©menti s who was shot by the Nazis in 1945 at 28 years old In a few words sex lust greed and poverty as relentlessly as it had rarely if ever been shown before in Italian cinema br br All the copies of Ossessione were destroyed soon after its opening it was called scandalous and immoral Visconti managed to save a print and when the film was re released after the war most critics called it the front runner of the Neo Realist movement preceding Rossellini s Roma CItt√† Aperta and De Sica s Sciusci√† Some other critics perhaps more appropriately saw Ossessione as the Italian counterpart to the poetic realism of French cinema remember Visconti had been Renoir s assistant especially Marcel Carn√© s Quai des Brumes and Le Jour se L√®ve and Julien Duvivier s P√©p√© le Moko br br While Ossessione may be Neo Realistic in its visual language the depiction of war time paesan life in Italy with its popular fairs poverty child labor prostitution bums swindlers etc the characters and the themes were already decidedly Viscontian He was always more interested in tragic passionate obsessive greedy characters in social political sexual apartheid in the decadence of the elites than in realistic everyday life characters and themes favored by DeSica and Rossellini In Ossessione we already find elements of drama and tragedy later developed in many of his films especially Senso Visconti s definitive departure from Neo Realist aesthetics and Rocco e Suoi Fratelli Even in his most Neo Realist film La Terra Trema he makes his fishermen rise from day to day characters to mythological figures br br Ossessione is a good opportunity to confirm the theory about great artists whose body of work approaches analyzes and develops specific themes and concerns over and over again from their first to their last opus no matter if the scenery background or time setting may change Visconti may play with the frame but the themes and essence of his art are well obsessively recurrent Ossessione is not to be missed you ll surely be fascinated by this ground breaking powerful film
Well when watching this film late one night I was simple amazed by it s greatness Fantastic script great acting costumes and special effects and the plot twists wow In fact if you can see the ending coming you should become a writer yourself br br Great I would recommend this film to anyone especially if I don t like them much br br Terrific
When I started watching the show I said Oh no It s as corny as Elfen Lied and not even that bloody And indeed the setup is almost identical with the single young boy living in a big house all by himself then suddenly getting involved into a fantastic adventure while sexy young girls come live with him br br But this is where the resemblance stops The love story is almost as subtle and intense as the one in Inuiyasha while the childish remarks and behaviors are very few The magical setup is a bit corny because it s about seven people with seven servants fighting for the Holy Grail all servants being someone famous half of all masters being from the same school rules of engagement etc However this soon dims and fades from the beauty of the drawing and of the script br br I actually watched all 24 episodes in one day and without comparing it with animes that I liked more but were from other genres I have to say that I was very pleased
This anime seriously rocked my socks When the anime first opened itself I felt it was too slow the story wasn t quite moving forward and Shirou was quite an unimpressive male lead Once he learns more about tracing and you learn more about Saber and the Holy Grail War itself the story pans out and you can see multiple facets of it moving together It was fantastic br br Additionally I felt that the way the characters developed was very true to form with the way real people develop in the real world There wasn t any stupid completely obvious things going on the development of Ilya and Rin was interesting to watch but I think the way Shirou and Saber grew in their certain personalities was just interesting to watch all on its on A few of the surprise people that show up Gilgamesh seemed to also be unique from the rest of the cast in one way or another meaning we didn t have Generic Bad ass A being replaced by Generic Bad ass B as soon as A died br br Anddd I loved the music The opening music rocked and the finishing theme from the final episode just Seriously pushed forward the theme of the last episode even more Good job Type MOON
Fate Stay Night is an animated series inspired by a h game Somehow the producers turned it around making this a successful series without any of the h stuff It couldn t have been any other way because the development of the characters is great just the way it s pictured in this series and any alteration of that could only ruin perfection You ll understand once you see all the episodes br br Despite a relatively slow start the producer took his time on presenting the characters things gain momentum quickly and soon after mid series the action gets so intense that glues you to your seat br br The topic of the series concentrates on the War of Holy Grail that has been taking place in the Fukuky City for the last 50 years The pilot actually starts with the conclusion of the previous war and develops from there on Shiro is the only survivor of the fire that started during the last battle and enveloped a large portion of the city He unwillingly witnesses a fight between two Servants that triggers his Reiju Holy mark to summon one of the most powerful Servants of the battlefield Saber His first contact with Saber left him stunned Such immeasurable beauty I was at a lost for words br br You mustn t compare this series with any other to fully understand it s plot FSN offers much more than some cool sword fights good animation spectacular lights great soundtrack it offers excellent character and relationship development It presents the changes that take place within the characters personalities as the events precipitate The action reveals believable dynamic emotional and behavioral patterns of the individuals not similar to the linear type other series use that are constantly shaping their personalities to reveal from under the mask of perfection flawed characters br br The Saber character is tied to a medieval legend that has been altered to fit this series and should be accepted as such You shouldn t watch FSN thinking that it doesn t present the viewer with the historic fact just remember that this is adventure fantasy series and not a documentary and enjoy this as long as you can The ending is sudden and unexpected and if there were twice as many episodes I would have watched them in the same breath
I have to agree with everyone else that has posted br br I watched it quite a while ago but I ll tell you whenever I hear certain music from this anime I am reminded of the story the beautiful animation the characters and the feeling I got when watching it and it does make me cry such a happy yet sad feeling I do however find that the love story in it felt alittle rushed and they didn t explain things properly but it didn t ruin any part of the viewing experience br br I was into this anime so much that after the end I just had to do some research and watch the ending a few more times and I found all my answers and a whole lot more I love how they configured historical legends to fit into this anime it was amazing and just made me want to research a whole lot more I ve always been very interested in certain historical figures associated with this anime br br I do think it should have been a longer series but if this is all they had to work with then they pulled it off nicely I d recommend this to anyone who likes emotional anime with an excellent story well built characters some mysterious and a bit of fantasy action br br Also even though this was based on a H game it doesn t have any of that stuff in it and I actually prefer it this way I have no problem with mature anime in most cases I prefer it
When I first heard about this series on AnimeTV I have to say that out of all the shows that I have seen this one tops it all off I had to see this show and that is what I really did When I got the first volume of this show it was the best I really liked the animation and all the fight scenes were awesome I have to say that my favorite characters in the show were Saber and Archer and of course I also like Illya And of course all the episodes on the volumes were interesting and very cool Another thing I have to say about the series is Michael McConnohie famous for Transformers and others playing the voice of Berserker He does have a cool character And I even watched the entire series all over again before watching the final volume So if you to see something good then see this show it s the best
I ve watched the first 17 episodes and this series is simply amazing I haven t been this interested in an anime series since Neon Genesis Evangelion This series is actually based off an h game which I m not sure if it s been done before or not I haven t played the game but from what I ve heard it follows it very well br br I give this series a 10 10 It has a great story interesting characters and some of the best animation I ve seen It also has some great Japanese music in it too br br If you haven t seen this series yet check it out You can find subbed episodes on some anime websites out there it s straight out of Japan
this movie probably had a 750 budget and still managed to surpass Titanic i rented this the day i crashed my mom s car and it was the only thing that cheered me up beyond belief it has to be tied with The Assult of the Killer Bimbos Things to look for are 1 The drive in blow job chinese girl scene 2 The bleach blonde in the sassoon shirt who never changes 3 The Flinstone like screech out driving 4 The clashing ensemble worn by the redhead right before she gets killed don t worry i m not ruining any surprises for it s soooo predictable 5 The guy who finds it necessary to howl 6 The mental patient who plays a convincing job of being insane by poking out the eyes of a maniquen 7 The hour long chase at the end involving the teacher and the priest 8 the womman writing grafitti on the bathroom wall 9 last but not least the wonderful special effects especially the stab in the boob that made a heaven help me popping noise br br enjoy br br
This movie is great If you enjoy watching B class movies that is This is a classic college 80 s slasher movie in which one song is played throughout the entire soundtrack A horrible film but worth renting to make fun of or just to watch old men pop out of closets with knives Kinda funny if you ask me
The combination of the superb black and white photography and the Eugene Onegin with a twist plot made this a real knock out for me The atmosphere created by the mostly very dark shots contrasted with occasional very bright overexposed white was gripping There was a superb moment where where transparencies apparently conventional holiday snaps but where the faces of the actors revealed character and situation subtly but instantly were shown accompanied by Lensky s heart wrenching aria from the Tschaikowsky opera Eugene Onegin br br For me the mark of a good film is that it should take advantage of the opportunities presented by that medium which means that often the story is less important than imagery and atmosphere Last Year in Marienbad is a good example of such a film Krisana is in the same mould
This is a lovely tale of guilt driven obsession br br Matiss on a lonely night stroll in Riga passes by a woman on the wrong side of a bridge railing He passes by without a word Only the splash in the water followed by a cry for help causes him to act And then only too little and too late br br The film chronicles his efforts at finding out more about the woman On a troll of local bars he finds her pocketbook He pieces more and more of her life together His look changes as his obsession grows He has to make things right In a marvelously filmed dialog with the bastard ex boyfriend he forces Alexej to face up to the guilt that both feel br br Haunting long takes a gritty soundtrack to accentuate the guilt barking dogs Footsteps Lovely film noir with a lovely twist A good Indie ending
I am normally not compelled to write a review for a film but the only commentary for this film thus far on is rather unfair so I feel it necessary to share my point of view br br Krisana or as it was titled at the theater I saw it Fallen follows Matiss a lonely Latvian archivist as he tries to learn about a woman whom he didn t try to stop from jumping off a bridge as well as her reasons for doing so That s the plot in a nutshell but this film is not concerned with story as much it is in depicting the guilt of a man who failed to act As a detective who investigates the incident tells him we usually don t bother to care about the anonymous faces we pass every day until after they die br br Comparisons to Michaelango Antonioni and his Blowup will most likely abound in any review you read about Krisana The influence of Antonioni s philosophical and austere style and the story of Blowup are clear and in fact writer director Fred Kelemen makes an obvious reference to that film in scenes in which Matiss attempts to come to know the woman who jumped off the bridge or at least who he thinks did br br The only other person to share his or her views on the film detracts the college film class look and sound of the film He or she neglects to consider the budgetary constraints that an existentialist Latvian film most likely faces but the atmospheric black and white cinematography and ambient sound succeeds at an artistic level to depict the solitude of Matiss The background sound of wind and street noises lend an ominous aura and reminds one of a Fellini film whether or not that was Kelemen s intention The filmmakers undoubtedly had little money but this constraint is used to the film s advantage br br Krisana succeeds as a character study with enough humor thrown in to keep it from being too self serious It could have easily fell into the trappings of a mystery story but it avoids that and becomes an intelligent film about loneliness and guilt If you are more concerned with plot this film and its ending may frustrate you Otherwise take the time to be engaged by it It is well worth seeking out
A very realistic portrait of a broken family and the effect it has on the kid caught in between As a child of divorced parents I was totally relating to events in the film Also a really cool zombie twist which I thought was VERY ORIGINAL I m tired of the same old stuff in movies A very realistic portrait of a broken family and the effect it has on the kid caught in between As a child of divorced parents I was totally relating to events in the film Also a really cool zombie twist which I thought was VERY ORIGINAL I m tired of the same old stuff in movies A very realistic portrait of a broken family and the effect it has on the kid caught in between As a child of divorced parents I was totally relating to events in the film Also a really cool zombie twist which I thought was VERY ORIGINAL I m tired of the same old stuff in movies
Just kidding about the weight loss thing well you might lose weight you never know Anyway what can I say I love this film It has that same sense of youth and innocence found in films like Stand By Me and The Goonies Jake s Closet illustrates the beauty of life s simple things and how often we overlook them The film reminds us what it s like to see the world through children s eyes and all the magic mystery and horror they perceive Jake s Closet presents a tale uniquely human in its compassion that anyone who s had a childhood can both relate to and fall in love with Watch it with friends watch it with loved ones build a fort wine optional
I would say that this film gives an insight to the trauma that a young mind can face when a family is split by divorce or other disaster I would highly recommend this film especially to parents or individuals planning to have a family br br I found the characters to be appealing and highly sympathetic from a multitude of dimensions br br The scary monster although probably not scary to most adults has a very real hint of what the overactive imagination of a child who is facing unknown terrors might create br br I found the film to be delightful
Jake s Closet has the emotional power of Kramer vs Kramer combined with the imagination of Pan s Labyrinth Even the beginning special effect seems to give a nod to Pan s Labyrinth But this is a story that takes place in modern times not in a war sixty years ago and in that way it has even more resonance today Jake s Closet is about a boy an only child practically alone on summer vacation dealing with his family falling apart It s a horror movie like The Others and The Sixth Sense a horror movie for the thinking person If you re looking for a slasher movie this won t be your cup of tea but if you re looking for a story that is both touching and suspenseful with good acting this is the movie for you At the screening I saw I swear there was one moment where the entire audience screamed I highly recommend catching this film
Answer despite that fact that this film was written and directed by a woman your ex is creepier nastier and more irrational than any zombie that ever lurched the earth br br The acting in this independent film actually is quite good despite the less than wonderful script It takes a pretty good actor to deliver an overwritten clich√©d line and make it sound vaguely believable Young Anthony de Marco as Jake puts in a particularly good performance br br Fortunately the plot of this film is a lot better than the dialog Try it especially if you re not a monster fan This is NOT a horror flick Even though all the adult females are pretty monstrous and although all the adult males act as if their brains were eaten in some earlier zombie film Jake s Closet is suitable for mature adults br br The whole this time is much better than the sum of its parts
I d never seen an independent movie and I was really impressed by the writing acting and cinematography of Jake s Closet br br The emotions were very real and intense showing through a child s eyes the harsh impact of divorce br br A definite see br br I d never seen an independent movie and I was really impressed by the writing acting and cinematography of Jake s Closet br br The emotions were very real and intense showing through a child s eyes the harsh impact of divorce br br A definite see
I saw this at Dances with Films and it was awesome I really felt for Jake Talk about adding insult to injury Not only are your parents getting divorced but there s a monster after you br br It was both heartfelt and scary there were several moments where the audience screamed in genuine fright It kind of reminded me of a Japanese horror film except that the story was actually good br br And that s what separated Jake s Closet from the usual indy film pabulum an excellent script with compelling characters Also by mixing elements of the horror film with family drama the movie gets the best out of both genres and avoids the clich√©s of both br br If it s not coming out in theaters definitely get the DVD
Anyone who has experienced the terrors of divorce will empathize with this indie film s protagonist a scared little boy who believes a zombie is hiding in his closet Is Jake a mesmerizing Anthony DeMarco simply transferring the trauma of two bickering parents to an understandable image Or could the creature be real Writer director Shelli Ryan neatly balances both possibilities and keeps the audience guessing Her choice of using one setting a suburban house adds to the feeling of desperation and claustrophobia br br Brooke Bloom and Peter Sean Bridgers are highly convincing as the angry but loving parents However it is the creepy minor characters Mrs Bender Barbara Gruen an unhinged babysitter and Sam Stone Ben Bode a sleazy Real estate agent that linger in the mind Jake s Closet is a darkly inspired portrait of childhood as a special kind of Hell
Every child experiences trauma growing up and every child s active imagination has gotten the best of them but for Jake Anthony De Marco of the forthcoming Clint Eastwood film CHANGELING who resembles Henry Thomas circa 1982 the combination may prove deadly br br A lonely six year old whose imagination kicks into high gear when he is crestfallen to learn his quarrelling parents Peter Sean Bridgers late of DEADWOOD and Jules Brooke Bloom CBS Miami suddenly decide to divorce leaving him to his own devices and unleashing a new tenant a zombie in his closet br br Jake actually gets this seed planted while playing with neighborhood friend Dillon Matthew Josten who provides him with a print out off the internet of FAQ re zombies Jake is so convinced that one is out to get him and his family he begins to hatch a plan of action to protect them before it s too late br br Indie newcomer Shelli Ryan who wrote and directed blends domestic drama with underlings of horror but the former smartly outweighs the latter with a decent story buoyed by fine acting De Marco is the rare breed of child actor where he is a CHILD and not acting all his nuances are very evident of the awkward shy introverted child that many can relate too I certainly can Bridgers makes his cheating husband empathetic in the realization he really loves his son while Bloom has the more difficult job of building sympathy as the somewhat lackadaisical mother who is quick to emotions over rationality it doesn t help when Dillon s mother Ruth Monette Magrath who resembles Laura Dern is constantly feeding her implied information driving a wedge between Jake and his dad Magrath also has a tough task to make her manipulative character relatively likable but she proves to in a revealing scene that I won t go into detail but shows why she is the way she is and more importantly how she has also affected her own child br br The fillmmaker s subjective camera is also well employed many angles shown form Jake s POV at waist level or somewhat skewed i e the upside down shot of Peter carrying his son in the same position while having some fun in the backyard and the editing is relatively flawless br br Ryan based the screenplay on personal experiences growing up and also witnessing first hand account of a friend going through the same situation and how the affects of adult relationships can be harmful if inflicting their fears anger and stress onto their children Here the film is very successful in getting its theme across br br However the horror underpinnings are a little disjointed to say the least but the homage to George A Romero s zombie films are shown lovingly by Ryan Jake s mom is asleep in front of the TV as NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD unspools causing his own belief of the undead to be in their home The metaphor of a monster acting as surrogate to domestic abuse may be a bit heavy handed but again the child s fear of a thing under his bed is universal

I used to watch Pufnstuf every weekend when I was about 10 It was on right after Bay City Rollers I saw it come on to Family Channel one day and taped it for my then three year old daughter I d forgotten all the things I d loved as a child the magic flute the zoom broom Witcheepoo s makeup br br This show is decidedly low tech The mayor is surely a precedent to Mayor McCheese and everyone is a stuffed creature with annoying googly eyes But kids love this stuff They would way way rather watch a guy work a sock puppet than sit in front of high tech computer animation There is mild slapstick but no adult themes such as sex or people dying and kids accept Jimmy s schemes Kids think it would be neat to carry a bag of smoke around and convince someone their house was on fire and I loved how every time my daughter saw a jet stream in the sky she thought Witchypoo was flying overhead The music is old but you really get used to it and my daughter really loved it She used to sing different is hard different is lonely in the car My daughter watched this show at least once a day for about 5 months and it s still one of her favourites br br I see that a new Pufnstuf 2000 is in the works I really hope they try to keep the old flavour and don t do anything like computer animating characters etc I think a whole new generation would love Pufnstuf
I remember seeing this on TV in the late 70s and it stayed with me It s charming loud colourful a great kids film I put it on for some friends at a party recently and naturally they thought I was mad and expected something sick to happen to the puppets a la Meet the feebles But no its wholesome clean fun br br jack wild is in fine form as is mama cass and the somehow attractive witchy poo br br If you like the banana splits and you are in your 30 s this will re create that surreal childhood Saturday morning vibe br br Even if I ve realised now that Puf himself is a bit crap as all he does is get captured and run away Quality TV movie if like me you are into death metal you ll love it
Pufnstuf is what it is I saw this in the cinema at age 4 and I have very fond and vivid memories of it Seeing this as as adult allows one to catch the references that are way over the heads of the target audience like the bit where Jimmy s grey witch wig is ripped off and Witch Hazel Cass sneers I KNEW she had brown roots It is of course heavily influenced by the flower power culture of the time and in some ways quite progressive The track Different for example sends a clear message to the young viewers about being yourself not running with the pack and cherishing what is is about yourself that is different This could be an anthem to the gay community it should be great track br br Martha Raye Cass Elliot and Billie Hayes are all great as witches and the Living Island cast give it their all in the confines of their character suits includes Billy Barty Felix Silla and other famous names There is a LOT of over acting in this film there s really nothing subtle and when little Jack Wild has to emote his concern for the kidnapped residents of Living Island it s really little more than yelling This is drama and comedy spread on with a trowel While I think of it I never could stand the flute though br br I love the soundtrack especially the above mentioned Different but also Zap The World Pufnstuf and even Jack Wild s touching If I Could What s more it IS now out on CD from the tasteful people at El Records in London See here for more www cherryred co uk el artists pufnstuf htm
This is why I still have nightmares br br This terrifying film a musical was considered appropriate for children in the 1970s br br A boy leaves on a magical journey to an island The mayor of the island Pufnstuf allegedly a dragon looking more like a newt with conjunctivitis to me and a magic talking flute are targeted by a witch Billie Halliday who was considered a bit of alright at the time br br The flute is recovered at an interesting witches convention with the witches having a gay old time The boy dresses in drag then as a fairy to recover the flute br br Not suitable for children
I grew up with H R Pufnstuff and the dashingly talented Jack Wild and now my daughters are adoring fans of Jack Wild too This movie is exactly what movies should be fun and entertaining This movie is not limited to children either A lot of the dialogue is directed to adults and Witchiepoo s performance is something you do not want to miss The music in this movie suited Jack Wild and Mama Cass beautifully And as a Jack Wild fan I would never miss the chance to watch him dance or hear him sing Knowing the hard life that Jack had now makes this movie even more wonderful especially when he sings the opening song If I Could It makes me pause in loving adoration for him for giving me wonderful childhood memories that I am now passing on to my children Let s all go to Living Island where there is friendship and fun And keep Jack Wild s memory alive by passing Pufnstuff on to others
i two came home from school fast as i could to catch HRpuff and stuff on t v that was the most fun time in my life is to watch HRpuff and stuff on t v growing up still love it today i am 46 years old this year
I absolutely LOVED this movie when I was a kid I cried every time I watched it It wasn t weird to me I totally identified with the characters I would love to see it again and hope I wont be disappointed Pufnstuf rocks I was really drawn in to the fantasy world And to me the movie was loooong I wonder if I ever saw the series and have confused them The acting I thought was strong I loved Jack Wilde He was so dreamy to an 10 year old when I first saw the movie not in 1970 I can still remember the characters vividly The flute was totally believable and I can still feel the evil woods Witchy poo was scary I wouldn t want to cross her path
This film may have a questionable pedigree because it was made for TV but it is one of the best movies I ve seen The film and its actors won several awards It is gripping fascinating and it will absorb you completely The story of a chase for a killer in iron curtain Russia by people who are willing to risk their careers to try to save lives of future victims would be a compelling story if it were fiction but it s ostensibly a true story I highly recommend it
Steven Rea plays a forensic scientist thrust on the job in Sovie Russia in 1982 in the very first hours of his job a body of a murdered girl is brought in he has his workers go back to look for evidence and they bring back five more bodies this starts the story of the hunt for one of the worst serial killers in modern day history It is a stark depressing dark movie that explores how the bureaucracy of the old Soviet Union indirectly contributed or caused the deaths of many of the killers victims It also explores in Donald Sutherland s character how the proper usage of bureaucracy in a communist govt can help achieve the ultimate goal of finding a monster A gripping movie not for all but for those who like a good detective story that will hold your interest this is definitely a must see on a scale of one to ten 9
Excellent film The whole picture was filmed in Budapest so I feel proud My little problem was that the trains in the film belonged to the Hungarian State Railways M√ÅV and it is plain to see that they were used in big train not in the local railway according to the story Chikatilo picked up his victims in local railway stations Apart from this the film is superb
This is a fascinating account of the hunt for the Soviet Union s first known serial killer I had tuned in just expecting a half decent TV movie but found myself drawn by the compelling way the story was told As others have said there is much to admire here that is sadly lacking in many big screen releases br br Much of the credit must go to Chris Gerolmo whose intelligent screenplay and direction draw the viewer in until it is impossible not to feel emotionally involved The acting by the whole cast is also superb especially that of the two leads Stephen Rea and Donald Sutherland Their convincing portrayals give their character arcs a great deal of credibility and the scene where they have their first committee meeting after Perestroika is genuinely touching br br If you prefer your crime films with a bit more depth and a little less sheen I strongly recommend you look out for Citizen X br br
This movie was excellent It details the struggle between a committed detective against the dedicated ignorance of the corrupted communist regime in Russia during the 80 s I give this movie high marks for it s no holds barred look into the birth and development of forensic investigation in a globally isolated thanks to the Regime community This is a graphic movie It presents an unsensationalized picture of violence and it s tragic remains Nothing is candy coated with overdone blood or gore to separate us from the cruel reality on the screen This movie is based on Russian serial killer Andrei Chikatilo I m familiar enough with the true story to have a very deep appreciation for how real they kept the film It s not a comedy but for those who appreciate dry and dark humor this movie is a must see
CitizenX 1995 is the developing world s answer to Silence of the Lambs Where Silence terrorized our peace of mind Citizen exhausts and saddens us instead This dramatization of the Chikatilo case translates rather well thanks to a Westernized friendship between two Rostov cops who become equals br br CitizenX may also argue against the death penalty far better than Kevin Spacey s The Life of David Gayle 2002 br br Humans are Machiavellian mammals under which lie limbic brains lizard logic Why did two kids who knew better stone to death a toddler they kidnapped Why do bloodthirsty women yell li lilililililii at acts of OBSCENE terrorism My own term for this is limbic domination the lizard logic urge to dominate an enemy If you have the words enemy vengeance in your vocabulary you re easily capable of limbic domination br br In WWII devastated 1980s Rostov located at the mouth of the Don river near the Black Sea nothing suppressed Andrei Chikatilo s urge for limbic domination from overpowering his layers of civilization Chikatilo Jeffrey DeMunn s easy victims were paupers usually children who rode the interurban train for fun since they couldn t afford anything else br br CitizenX reminds us that the denials of a rampant Soviet bureaucracy cost the lives of 52 such lambs Rostov s serial killer roamed free for almost 7 years AFTER the police arrested and let him go br br The politicization of crimefighting is harmful to police forces everywhere Although policing routinely suffers from corruption all over the world in the west vote grabbing by politicians can set up chronic inter agency rivalries stymieing a more coordinated response to crime In the Soviet Union of CitizenX however Viktor Burakov Stephen Rea s Killer Department was suffering from a repressive bureaucracy br br Geoffrey DeMunn plays the psychosexually inadequate Chikatilo with faultless but understated authority to the point of complete obscurity In real life too Chikatilo had a lifetime s experience blending in and evading capture br br His pursuer on the other hand sticks out as a strange bird given to unheralded naive outbursts Perhaps by design Stephen Rea gives a very strange performance as forensics chief Burakov Rea s Russian accent is impenetrable and his Burakov is humourless and sullen at odds with everyone br br So it s Donald Sutherland who walks away with the picture Sutherland s Col Fetisov Burakov s boss and at first his only supporter is an overly restrained patient Militiaman whose dignified carriage bears testimony to decades of bureaucratic machinations His reawakening as a logic driven yet still passionate cop becomes the film s cornerstone idealism br br Joss Ackland does another turn as a vicious apparatchik Secretary of Communist Ideology Bondarchuk overseeing the investigation Naturally he quashed the arrest of the most likely suspect a Communist in 1984 a man carrying rope and a knife in his bag supposedly going home Andrei Chikatilo br br Soon he replaced Burakov with another Moscow apparatchik Detective Gorbunov John Wood insisting that the investigation now focus on known homosexuals The funniest scene of this sad sad film comes during Bondarchuk s Gorbunov s institutionalized harassment one stupid cop earnestly reports As I suspected comrade it s fornication I ve made some drawings cue howling laughter br br 5yrs after the bodies began piling up in 1987 the police finally tried soliciting criminal profiles The only cooperating Soviet psychiatrist was Dr Aleksandr Bukhanovsky Max Von Sydow who termed the UNSUB CitizenX He later also observed to Fetisov Burakov that together you make a wonderful person We concur br br The drawn out pace spread over a decade perfectly captures the institutional inertia of Glasnost openness that wasn t The contrast with Perestroika restructuring couldn t ve been greater for the case Although Chikatilo was still prowling railway stations police plans were about to bear fruit br br In 1990 Col Fetisov was expeditiously promoted to General His nemesis Bondarchuk disappeared off the scene allowing the investigation to finally proceed without political interference Staff communications publicity suddenly all were available In just one night of telephoning around Fetisov got his depressed forensics chief access to the FBI s Serial Murder Task Force at Quantico where Fetisov discovered staff are regularly rotated off serial murder cases to stave off just such psychological damage to investigators br br Fetisov advises his newly promoted forensics chief now Colonel Burakov of all these changes in an avalanche of confession that becomes the movie s powerhouse watershed scene Fetisov s is the most tender apology I ve ever seen on film Privately I offer my deepest apologies to you and your wife I hope that someday you can forgive me my ignorance he almost whispers br br A HBO production CitizenX is a film of the highest caliber Not only do the exteriors look authentically bleak shot exclusively in the most run down parts of otherwise spectacular Budapest but Randy Edelman s soaring soundtrack is entirely overwhelming and frequently our only respite from the bleak brutality Those who speak Hungarian will recognize the many Hungarian accents and credits br br Chikatilo s actual murders are depicted as bleak aberrant behaviour born of character flaws and ignorance in an equally bleak world This makes the murders seem not entirely out of place but of course they were As President Kennedy reminded us we all cherish the futures of our children br br CitizenX communicates perfectly that killing is far more grisly and obscene than any vengeance fantasy might imply Serial rapists rape to dominate serial killers kill to dominate So do some soldiers Such limbic dominators make poor humans br br WARNING SPOILER The real Andrei Chikatilo WAS the world s most prolific known serial killer Convicted he was executed in 1992 in the manner of all Soviet Union death sentences one shot in the back of the head Foolishly such methods destroy any possibility of studying a deviant brain after death br br Conclusion The best outcome is always the prevention of killings not their prosecution Executions merely guarantee society s failure to learn from the complex reality of victims deaths when we dispatch even anecdotal evidence of HOW WHY they died Nor do killers learn regret if they re dead br br Vengeance doesn t unkill victims Baying for the killer s blood constitutes nothing better than counter domination once it s too late br br Vengeance on behalf of the grieving isn t justice for the deceased it s appeasement of the living 10 10
I was surprised at how fascinating this movie was The performances were extremely good especially by Rea as the compassionate no nonsense detective br br Despite a low budget no big FX or flashy camerawork Citizen X somehow manages to surpass the majority of similar big Hollywood films by just Telling The Story br br True stories tend to end with a whimper rather than a bang and that s the case here but apart from that this is a highly recommended detective yarn
This is an excellent movie It is about many things the hunt for a serial killer the bureacracy of Soviet Russia the drive of one man and the relationship between this man the lead detective and his superior br br The thing that sticks with me the most is the relationship between Durokov Rea and Fetisov Sutherland excuse bad spelling please For some reason it is moving to see their evolution from hostility and offense turning into respect and cameraderie and working together One line in the movie sums it up for me He would say something witty but he is overcome with emotion br br Excellent acting by all of the cast even the smallest parts were done with believability br br This is not a fast paced action thriller in fact it moves at times like a slow drama but it is worth it Very satisfying and not exploitative about the crimes at all br br
Citizen X is the superbly told true story of the hunt for one of history s worst serial killers What makes this story even more compelling is where and when it took place the Soviet Union in the 1980 s br br Mild Spoilers br br Viktor Burakov magnificently played by Stephen Rea is a newly promoted forensic investigator for the Rostov oblast militia He discovers past and present unsolved murders apparently by the same person The murders are unsolved because no one has ever taken the trouble to properly investigate the evidence He is driven to find and stop the killer His only tools are his dedication skill and honesty His obstacles are the corruption and political ideology of the Soviet system that discourages the search for truth His naivet√© would have led to failure were it not for his boss Col Mikhail Fetisov Donald Sutherland Fetisov is a politically astute cynic who understands the game and knows how to deal with the Soviet bureaucracy However he also shares Burakov s desire to bring a murderer to justice even if the official party line is There are no serial killers in the Soviet Union br br The cast is outstanding The locations and sets are perfect recreations of latter day Soviet life Randy Edelman s score is particularly good br br More important this film shows a dark and disturbing criminal phenomenon with both intensity and poignancy This was a made for cable movie by HBO Films and they have become a great resource for films that would otherwise never be made
The poor DVD video quality is the only reason why I gave this movie a 9 instead of a 10 That could have been so much better this movie deserves it br br This is truly a movie that covers several themes simultaneously If you do not like movies about serial killers but are fascinated by the astonishing bureaucratic culture in the former Sovjet Union this movie is a must see anyway br br I can t compare it to Silence of the Lambs for several reasons The way the serial killer is portrayed has been done far much better in Citizen X You see several details of his private life because you travel along with the killer which gives you some idea of the source of his constant anger and sexual frustration br br The only other movie I have seen that is as realistic as this one was Henry portrait of a serial killer If you were fascinated by that movie you definitely need to take a look at Citizen X
Citizen X tells the real life drama of the search for a serial killer dubbed The Rostov Ripper This great film shows the long journey it took to try to apprehend a killer The film shows how politics may haver helped the killer to continue his rampage for over 12 years Possibly over 50 victims mostly women and children The performances of Stephen Rea as the lead detective and Donald Sutherland as the overall investigation lead was superb Jeffrey DeMunn as the Ripper Andrei Romanovich Chikatilo This is the type of film which will mesmerize you and immediately have you on the internet researching the real case This a film not to be missed It debuted I believe on HBO and never did get a theatrical release to my understanding Great film
Chris Gerolmo took care not to simply give us a Jack the stripper type of list of murdered people he delved into the psychological characterization with convincing results Perhaps mostly due to Stephen Rea s excellent performance playing off against Donald Sutherland with good empathy by both It was the playing of these two parts above all which made the film something more than just a morbid account of the history of the butcher of Rostov Supporting actors especially Max von Sydow carried out their parts really well Good directing The photography was good too Needless to say the fact that the film was shot in Hungary was bound to produce a couple of aberrations but frankly given the depth of the story telling and interpretations we can completely forget these little trivialia br br For once a made for TV film from HBO has come up trumps Recommended especially if you like to analyse characteriology and forget some of the morbid scenes which I hasten to add are never exaggerated
Though I saw this movie years ago its impact has never left me Stephen Rea s depiction of an invetigator is deep and moving His anguish at not being able to stop the deaths is palpable Everyone in the cast is amazing from Sutherland who tries to accommodate him and provide ways for the police to coordinate their efforts to the troubled citizen x Each day when we are bombarded with stories of mass murderers I think of this film and the exhausting work the people do who try to find the killers
I believe this is the most powerful film HBO Pictures has made to date This film should have been released in theaters for the public to view on the big screen It is available on video so make sure you look for it and check it out Chris Gerolmo did a great job with the direction and the screenplay The performances from Stephen Rea Donald Sutherland and Jeffery DeMunn are flawless A masterpiece of the genre
Imagine being so hampered by a bureaucracy that a one man spends 8 year s of his life and has a mental breakdown trying to solve a mass murder case virtually by himself The murder technique is clear but a government unwilling to admit the truth let s a monster destroy dozens of lives When I think my job is stressful I merely remember the true story behind this wonder flick The devotion to duty of the main character was masterfully portrayed by Rea The comic and almost tragic at times relationship between Rea and the Sutherland character made this one of my favorite movies of the last 5 years The catching of one of the worst mass murderers in history had me on the edge of my seat While not nearly as well advertised and talked about as Silence of the Lamb s the plot was just as suspenseful Rent or buy this movie today
Rea Sutherland DeMunn and von Sydow in a small role are all brilliant in their performances Sutherland is particularly adept at this sort of role where he must portray a character whose morality is at first uncertain to the audience As is so often the case with Sutherland s characters we must ask is he a villian in this case a minor one or a hero br br This is a disturbing story intelligently told about the incompetence and fearful bureaucracy in the old Soviet Union that impeded the efforts of extremely competent people As Sutherland s character wryly notes The measure of a bureaucracy is its ability not to make special exceptions The committee meeting between Rea and Sutherland s characters after perestroika is enforced with its revelations has enormous emotional impact You can feel the suffering of the dedicated people who labored in that system br br The handful of dramatic scenes portraying victims family members adds emotional resonance to the impact of the story This is seldom a feature of a film with this sickening subject matter but effectively reminds us that the victims had lives and were loved br br This is a sad but very important film which deserved its showcase on Canada s History Television
Okay let s start off by saying this film is not an exact rendition of the crimes and legal pursuit of Andrei Chikatilo While it may have been official policy in the Politburo that the USSR had no serial killers in actuality the legal system had handled others and Killer X as he was actually called was already being sought when Fetisov brought Burakov onto the case In fact as soon as it was realized they had multiple murders on their hands the authorities assigned a task force of dozens of officers to track down and end the killing spree of a man that did not fit into what is perceived as normal serial killer parameters It s good the director and writers consistently remind the viewer that the story is only based upon actual events for a docudrama this ain t br br SPOILERS FOLLOW br br That said this is a damn good example of a fast paced Hollywood style thriller that still gets across the basics of what happened It is easy to follow and has just enough truth behind its version of events to make for compelling viewing Yes Chikatilo raped and murdered both children and adults both male and female Yes shoddy lab work set him free to continue killing for years Yes innocent men were accused of the murders and confessed to their crimes at police urging Yes the gay community was harassed while the crimes were being committed albeit with Burakov s committed assistance And yes Chikatilo was brought to confession not by the haranguing of the special prosecutor Gorbunov but by the gentle understanding of a psychiatrist named Bukhanovsky though Gorbunov was really nowhere near the egotistical martinet portrayed in this film Quibbles about truth and veracity aside all of these events are dramatized in a manner that consistently tightens the tension and fear br br It doesn t hurt that director and co writer Chris Gerolmo has a pitch perfect cast Stephen Rea s growing emotional involvement in the killings and developing expertise in detecting clues Donald Sutherland s snarky manipulation of the Soviet party hacks and subtle spine that becomes evident when it is needed Jeffrey DeMunn s seething undercurrent of rage hidden by a fear filled demeanor Max Von Sydow s boyish excitement at being part of a criminal investigation all enhance the sharp dialog and crisp editing in ways that cannot be underestimated br br Taken for what it is Citizen X is almost pitch perfect the almost due to one moment of self congratulation at the end that just does NOT fit Highly recommended as fiction well told not fact being presented but considering the junky serial killer movies that Hollywood usually spits out that s good enough for me
A superb and compelling drama about the hunt for the notorious Russian serial killer Andrea Chikatilo Magnificent performance from Stephen Rea as the forensic scientist put in charge of the investigation who finds the biggest obstacle to his progress is the Russian government in particular the old communist party members who want to maintain a closed society br br The film is has an underlying theme about the decline of the communist society and progress in the hunt for the killer is reflected by progress in social and political change in Russia which is subtly put across There is a conflict of old ways and new ways and these are represented by the two viewpoints of Rea s superior played by Donald Sutherland and Rea himself These are at first polarised with Sutherland high in system looking down and Rea low on the ground looking up However they have a common cause to catch the serial killer br br Throughout the film the relationship between these two develops and the tension gradually eases until at the end of the movie Rea and Sutherland and Rea and Sutherland have mutual respect for each other the killer is caught and Glasnost symbolically comes Excellent script br br Further credits go to Sutherland s performance which is superb and sympathetic Jeffrey DeMunn as the killer whom we despise but can t hate and Max Von Sydow who is thoroughly convincing as the humble psychologist who risks his reputation to help
Caution May contain spoilers br br I ve seen this movie 3 times I ve liked it every time Upon seeing it again I m always reminded of how good it is An HBO TV movie very well done like most of their movies are this would ve gotten Oscars for it s performances had it been released for general distribution instead of made for TV br br As I m sure anyone knows from reading other reviews here this is the story of serial murderer Andrei Chikatilo He murdered 56 people over 8 years in the former Soviet Union 3 victims were buried couldn t be found so he was only convicted of 52 out of 53 of his murders The story actually focuses more on the forensic analyst Victor Burakov played to perfection by Stephen Rea A man that becomes tortured and obsessed with finding this killer despite the additional obstacles placed by party hacks his part is essential to be sure There is a very touching scene towards the end of the movie that mentions how in America investigators are routinely taken off serial killer cases after 18 months whether they want to or not due to the mental strain frustration According to this acct Burakov worked for over 5 years before getting his first break from it He followed the case to its conclusion 3 years later In this scene his superior General Fetisov played by Donald Sutherland actually tells him he admires his dedication and apologizes for not knowing he should ve given him a break sooner br br Rea s performance is so well done he doesn t overact chew up the scenery or do anything that distracts from his portrayal of a man who is hell bent on finding his killer He is a man with passion but doesn t show it in the same manner as is so usually portrayed in detective movies He only occasionally gives outbursts after quietly putting up with more than most could stand under such circumstances Rea does so much with his face his eyes he doesn t need to overact He just is His character so frustrated after so long at one point driven to frustration he actually says he d rather find 3 at one time than none in a year Of course what he means is not that he wants more people to die he just wants some clues to catch this man Rea makes us feel for this man He makes us understand but a glimpse of what it is to live with such horror and futility br br A mutant to be sure Chikatilo s childhood was one which produces such monsters The character of Chikatilo is very well done by Jeffrey DeMunn He somehow impossible though it may seem elicits some modicum of sympathy for himself Perhaps he is the worst of us gone terribly wrong Either way his performance is very well done br br Donald Sutherland as Colonel Fetisov later promoted to General also does a great job He starts out seeming to be a cynical worldly official that doesn t seem much more interested in helping the investigation than anyone else blocking Burakov But he eventually becomes more than just an assistant he actually actively participates in helping Burakov There is also a very nice turn by Max Von Sydow as the psychiatrist brought in to help profile and figure out what kind of deviant they are looking for br br Although this movie deals with a morbid grotesque and violent story it really is more about what it takes to catch a killer than the killer himself All around a very well done movie with fine performances and a great screenplay The screenplay manages to do what the best of this type of movie does give factual events place them meaningfully inside a dramatic framework that makes you feel like you know the people behind the facts br br 9 out of 10 stars
A surprisingly complex and well crafted study of The First serial killer in the USSR Set in the days of perestroika this intense piece is brought to full life with the performances of Stephen Reah and Donald Sutherland br br This examination of Cicatillo as a killer is well rounded and by hinting at some of his behaviors while out right showing others there is a subtlety that is compelling without being overtly graphic Not for the weak of heart however as it s subject matter is often disturbing but necessary to it s full development of the main participants in this fact based story br br HBO has furnished us with an excellent film in an unusual manner Congrats to the director and editor of this great piece It is in my Top 10 Must see list
There I was sitting alone in my flat on a Saturday night with the choice of watching CITIZEN X or The Eurovision Song Contest and for the benefit of Americans reading this I ll explain that TESC is an annual event where musicians from countries all over Europe and Asia Minor have a song contest At the end of the contest countries vote to see what the best song was It s a contest that is even less exciting than it sounds and it may not come as a shock when I say that singing and songwriting isn t of the calibre of Lennon and McCartney And I should correct something in the first sentence of this review because the word Choice is misleading because being a music lover I wasn t going to watch TESC under any circumstance br br So I sat down as the credits rolled for CITIZEN X expecting a run of mill serial killer whodunnit but I d be misleading everyone calling it that It s obvious within the first 10 minutes of CITIZEN X whodunnit What the film does is point out the failures of communism A serial killer comrade This is the Soviet Union serial killers can only exist in decadent imperialist capitalist systems This farcical attitude goes far beyond denial there s a scene where an undercover cop sits in a freezing train station keeping an eye out for potential suspects whilst wearing his police jacket because it s the only warm coat he s got And of course all suspects who are members of the communist party are released without interrogation something which will affect the final death toll All this is very well done as we are shown that it s the communist party system that s on trial but about two thirds of the way through CITIZEN X we find ourselves in 1990 as communism is on its last legs and reforms to the police investigation have taken place It s at this point that the film becomes rather uninteresting due to a lack of political subtext and the film descends into an average manhunt film But don t let that put you off CITIZEN X is an intelligent thriller well played by the cast especially Donald Sutherland as a paternal police chief br br Strangely enough a few years ago I read something written by the famous criminologist Colin Wilson in which he said something along the lines that serial killers let themselves get caught so that they will be the center of attention in the media spotlight and I found myself almost sympathising the party chiefs denying there could be a serial killer in the Soviet Union After all media is controlled by the party and anyone who s old enough to have listened to Radio Moscow or read English translations of Pravda will know that the USSR only reported news stories like potato harvests coal production and thank you letters from Afghanistan Cuba etc for Soviet assistance The concept of becoming a serial killer in a communist system is illogical But I guess if a tree falls in a remote Siberian forest it will still make a sound even though no one is around to hear it
Spoilers in as far as I describe characters and their relation to the plot br br This is a quality film The subject matter is at once grim and gripping The dogged determination of Stephen Rea s character Burakov is simply captivating With any due apologies to him his hangdog continually put upon expression serves the character well He is as we in England would say of the Inspector Taggart TV series character bound to be grim because he sees three murders a week Well that s not strictly accurate as Chikatila operated over a number of years br br You get a real sense of the blankwall resistance of the USSR bureaucracy brilliantly portrayed by Joss Ackland who often seems made for this sort of role br br A key character and I write this as the remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers is being shown on BBC1 is the Donald Sutherland character Mikhail Fetisov His quiet support of Burakov is steadfast And it endures through Perestroika and drives the involvement of the FBI for profiling Brilliant br br This is a must see as far as I am concerned
This is a truly remarkable piece of cinematic achievement From the very start I was utterly hooked into the true story when Lt Viktor Burakov Stephan Rea weeps while performing the autopsies on the remains of the children s bodies This then is the compelling story of Andrei Chikatilo wonderfully played by Jeffrey DeMunn The Green Mile In fact he plays it so well and so sympathetically that the viewer almost starts to pity him until we remember what he is The psychiatrist Dr Alexandr Bukhanovsky wonderfully played by Max Von Sydow was utterly believable in every detail and the point he makes when talking about paranoia in the Soviet Union is made all too apparent by the behaviour of the local Communist Commissar Bondarchuk played by Joss Ackland For me though the outstanding performance was from Donald Sutherland proving once again what a superb character actor he really is I was almost in tears when he told Burakov how the FBI had so closely followed and admired his work This film puts Silence of the Lambs into the shade from the atmospheric and bleak Soviet landscape to the superlative performances by everyone involved br br I rate this film 10 10
Citizen X tells the story of The Butcher of Rostov nickname for a heinous and perverse Russian serial killer who claimed 52 lives from 1978 92 The film focuses on the novice detective Rea who doggedly pursued the killer against all odds in the face of an uncooperative bureaucracy in self serving and convenient denial An HBO product for t v the film offers a solid cast good performances spares the audience much of the grisly details but plays out like a docudrama sans the stylistics of similar Hollywood fare An even and straight forward dramatization of a serious and comparatively little known story more interesting than Jack the Ripper B
Here s an oddity a modern day film about a serial killer that has no fight scenes nobody seen dying no car chases and no loud noises and it takes place in Russia There are only two short action scenes but they are horrific br br The rest of the story is detective work and how much red tape the poor detective had to go through to solve the murders This is a very somber movie and somber best describes the personality of the hero Stephen Rea as well Yet the story is not depressing and it s very interesting all the way through br br Rea is outstanding as the determined harried looked detective Jeffrey DeMunn is downright scary as the killer Donald Sutherland s Russian accent is suspect but he plays the only character in this film that has some warmth br br Once again the story is dotted with liberal agendas here and there with not one but two references to bias against gays the total validity of secular psychology police and government officials being boorish crude bigoted yadda yadda yadda br br Otherwise it s an intelligent and refreshingly low key crime film This is a somewhat unique film that probably is not well known but is well liked by the people who have seen it Since it s based on a true life account of this killer it s all the more chilling Don t pass this by just because you haven t anything about it
There are some excellent comments and observations on this film I was pleased to note the comparisons to Fritz Lang s M forget the 50 s abortive remake with lightweight David Wayne The real villain is not the tortured murderer extraordinarily fine performance by Jeffery DeMunn taking out his sexually frustrated anger on his victims mostly children He is the objective The real villain is the stifling bureaucratic Soviet system drowning in its own corrupted incompetence The frustration of an uncompromisingly dedicated man Rea in his best role since The Crying Game a facile pragmatist who s willing to use the system to his advantage Sutherland always successful in this kind of role a hesitant frightened but determined psychiatrist the incomparable Max Sydow the bumbling boopous bureaucrat of a prosecutor brilliant Brit actor John Wood and the quiet supporting wife of the driven investigator delightful supporter Imelda Staunton This is one damn fine film Its darkness and bleakness are supported by the portrayal of a corrupt incompetent system which works against success The is no need to dip into gore laden slice n dice sensationalism that has characterized so many recent films Gore is present it s a ghastly story but it adds to the depicting of a pathologically twisted human being The success of the story is precisely that these were acts perpetrated by a person a human like you or I Where you and I choose to vent our frustration by reasonable means Chikatilo took his anger out on the most innocent and vulnerable of us our children The superb premise of this story is made manifest by an equally superb cast of excellent actors sadly I note that our Australian friend didn t like the speech and no doubt would have preferred to hear them speaking in Aussie dialect Well too bad This fine film sure worked for me and everyone else I ve talked with who has seen it
This movie tells an amazing story with history and compassion From the careful descriptions of the crime scenes to the mental health of the lead investigator you ll be entranced It s an absolute must see for anyone interested in criminology Interpol relations and how the agencies work together are also great Not overly done either I recommend it for anyone interested in Russian history too How the police work with the political party being what it was It is truly fascinating and frustrating The settings are beautiful It s been a while since I saw this movie the first time It doesn t diminish it s impact Not overly dramatic or graphic it leaves enough to the imagination well you ll see
This has to be one the best movies about serial killers that I ve ever seen and this is coming from someone who absolutely loved Silence of the Lambs HBO has hit the jackpot here This film is compelling from the first moment until the last br br This film has so many underlying themes its hard to tell exactly what it is about It chronicles the decade long search for the Russian serial killer Andrea Chikatilo Stephen Rea gives a brilliantly reserved performance as the inexperienced forensic expert who is put in charge of the investigation and Donald Sutherland gives an even more involving performance as his cynical superior and the only person in the Russian government willing to help him Both of their performances are subtle masterpieces Rea begins naive and unwilling to compromise while Sutherland begins detached and almost amused by the situation Towards the end Rea becomes more world weary and beaten by the system while Sutherland finds himself more passionate and idealistic br br In any other movie I would have said that Sutherland s performance stands out above the rest but here even it is rivaled by Jeffrey DuMann as the serial killer himself DuMann brilliantly creates a character here who inspires empathy rather than the hatred we think we would find he is a monster but he doesn t want to be and we get the idea that he is just as disgusted with what he does as we are He is tortured ashamed but vicious as well br br If you can take the incredibly dark subject matter and it is very disturbing then you should see this movie
Citizen X tells the story of Andrei Chikatilo The Ripper of Rostov who killed 52 people in 8 years time mainly women and children It shows how the investigation was obstructed by Soviet bureaucracy how hard it was to investigate the crimes It does the job in such a brilliant way that it will leave no one untouched In the beginning it s perhaps a little bit slow of pace but it really grabs you as the story unfolds I can only say that next to The Silence of the Lambs this is by far the best movie about a serial killer I ve ever seen br br It is very hard to say which actor s performance stands out above the rest in this movie Stephen Rea is really brilliant as the inexperienced forensic expert who is put in charge of the investigation Donald Sutherland s performance as his cynical superior and the only person in the Russian government willing to help him is as outstanding as Rea s And what to say about Jeffrey DuMann playing the serial killer DuMann brilliantly created a character who inspires empathy rather than hatred Yes he is a monster but he is also a sad figure oppressed and ridiculed by his wife his boss his co workers He is tortured ashamed as well as extremely vicious br br I can only recommend this movie to everybody who s interested in a well made docu drama where the actors are still more important than the special effects It deserves at least a 9 10 perhaps even more if you ask me
I remember following the case of Andre Chicatillo in the newspapers while I was living in South Africa They had photos of him sitting in his cage while being prosecuted in court Not as it turned out to protect the court members but to protect him from the public This was fascinating albeit morbid reading I later heard that a film had been made by HBO about the case but it was made for American TV Bummed Strangely CITIZEN X got a limited cinematic release in South Africa I charged down to the local Ster Kinekor complex and duly bought a ticket I was alone my girlfriend at the time was only interested in the likes of STEEL MAGNOLIAS and FRIED GREEN TOMATOES Wow What a brilliant film Why wasn t it released to a wider audience Had it not been made for TV it could have got an Oscar nomination or 2 There is no way to spoil the ending who the killer is is never kept from the audience Jeffrey DeMunn portrays a truly terrifying psycho He is calm downtrodden considered a failure by his wife and subjected to constant ridicule and humiliation by his superiors at work By committing these horrendous acts he gets to feel strong powerful br br Fighting to catch him against all odds is a pathologist played to excellent turn by Stephen Rea in one of his strongest performances He must battle the snail pace of Russian bureaucracy the primitive resources he has at his disposal and above all the refusal by his superiors to acknowledge that the USSR even has a serial killer The general in charge Joss Ackland says that serial killers are a decadent Western phenomenon Only Donald Sutherland is willing to help but his help must be under the counter The ever brilliant Max Von Sydow plays a Russian psychiatrist who breaks protocol and decides to help the investigators in their quest It is the first time in Russian history that a shrink is used to build a profile of a serial killer still on the loose and he has everything to lose if his involvement is made public br br CITIZEN X is brilliantly acted well written and the music and editing only add to the tension and theme of the film Excellent support from a horribly underused Imelda Staunton and a real sense of impending doom make CITIZEN X a film worth seeing This was too good to be made for TV
Blood Castle aka Scream of the Demon Lover Altar of Blood Ivanna the best but least exploitation cinema sounding title and so on is a very traditional Gothic Romance film That means that it has big creepy castles a headstrong young woman a mysterious older man hints of horror and the supernatural and romance elements in the contemporary sense of that genre term It also means that it is very deliberately paced and that the film will work best for horror mavens who are big fans of understatement If you love films like Robert Wise s The Haunting 1963 but you also have a taste for late 1960s early 1970s Spanish and Italian horror you may love Blood Castle as well br br Baron Janos Dalmar Carlos Quiney lives in a large castle on the outskirts of a traditional unspecified European village The locals fear him because legend has it that whenever he beds a woman she soon after ends up dead the consensus is that he sets his ferocious dogs on them This is quite a problem because the Baron has a very healthy appetite for women At the beginning of the film yet another woman has turned up dead and mutilated br br Meanwhile Dr Ivanna Rakowsky Erna Sch√ºrer has appeared in the center of the village asking to be taken to Baron Dalmar s castle She s an out of towner who has been hired by the Baron for her expertise in chemistry Of course no one wants to go near the castle Finally Ivanna finds a shady individual who becomes even shadier to take her Once there an odd woman who lives in the castle Olga Cristiana Galloni rejects Ivanna and says that she shouldn t be there since she s a woman Baron Dalmar vacillates over whether she should stay She ends up staying but somewhat reluctantly The Baron has hired her to try to reverse the effects of severe burns which the Baron s brother Igor is suffering from br br Unfortunately the Baron s brother appears to be just a lump of decomposing flesh in a vat of bizarre blackish liquid And furthermore Ivanna is having bizarre hallucinatory dreams Just what is going on at the castle Is the Baron responsible for the crimes Is he insane br br I wanted to like Blood Castle more than I did As I mentioned the film is very deliberate in its pacing and most of it is very understated I can go either way on material like that I don t care for The Haunting yes I m in a very small minority there but I m a big fan of 1960s and 1970s European horror One of my favorite directors is Mario Bava I also love Dario Argento s work from that period But occasionally Blood Castle moved a bit too slow for me at times There are large chunks that amount to scenes of not very exciting talking alternated with scenes of Ivanna slowly walking the corridors of the castle br br But the atmosphere of the film is decent Director Jos√© Luis Merino managed more than passable sets and locations and they re shot fairly well by Emanuele Di Cola However Blood Castle feels relatively low budget and this is a Roger Corman produced film after all which usually means a low budget though often surprisingly high quality quickie So while there is a hint of the lushness of Bava s colors and complex set decoration everything is much more minimalist Of course it doesn t help that the Retromedia print I watched looks like a 30 year old photograph that s been left out in the sun too long It appears washed out with compromised contrast br br Still Merino and Di Cola occasionally set up fantastic visuals For example a scene of Ivanna walking in a darkened hallway that s shot from an exaggerated angle and where an important plot element is revealed through shadows on a wall only There are also a couple Ingmar Bergmanesque shots where actors are exquisitely blocked to imply complex relationships besides just being visually attractive and pulling your eye deep into the frame br br The performances are fairly good and the women especially Sch√ºrer are very attractive Merino exploits this fact by incorporating a decent amount of nudity Sch√ºrer went on to do a number of films that were as much soft corn porn as they were other genres with English titles such as Sex Life in a Woman s Prison 1974 Naked and Lustful 1974 Strip Nude for Your Killer 1975 and Erotic Exploits of a Sexy Seducer 1977 Blood Castle is much tamer but in addition to the nudity there are still mild scenes suggesting rape and bondage and of course the scenes mixing sex and death br br The primary attraction here though is probably the story which is much a slow burning romance as anything else The horror elements the mystery elements and a somewhat unexpected twist near the end are bonuses but in the end Blood Castle is a love story about a couple overcoming various difficulties and antagonisms often with physical threats or harms to be together
Although the word megalmania is used a lot to describe Gene Kelly and sometimes his dancing is way too stiff you have to admit the guy knows how to put on a show In American In Paris he choreographs some outstanding numbers some which stall the plot but are nonetheless amazing to look at Check out Gene Kelly s Getting Out Of Bed Routine for starters br br Gene Kelly stars as a GI who is based out of Paris he stayed there to paint soon he is a rich woman s gigolo but he really LOVES SOMEONE ELSE Hoary story sure but the musical numbers save the show here I really loved Georges Gu tary s voice work in this one His Stairway to Paradise and his duet with Le Gene on S Wonderful is s marvelous Oscar Levant and Leslie Caron I can take or leave All in all a pretty good but not dynamite movie
The best part of An American In Paris is the lengthy ballet sequence at the end where Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron are the living personification of several major painters Kelly has earlier been established as a pavement artist in Paris so the sequence is the logical ending to a musical bursting with life and energy Gershwin tunes and cast members like Georges Guetary and Oscar Levant Kelly was at his best here it s a little different to Singin in the Rain and the effect of all the film as one topped with the ballet gives it a definite wow factor No wonder the sequence ended That s Entertainment after all other MGM musical highlights had gone by
What makes for Best Picture material The Oscars have come in for a lot of stick for rewarding overblown spectacles that have aged poorly and ignoring the auteurs who would be deified in decades to come It wasn t because Hollywood was against art or creativity The Academy Awards are the selections made by the industry itself and that is why at least in the classic era they tended to reward the greatest collaborations the most sensational meetings of creative minds br br The Arthur Freed unit at MGM had been bound for Oscar winning glory for several years by this point it was only a matter of time before Freed aided by his strongest director Vincente Minnelli and some the finest musical stars in the business would land a Best Picture Freed had arguably done more to raise the status of the musical than anyone else crafting pictures which wove story and song together without losing the dynamic spectacle of the 30s musicals The point about Freed musicals is that the lyrics of the songs unlike those of Hammerstein or Lerner don t have to tell or even relate to the stories What s important is that the tone of the song and the way it is presented fit into the structure of the film br br An American in Paris was the first of three Freed musicals the other two being Singin in the Rain and The Band Wagon which took existing classic numbers out of their original context and made them work in a completely unrelated story The words don t fit the plot but the routines fit the show So when Gene Kelly sings I Got Rhythm he hasn t even got a girl yet but the way it s done with the French kids joining in is a great bit of characterisation and the upbeat tune and dance gives the movie the little lift it needs at this point An American in Paris also uses the rule breaking allowed in the genre to add little unconventional flights of fancy to tell the story such as the series of dances which accompany the description of Leslie Caron s character br br And what better director for this project than Minnelli himself a painter and a pianist At this time there wasn t really anyone who had a better feel for Technicolor While some directors would saturate each scene in one colour or fill the screen with clashing shades Minnelli s colour schemes are tightly controlled but never look forced In the opening scenes the tones are fairly muted but not drab and in particular there is an absence of red During Oscar Levant and Georges Guetary s meeting in the caf√© a few more vibrant shades are introduced Then during the first musical number By Strauss Minnelli gradually brings in splashes of red a table cloth a bunch of roses until it eventually dominates as if the song has awoken the picture s colour scheme For most of the songs the colours are choreographed as intricately as the people However in some numbers such as Tra la la he keeps the shades the same and instead opens out the space as the song swells up and the characters become more animated br br The Achilles heel of An American in Paris is its story I personally find the romantic angle particularly unpalatable playing as it does like a last hurrah for the misogynistic love stories that reigned supreme in the 30s the headstrong independent woman gets rejected while the meek delicate girl is harassed into loving the hero Even if you don t mind that it is difficult to connect emotionally with the story because it is constantly overshadowed by the songs and dances Compare this to Singin in the Rain which doesn t really have as many great routines or memorable set pieces as An American in Paris but it has a winning storyline Singin in the Rain was overlooked at the 1952 Oscars yet it is regarded as a classic of the genre today But I think people sometimes forget that cinema is an all encompassing form of visual entertainment not just a means of telling a story An American in Paris is not deep or engaging or tear jerking but like a certain DeMille picture that won the top award the following year it certainly is a great show
This is a fine musical with a timeless score by one of my favorite composers Gershwin and a nice Parisien atmosphere which gives the movie a lot of charm but in terms of a story well it s not really there Or at least not very well worked out The acting is also not so smooth by Caron But I liked some of the dialogues I liked the scene at the Seine I liked the character played by Levant the colors and the dancing of course which is quite magnificent br br A 7 5 8 seems on the dot to me
The dazzling seventeen minute dance sequence of George Gershwin s 1928 orchestral piece An American in Paris is an indisputable masterwork Choreographed with precision and unparalleled flair by Gene Kelly the vibrant combination of color music and dance is still eye poppingly startling as the piece is broken down into scenes inspired by selected master artists Dufy in the opening Place de la Concorde piece Manet in the flower market Utrillo in a Paris street Rousseau at the fair Vincent Van Gogh in the spectacular Place de l Opera piece and Toulouse Lautrec for the Moulin Rouge where Kelly wears his famous white bodysuit The 97 minutes that precede this finale are not as exciting not by a long shot but there are certain charms to be had in viewing the entire 1951 Oscar winning musical br br Director Vincente Minnelli and screenwriter Alan Jay Lerner have fashioned a surprisingly sophisticated if rather slight romantic story focused on Jerry Mulligan a former G I who has remained in Paris after the end of WWII trying to make a living as a painter With his braggadocio manner and athletic dancing style Gene Kelly can be concurrently ingratiating and irritating as a screen personality but he seems to find his oeuvre as the carefree Jerry The love triangle plot is focused on Jerry s involvement with Milo Roberts a self proclaimed art patron but a sexual predator when it comes to young artists On their first date in a crowded Montmartre nightclub Jerry unapologetically falls for Lise a young woman who turns out to be the fianc√©e of Henri a professional entertainer and friend of Jerry s pal Adam an out of work concert pianist Romantic complications ensue until the inevitable ending but not before several classic Gershwin songs are performed br br The best of these is the most imitated a swooningly romantic song and dance to Our Love Is Here to Stay along a faux Seine River in a blue hazy mist with yellow fog lights The way Kelly and Leslie Caron circle each other is transcendent as they approach each other tentatively at first and then synchronize beautifully to the music leading to the final clinch Few films have so elegantly and succinctly shown two people falling in love I Got Rhythm and S Wonderful spotlight Kelly s nimble tap dancing and agreeable singing while Embraceable You is danced impressively by Caron in a five scene montage of Henri s all over the map description of Lise to Adam Designed to show off Caron s dancing versatility the sequence is similar to the one in On the Town where Vera Ellen showed off her considerable dancing skills when Kelly s sailor character described his multi faceted vision of Miss Turnstiles br br As Lise the nineteen year old Caron in her first film dances superbly throughout and handles her role with unformed charm with her acting talent not to bloom for several years Looking quite glamorous Nina Foch plays older as the manipulative Milo and manages to be likable enough for us to care about her fate while Oscar Levant is just his sardonic self as Adam Performing an elegant I ll Build a Stairway to Paradise George Gu√©tary plays Henri so agreeably that you feel bad that he does lose the girl at the end This is not the best all around MGM musical but there is certainly enough movie magic to make this quite worthwhile The 2000 DVD contains a fairly pristine print but little else in terms of extras
This is your typical cheerful and colorful MGM musical from the early 50 s and it s definitely on of the better ones to watch out there br br The movie got directed by the genre expert Vincente Minnelli and stars Gene Kelly in the main lead Both did quite a few movies together back in those days of which this one is probably their best known one br br The movie itself actually managed to win the best picture Oscar over the year which meant it beat out movies such as A Place in the Sun A Streetcar Named Desire The African Queen Quo Vadis The Blue Veil Death of a Salesman that year A real accomplishment of course but at the same time also a bit too much credit for this delightful bright and entertaining movie br br When you watch this movie you surely will be entertained by it all which is also thanks to the movie its beautiful color look and the many nice characters within this movie The musical numbers are also all nicely done which is no big surprise when you have people such as Vincente Minnelli and Gene Kelly at work br br But really couldn t had everything that got told in this movie been done in halve an hour less or so I mean we already know where the movie is heading to but yet it manages to stretch it out all for as long as possible Not that it makes the movie drag in any parts it just makes it a bit overlong The movie could had also definitely been done with a few less musical numbers in it br br One of the better MGM musicals that is not without its flaws though br br 8 10
An American In Paris is an integrated musical meaning that the songs and dances blend perfectly with the story The film was inspired by the 1928 orchestral composition by George Gershwin br br The story of the film is interspersed with show stopping dance numbers choreographed by Gene Kelly and set to popular Gershwin tunes Songs and music include I Got Rhythm S Wonderful and Our Love is Here to Stay It set a new standard for the subgenre known as the songbook musical with dozens of Gershwin tunes buried in the underscore The climax is The American in Paris ballet an 18 minute dance featuring Kelly and Caron set to Gershwin s An American in Paris featuring an Impressionistic period daydream in the style of various painters is one of the longest uninterrupted dance sequences of any Hollywood film The ballet alone cost more than half a million dollars a staggering sum at the time br br It s funny to think of such a work of art being born over a pool game between film producer Arthur Freed SINGIN IN THE RAIN WIZARD OF OZ ON THE TOWN MEET ME IN ST LOUIS and THE BAND WAGON and Ira Gershwin It was Freed s idea to buy the title so he could use if in a film about Paris and Gershwin s idea that it would only use Gershwin music br br Original cast was to have Cyd Charisse but she discovered she was pregnant before shooting began A major reason Gene Kelly suggested Leslie Caron as the female lead was because he felt this movie needed a real French girl playing Lise not just an American actress playing one Gene Kelly discovered Leslie Caron while vacationing in Paris where he saw her perform in a ballet When she got the call to audition she said Who s Gene Kelly According to Leslie Caron her introductory dance sequence which included a seductive dance with a chair was considered too suggestive by some censors Gene Kelly directed the brief fantasy dance sequences shown as Lise is introduced br br Vincente Minnelli first wanted Maurice Chevalier in the Georges Gu√©tary part and Celeste Holm in the Nina Foch part br br Minnelli was a groundbreaking director of musicals with Meet Me in St Louis 1944 An American in Paris and The Band Wagon 1953 He used color and songs in ways they hadn t been used before He used space and time imaginatively Best of all though he allowed himself to cut loose for the long ballet sequences that end all his movies The ballet in An American in Paris may be his best work br br Even though Vincente Minnelli is credited as the sole director he was sometimes tied up with his divorce from Judy Garland and other directing projects leaving Gene Kelly to take over the directing duties br br Other highlights include Guetary s rendition of Stairway to Paradise Oscar Levant s fantasy of conducting and performing Gershwin s Concerto in F see why it was Oscar Levant s favorite br br The ballet sequence now that we know it was successful everybody now wants to take credit for it Freed Minnelli Kelly but before the film was completed the New York office of MGM said no to spending a half million dollars on a ballet So Freed went to studio head Louis B Mayer himself and got him to agree New York said no Finally Gene Kelly showed the New York office how a British film THE RED SHOES used a long ballet sequence and that film became a world wide hit and is still considered today the premium example of a successful art film Well the financial guys finally gave in and signed the checks br br There was a break in production after 1 November 1950 at which point Gene Kelly began rehearsing the ballet choreography By the time production for that final sequence resumed on 6 December Vincente Minnelli had finished directing another film Father s Little Dividend 1951 br br Irene Sharaff designed a style for each of the ballet sequence sets reflecting various French impressionist painters Raoul Dufy the Place de la Concorde Edouard Manet the flower market Maurice Utrillo a Paris street Henri Rousseau the fair Vincent Van Gogh the Place de l Opera and Henri de Toulouse Lautrec the Moulin Rouge The backgrounds took six weeks to build with 30 painters working nonstop br br Roger Ebert said after viewing the recent restoration An American in Paris has many qualities not least its famous ballet production number with Kelly and Leslie Caron symbolizing the entire story of their courtship in dance An American In Paris is often compared to SINGIN IN THE RAIN as to which it the greatest musical ever made and one critic put it best when he said SINGIN IN THE RAIN makes me happy and An American In Paris makes me feel good The ballet represents Kelly s fantasies as depicted by the great French artists Renoir Rousseau Lautrec Dufy he admires Arranging a screening for the then ailing Raoul Dufy the actor and producer ducked out until the end credits There relieved they found the artist moved to tears requesting a second helping of the sumptuous finale br br The film was also the first to win a Golden Globe award for Best Motion Picture comedy or musical br br Gene Kelly received an honorary Academy Award that year for his versatility as an actor singer director and dancer and specifically for his brilliant achievements in the art of choreography on film It was his only Oscar
An American in Paris is a wonderful musical about an American painter living in Paris for inspiration He meets a rich woman who admires his paintings on the street and she believes she can get his work to be even more popular to the public e g in a museum Golden Globe nominated Gene Kelly as the artist Jerry Mulligan is just perfect at both singing and especially dancing He also meets the main girl Lise Bouvier Leslie Caron who is engaged to his best friend He can t help his feelings for this girl even after he finds out who she is engaged to Filled with nice romance and wonderful song and dance this is a very good musical film It may drag slightly with his dancing dream sequence i e The American in Paris ballet but there is a good happy ending It won the Oscars for Best Art Direction Set Decoration Best Cinematography Best Costume Design Best Music Scoring of a Musical Picture Best Writing Story and Screenplay and Best Picture and it was nominated for Best Director for Vincente Minnelli and Best Film Editing it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source and it won the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture Musical Comedy and it was nominated for Best Director for Vincente Millenni Liza s father Gene Kelly was number 66 on The 100 Movie Stars and he was number 15 on 100 Years 100 Stars Men I Got Rhythm was number 32 on 100 Years 100 Songs the film was number 9 on 100 Years of Musicals it was number 39 on 100 Years 100 Passions it was number 68 on 100 Years 100 Movies and it was number 58 on The 100 Greatest Musicals Very good
If I remember Ira Gershwin the lyricist and brother of George offered the Gershwin catalog for this film and it was snapped up by the producers In many respects it was a typical 50 s movie musical by the Freed Unit at MGM and directed by Vincente Minelli with a lot of help from Gene Kelly br br The Gershwins were of course among the greatest of all Broadway musical teams but in my opinion George himself was among the greatest of all American composers period Gene Kelly was of course one of the two greatest male dancers of the movie musical One guess as to the other and I don t imagine his casting was ever in doubt But I think the rest of the cast needs some explanation Oscar Levant was a noted personality in his time and as an actual friend of George Gershwin he had to be in this film He was a talented pianist and even a moderately talented composer as well as a noted neurotic and hypochondriac and here as always he plays himself br br Leslie Caron was an unknown at this time and she was of the French gamin type A talented dancer she was never a real beauty George Gu√©tary who plays the part of Maurice Chavalier oops I mean Henri Baurel was Greek and not French but he certainly is more than OK as a French boulevardier even if a little too young for the part br br Gene s hoofer s voice is serviceable here but Gu√©tary has much the better vocal equipment Though Gene was better cast elsewhere as obviously in Singin in the Rain where his character is much more calculating even here he shows himself to be something of a heel at times He was not for nothing cast as the original heel Joey in Pal Joey the Broadway musical I was not so enchanted with his I Got Rhythm scene with the children which does not appear as spontaneous as was intended in my opinion br br I also found Nina Foch s character Milo to be rather irritating br br But the highlight of the film is obviously the lengthy ballet at the end of the film based on the title music with sets and costumes in the styles of the great French Impressionist painters br br I found it difficult to believe Gene and Oscar as struggling artists and I don t think the musical numbers are as well set up as they might be but on balance the Gershwin music is very well served in this film br br The DVD is well done with fine clear graphics when they are supposed to be and the mono sound is good but a trifle shallow
Oxford Mississippi at least Okay the Paris we get is Paris Culver City apart from the Establishing library footage of the real McCoy but it IS Paris in spirit than which nothing nowhere is better Okay Kelly is no Astaire but then who is and Caron is no Hepburn ditto but Alan Lerner is light years ahead of the vastly overrated Comden and Green who scripted Kelly s other big 50s musical Singin In The Rain a curious replication of lyricists writing screenplays featuring songs by OTHER lyricists and just to balance things the Gershwin numbers are far superior to the Arthur Freed Nacio Herb Brown numbers so Alan Lerner didn t have to feel too outclassed The story needn t detain us any more than the anomalies Kelly hasn t got change of a match and is a painter i e bohemian yet he is able to scare up a perfectly good suit at a few hours notice when Foch invites him to dinner at her hotel in the well documented Love Is Here To Stay sequence the lovers are strangely unmolested by passers by other lovers and the bridge in the background is totally free of both pedestrian and vehicular traffic this is after all a feelgood musical so it stands or falls by the score and in this case it stands four square As feel good musicals go it s definitely in the top 10
The story and music George Gershwin are wonderful as are Levant Guetary Foch and of course Kelly One thing s missing and that thing is a good leading lady I m sorry Leslie Caron bothers me Anyway despite her the plot moves along nicely with the famous and deservedly so Ballet Oh the colours the dazzling reds blues greens and yellows Musn t forget the beiges as well I just adore the contrast between the Beaux Arts Ball completely black and white costumes and the ever so brilliant Ballet br br So I suppose what I m trying to say is this Please by all means see it and enjoy it because though it isn t the best it is MARVELOUS But be sure not to forget that other Gene Kelly musical with the 20 year old girl that was catapulted to stardom just afterward
An American in Paris is a showcase of Gene Kelly Watch as Gene sings acts and dances his way through Paris in any number of situations Some purely majestic others pure corn One can imagine just what Kelly was made of as he made this film only a year before Singin In The Rain He is definately one of the all time greats It is interesting to look at the parallels between the two films especially in Kelly s characters the only main difference being that one is based in Paris the other in L A br br Some have said that Leslie Caron s acting was less than pure Perhaps Cyd Charisse who was originally intended for the role could have done better however Caron is quite believable in the role and has chemistry with Kelly Oscar Levant s short role in this film gave it just what it needed someone who doesn t look like Gene Kelly Filling the role as the everyman isn t an easy task yet Levant did it with as much class as any other lead br br The song and dance routines are all perfection Even the overlong ballet at the end of the film makes it a better film with it than without Seeing that there really wasn t much screen time to make such a loving relationship believable Minnelli used this sequence to make it seem as if you d spent four hours with them Ingenious br br I would have to rate this film up with Singin since it is very similar in story and song Singin would barely get the nod because of Debbie Reynolds uplifting performance br br Full recommendation br br 8 10 stars
Paris is the place to be to enjoy beautiful art and music and to fall madly in love as is the case in this film Boy meets girl they fall in love but something stands in their way of eternal happiness the classic story br br The wonderful music of George Gerschwin complements the great dancing by Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron An American in Paris is a humorous light hearted loving film well worth watching br br 8 10 br br
Uggh I really wasn t that impressed by this film though I must admit that it is technically well made It does get a 7 for very high production values but as for entertainment values it is rather poor In fact I consider this one of the most overrated films of the 50s It won the Oscar for Best Picture but the film is just boring at times with so much dancing and dancing and dancing That s because unlike some musicals that have a reasonable number of songs along with a strong story and acting such as MEET ME IN ST LOUIS this movie is almost all singing and dancing In fact this film has about the longest song and dance number in history and if you aren t into this the film will quickly bore you Give me more story As a result with overblown production numbers and a weak story this film is like a steady diet of meringue it just doesn t satisfy in the long run br br To think this is the film that beat out A Streetcar Named Desire and A Place in the Sun for Best Picture And to make matters worse The African Queen and Ace in the Hole weren t even nominated in this category Even more amazing to me is that Ace in the Hole lost for Best Writing Screenplay to this film even though An American in Paris had hardly any story to speak of and was mostly driven by dance and song
While the story is sweet and the dancing and singing in the main part of the film are a joy the uniqueness of the film and what makes it a masterpiece is the dream sequence It features the combination of the highest form of truly American music Gershwin the engaging beauty of French impressionistic art Kelly s enthralling choreography including his rapturous pas de deux d amour really a separate genre with the most magnificent palette of color ever devised for the set Matching the surging music and the visual explosion with those dances was a true work of a creative genius and a great artist
I dug out from my garage some old musicals and this is another one of my favorites It was written by Jay Alan Lerner and directed by Vincent Minelli It won two Academy Awards for Best Picture of 1951 and Best Screenplay The story of an American painter in Paris who tries to make it big Nina Foch is a sophisticated lady of means and is very interested in helping him but soon finds she loves the guy Meanwhile Gene Kelly falls for lovely damsel Leslie Caron His main dancing partner and I must say they are fantastic together on the floor and otherwise Famous French singer Georges Guietary sings too So if you like good smooth dancing and fun filled scenes filled with Oscar Levant s nimble piano fingers the songs of George Gershwyn will live on forever in this colorful gem 8 10
Released two years before I was born this Oscar winning movie has it all lavish Technicolor sets and costumes breathtaking cinematography superb wall to wall Gershwin music superior choreography a lighter than air screenplay and great performances by Kelly Levant Foch Guetary and Caron Hollywood doesn t make em like this anymore Definitely this is my favorite movie of all time a standard by which I judge all other films ENJOY ENJOY ENJOY
Timeless musical gem with Gene Kelly in top form stylish direction by Vincente Minnelli and wonderful musical numbers It is great entertainment from start to finish one of those films that people watch with a smile and say they don t make em like they used to But they never did quite make them like this The climactic 25 minute musical sequence without any dialogue is among the most beautiful in film history Movie magic clearly derived from the heart and soul of everyone involved A must see
I enjoyed this film It was lighthearted delightful and very colorful You can see that MGM was showing off Technicolor There are hardly any colors that do not appear in this film Every scene is packed full The choreography was great Gene Kelly is a wonder He is so talented The dance numbers in this film are all perfectly executed and perfectly designed He understands that the dances can tell the story as much as anything else The last section of the film the grand dance sequence is very impressive What makes this film very special is Gershwin s music Few American composers have had a better gift for melody I very much enjoy Gershwin s music It is enchanting Ira Gershwin is definitely one of the greatest lyric writers He is so witty and charming This was a highly entertaining film
Okay so the plot is on shaky ground Yeah all right so there are some randomly inserted song and or dance sequences for example Adam s concert and Henri s stage act And Leslie Caron can t really um you know act br br But somehow An American In Paris manages to come through it all as a polished first rate musical largely on the basis of Gene Kelly s incredible dancing talent and choreography and the truckloads of charm he seems to be importing into each scene with Caron He needs to because she seems to have a problem with emoting br br The most accomplished and technically awe inspiring number in this musical is obviously the 16 minute ballet towards the end of the film It s stunningly filmed and Kelly and Caron dance beautifully But my favourite number would have to be Kelly s character singing I Got Rhythm with a bunch of French school children then breaking into an array of American dances It just goes to prove how you don t need special effects when you ve got some real talent br br Not on the classics level with Singin In The Rain but pretty high up there nonetheless Worth the watch
I felt it necessary to respond to the comments posted on the front page of this film s page because some of it was slightly misinformative br br Originally I posted quotes from the original poster but I wasn t sure if it was proper given that this is the comments index and not a message board though we used to use em that way back before IMDb added the film message boards so I will edit this to make it unnecessary br br Well first of all you may not be aware of this but Gene Kelly first became famous for playing Pal Joey on Broadway in the original production When Vincente Minnelli decided to make a Gershwin panorama film he wanted Kelly s character to be more sophisticated than the goody two shoes roles he had been playing in most his films with the exception of For Me and My Gal Alan Jay Lerner was instructed to construct a new story set in Paris based on the story of Pal Joey This gave Kelly a chance to play his famous role from Broadway even though Warners had outbid MGM for the rights to Pal Joey In my opinion the WB film Pal Joey is a wreck though Sinatra was suitable for the role but other problems sunk the film script changes and poor direction br br You complain that Kelly s pictures are not well done even citing your art education to prove the point But you miss the fact that Kelly s bad art was clearly designed to be bad and it is necessary for the story characters The pictures are so bad the audience knows that Kelly isn t ready for an exhibition Even he knows it though Milo has sort of sugared him up to the point where he almost believes her But it s important that the audience not be sitting there saying but he s a great artist if he only had the chance You want the audience to be fully aware of his deficiencies br br Then you complain that he sabotages his interest in the show again you are not understanding the structure of the story He refuses because he doesn t want to feel like a gigolo and because he knows he s not really ready for the exhibition His enthusiasm for the exhibition is certainly not as great as Joey s enthusiasm to start a nightclub But it serves the same function in the plot Remember it s essential in Pal Joey the play that Joey gives up his nightclub after he realizes that he doesn t deserve it Same with the art show If Kelly s paintings were actually good it would undermine this whole point br br Then you complain that Caron and Kelly have no chemistry I guess it s in the eye of the beholder I agree the chemistry between them is not as strong as it should be but for me it was fine Compare it to even worse forced romances like the one between Cary Grant and Sophia Loren in The Pride and the Passion br br When you say that the big dance finale has nothing to do with anything else in this film it just shows that you haven t dug beneath the surface of the film into its symbolism Many elements in the dance sequence relate to the story and characters and through the dance the plot is resolved through images and symbolism It s about finding love enjoying love then losing love he looks around and his love is gone The movements of the symphony are constructed so that part of each dance scene mirrors a separate phase of Parisian Art and also a separate phase of their relationships If you didn t see that it s not the movie s fault It s certainly not a load of crap
An American in Paris was in many ways the ultimate mixture of art and Hollywood musical Made at the height of MGM s powers as a musical powerhouse the film features memorable music from the Gershwins who rightly have been called the 20th Century s equivalent of Beethoven and Mozart br br Gene Kelly was also at the height of his powers in this film though it could be rightly argued that this movie was just the warm up for his best work in Singin in the Rain 1952 The two films are actually closely linked Aside from the Arthur Freed connection the Broadway Melody segment in Rain owes its existence to the incredible American in Paris Ballet sequence in this film This might well have been the only time a dance number is specially mentioned in the opening credits of the film And it deserved to be as it showcases Gene Kelly s skills as a dancer and choreographer to their utmost degree br br The film s cast is uniformly excellent Leslie Caron incredibly making her film debut shows a maturity that makes you think she d been making films for years Her introductory dance sequence and later her work on the Ballet provides some surprisingly sexy moments rivalled in MGM Musicals only by Cyd Charisse s work in Singin in the Rain and The Band Wagon Oscar Levant is hilarious as Kelly s stoic pal who gets two of the film s best moments during the end party sequence which I will not give away for anyone who hasn t seen the film and one of the film s most memorable musical numbers which couples his incredible piano skills with state of the art for the time special effects br br Less memorable are Georges Guetary as Kelly s romantic rival though he does get a few musical highlights and Nina Foch as Leslie Caron s romantic rival The May December relationship between Kelly s character and Nina s reminded me of the same kept man relationship seen between George Peppard and Patricia Neal in Breakfast at Tiffany s br br There are a few elements of the film that made it less satisfying for me than Singin in the Rain The Ballet though lavish and well produced doesn t really fit with the rest of the movie Without giving away the plot the Ballet just happens with no real rhyme or reason And unlike the Broadway Melody sequence it really doesn t have anything to do with the plot and in the best musicals the songs always have some sort of raison d etre br br Making matters worse is the ending of the film which happens immediately after the Ballet Although the ending shouldn t be a surprise this IS an MGM musical after all I was hoping for a bit more movie after the Ballet ended It s as if director Vincente Minnelli felt that he couldn t follow the Ballet with anything else The film literally left me in the lurch br br That negative aside An American in Paris rightly ranks alongside the best of Hollywood s musicals It doesn t quite reach the heights of Singin in the Rain but it comes close and it remains a testament to Gene Kelly s skills as one of the greatest dancers of all time
I saw An American in Paris on its first release when I was still at school and fell in love with it straightaway I went back to see it again the next day and have lost count of the number of times I have seen it since both in the cinema and on TV It makes fantastic use of some of the best music and songs by the greatest popular composer of the twentieth century George Gershwin and features the greatest male Gene Kelly and female Leslie Caron dancers in Hollywood history The supporting cast of Oscar Levant as quirky as ever Georges Guetary why didn t he make more movies and Nina Foch brilliant in an unsympathetic role are at the top of their form The closing ballet superbly choreographed to the title music makes excellent use of the sights and sounds of Paris and of the images of impressionist and post impressionist artists All the Gershwin songs are beautifully staged but the most memorable are It s Very Clear Caron and Kelly on the banks of the Seine and I Got Rhythm the kids of Paris joining Gene Kelly in Une Chanson Americaine If you love Paris see this movie If you ve never been to Paris in your life see it But see it
Gene Kelly came up with some really grand ideas for musicals while with MGM Here he s at the top of his creative powers working with the Arthur Freed musical unit Hard to believe when you watch An American In Paris that the players never left the back lot at MGM br br The magic of An American In Paris is due to the creative editing under the direction of Vincent Minnelli and the sets that MGM designed blended with some background establishing shots The idea of the film originated with Kelly who wanted simply to do a film with a lengthy ballet sequence involving George Gershwin s tone poem An American in Paris It sounded good to Arthur Freed who approached Ira Gershwin who said fine with him as long as they used other Gershwin material br br Gershwin got the kind of deal for Gershwin music that Irving Berlin normally got Not one note of non Gershwin music is heard in An American in Paris Listen to some of the background music and you will hear things like Embraceable You and But Not For Me which are not real musical numbers br br Another guy who was a fair hand at writing lyrics Alan Jay Lerner wrote the story which admittedly is a thin one All about an ex GI played by Gene Kelly who after World War II never left France just settled into an apartment on the Left Bank and proceeded to become a starving artist He lives with eccentric composer Oscar Levant and does that ever sound like a redundancy br br Two women are interested in him Another expatriate American played by Nina Foch who wants to sponsor him as a painter if he ll reciprocate in other matters But Kelly falls for a shop girl played by Leslie Caron in her film debut Caron also has musical comedy star Georges Guetary interested in here br br Of course the plot is just an excuse to sing and dance to the music of George Gershwin An American in Paris happens to be the first film I ever saw as an in flight movie on the first airplane trip I ever took I still remember flying back from Phoenix Arizona to Kennedy Airport seeing Gene Kelly doing I ve Got Rhythm My favorite number in the film however is Tra La La which Kelly sings and dances all over the apartment with Oscar Levant playing the piano At one point Kelly dances on top of the baby grand piano br br In a book about Arthur Freed I read a quote where he said in the American in Paris ballet sequence was to be done with the background of the French impressionists which he felt the public would take to rather than a realistic setting on the streets or back lot So it happened that way Kelly had done lengthy ballet sequences in Words and Music The Pirate and On the Town But this one topped them all Still does in my opinion and that includes some of Gene Kelly s later films br br In a surprise upset at the Oscars An American In Paris was chosen best picture for 1951 beating out the heavily favored A Streetcar Named Desire I guess fantasy trumped realism that year Big budgets also have an upper hand in these things as well br br Still An American in Paris is one of the best movie musicals ever done and since the studios no longer have all that creative talent under one roof something less likely to be repeated
Vincente Minnelli directed some of the most celebrated entertainments in cinema history He was among the first Hollywood directors to show that a profound love of color motion and music might produce intelligent entertainment br br American in Paris is the story of an ex GI who remains in France after the war to study and paint He falls in love with a charming gamine Lise Bourvier Their romantic love affair sparkles as brightly as the City of Lights itself The whole movie brings a touch of French elegance where technique artistic style and music all come together in perfect synchronism br br The first musical sequence introduces the exciting personality of Leslie Caron in her screen debut She is like a diamond a touch of class George Guetary describes his fianc√©e ambiguous grace in a montage of different dance styles sweet and shy vivacious and modern graceful and awesome The number leads to an unpretentious bistro where Kelly and his very good friends in Paris share a gentle parody of Viennese waltzes Later Kelly celebrates a popular tap dancing with a crowd of enthusiastic children singing with him I Got Rhythm and at the massive jazz nightclub Kelly spots the girl of his dreams He is instantly hit by her sparkling sapphire blue eyes and only one clear thing is in his mind to pull Lize onto the dance floor and sing to her It s very clear Our love is here to stay br br To the joyful Tra La La Kelly provides humor wit and talent all around Oscar Levant s room and even on the top of his brown piano br br When he meets his pretty Cinderella along the Seine river Kelly is swept away by his happy meeting with Caron He expresses all his emotions with Our Love Is Here to Stay The piece had a definite nighttime feel as the two lovers were bathed in soft blue smoky light They start an enchanting dance duet juxtaposing differing elements Caron dances with her head on his shoulder then tries to run away in a fluid way They move backward away from each other then pause to rush toward each other for a little kiss and a warm hug br br The film s weakest numbers were those that bear little relation to the story In one Georges Guetary performs an entertaining stage show with showgirls in giant ornaments floating down to the stage In another Oscar Levant imagines himself conducting a concert and playing not only a piano recital but the other instruments as well He even applauds to himself as members of the audience br br The extravagant climactic super ballet of the film is quite an adventure a breakthrough in taste direction and design It is a blaze of love fury and vividness It is Kelly s major fantasy of his lost love and of his feeling about Paris as viewed through the huge backdrops of some of France s most Impressionist painters br br The number starts at the Beaux Arts Ball after Kelly finds himself separated from Lise and begins a sketch with a black crayon It gathers the important parts of the film s story through a constantly changing locations all in the style of the painters who have influenced Jerry The tour richly attractive and superbly atmospheric includes the Place De la Concorde Fountain the Madeleine flower market the Place De l Op√©ra to his Rendez Vous at Montmartre with the cancan dancers in a representation of Lautrec s Moulin Rouge br br Kelly seems to defy the boundaries of his physical self Caron seems to dominate her space and sweeps you away to another time and place br br Nina Foch appeared very attractive and elegant in her one shouldered white gown In one of the film s most famous lines Kelly asks her That s quite a dress you almost have on What holds it up Nina cleverly replies modesty br br An American in Paris garnered six Oscars including an honorary award to Gene Kelly The film gave us a wealth of memories to take home
Parsifal 1982 Starring Michael Kutter Armin Jordan Robert Lloyd Martin Sperr Edith Clever Aage Haugland and the voices of Reiner Goldberg Yvonne Minton Wolfgang Schone Director Hans Jurgen Syberberg br br Straight out of the German school of film the kind that favored tons of symbolism and Ingmar Bergmanesque surrealism came this 1982 film of Wagner s final masterpiece Parsifal written to correspond with Good Friday Easter and the consecration of the Bayreuth Opera House This film follows the musical score and plot accurately but the manner in which it was filmed and performed is bold and avant garde and no other Parsifal takes the crown in its bizarre cinematography Syberberg is known for controversial films Prior to this film he had released films about Hitler and Nazism Richard Wagner and his personal Anti Semitism and a documentary about Winifred Wagner one of his grand daughters This film is possibly disturbing in many aspects Parsifal sung by Reiner Goldberg but acted by Michael Kutter is a male throughout the first part of the film and then after the enchantment of Kundry s kiss is transformed into a female This gender bending element displays the feminine masculine ying yang nature of the quest for the Holy Grail which serves all mankind and redeems it through Christ s blood In the pagan sorcerer Klingsor s fortress there are photographs of such notoriously sinister figures as Hitler Nietzche Cosima Wagner and Wagner s mistress Matilde Wesendock The Swaztika flag hangs outside the fortress Parsifal journeys into the 19th and 20th century throughout the film The tempting Flower Maidens are in the nude Kundry is portrayed as a sort of beautiful but corrupt Mary Magdalene or Eve from Genesis played by Edith Clever but beautifully sung by mezzo soprano Yvonne Minton Ultimately this film is for fans of this type of bizarre Germanic European symbolic metafiction and for intellectuals who appreciate the symbolism the history and lovers of Wagner opera Indeed the singing is grand and compelling Reiner Goldberg s Parsifal is a focused and intense voice but it lacks the depth and overall greatness of the greater Parsifals of the stage James King Wolfgang Windgassen Rene Kollo and today s own Placido Domingo Yvone Minton is a sensual voiced dramatic and exciting Kundry delving into her tormented state perfectly While the production is certainly unorthodox and as un Wagnerian as it can possibly get Wagner s concept was Christian ceremonial pomp with Grails spears castles Knights and wounded kings a dark sorcerer darkness turning into light etc typical Wagnerian themes it is still an enjoyable art house film
This very peculiar setting of Wagner s last opera definitely grew on me When I first saw it I was somewhat annoyed by many of the films surrealistic images and felt that far too much was superimposed upon the story However if you can put up with a fair amount of rather recherch√© gimmicks I think you will find that the film DOES manage to capture the very strange other worldly atmosphere of the opera and that there are moments which are particularly fine br br Personally I never really understood the role of Kundry until I saw how Edith Clever portrayed her Her performance a lip synchronized mime of the singing voice of Yvonne Minton is nothing short of dazzling from end to end and alone justifies the hours it takes to absorb the film br br Another reason to delight in this film is that it captures the spectacular interpretation of Robert Lloyd of the crucial role of Gurnemanz one which Lloyd has performed to a crisp at opera houses throughout the world I have been privileged to enjoy him in the role of Gurnemanz on the stage of the Metropolitan Opera several times and the lusciousness of his voice and the warm fatherliness of his interpretation of this noble character really needed to be preserved as did his performance in the character s two major monologues the Karfreitag scene and the recounting of the prophecy in Act 1 br br The version I have seen was a videotape made for America and so there were subtitles which alas could not be done away with This is especially unfortunate because the translation used is very inaccurate and forces an extremely Christian interpretation on a film which is already forcing layers of interpretation on the opera This seemed to me to be quite contrary both to Wagner s clear AVOIDANCE of Christianity and his very deliberate attempt to generalize the Christian elements of the story See footnote with spoiler at the end of this review I find it nearly impossible when viewing a film with subtitles to keep from absorbing them and strongly recommend that if in the DVD versions you have the ability to turn the subtitles off you do so and instead if the opera is unfamiliar to you that you read the libretto carefully beforehand br br The bottom line is that there is much in the film which I dislike and would just as soon have seen done differently but it has risen steadily in my estimation over the years since I first saw it and I find myself drawn to enjoy it again and again br br __________________________________________________________________ br br FOOTNOTE CONTAINING A SPOILER A good example would be Kundry s famous line I saw him him and laughed This gets translated in the subtitles for reasons which escape me as I saw the Savior s face It is especially irritating to me because throughout the libretto Wagner very deliberately and carefully refers to this unseen character WHO NEED NOT BE THE BIBLICAL Jesus as der Heiland i e the German for The Healer a reference to the wound of Amfortas and to all wounds and maladies and the need for healing
updated January 1st 2006 br br Parsifal is one of my two favorite Wagner operas or music dramas to be more accurate Meistersinger is the other though it s hard to imagine it as the top of anyone s pops The libretto by the composer as usual is a muddle of religion paganism eroticism and possibly even homo eroticism and its length may make it seem to the audience like hearing paint dry br br Wagner being a famous anti Semite Klingsor may be one of his surrogate Jewish villains naturally entrusted the premiere to an unconverted not for want of RW s trying Hermann Levi who was his favorite conductor Go figure Kundry a most mixed up gal and another likely Jewish surrogate is both villainous or benevolent depending on the scene br br Considering that many video versions of Parsifal seem on the stodgy side this film of the opera is in comparison a breath of fresh air Hans J√ºrgen Syberberg the director has brought considerable imagination to it but it s hard to know why he made some of his choices For example the notorious dual Parsifals of each gender the puppets the death mask of Wagner set and various dolls and symbols such as the Nazi swastika in one of the traveling scenes If I remember the real Engelbert Humperdinck wrote the actual music to pad out the scene changes Though Wagner himself died much too early to be an actual Nazi many of his descendants As well as his second wife Cosima were at least fellow travelers including their grandson Wolfgang Wagner who still runs the Bayreuth Festival at an advanced age In fact Wolfgang s son Gottfried Wagner in complete opposition to his father has tried to come to terms honestly with his great grandfather br br Syberberg too seems politically ambiguous from what I ve read In 1977 he made a well known film on Hitler Hitler ein Film aus Deutschland Sometimes called Our Hitler in English Since it lasts all of 8 hours and hasn t been widely distributed most people have not seen it including myself br br Armin Jordan the conductor of the audio CD on which this film is based plays Amfortas sung by Wolfgang Sch√∂ne Edith Clever Yvonne Minton plays Kundry Michael Kutter and Karin Krick play the dual Parsifals Both sung by Reiner Goldberg and Robert Lloyd and Aage Haugland both play and sing Gurnemanz and Klingsor br br Though the opera takes place over a long period of time and all except Kundry have been described as having aged considerably between Acts 2 and 3 no one looks a day older by the end of the opera The magic of the Grail In this opera the Grail is the cup from which Jesus drank at the Last Supper and not Mary Magdalene as in more recent times an idea I find preposterous br br The conducting and singing are all quite serviceable and the DVD seems to have improved the sound if not the picture to a great extent Yes I agree that Kna s approach is superior even on the second stereo version but he is probably superior to all recorded versions on the whole br br Not a Parsifal for all Wagnerites but I think it works quite well as a filmed opera
Etienne Girardot is just a character actor the sort of person people almost never would know by name However he once again plays the coroner one of the only actors in the Philo Vance films that played his role more than once I ve already seen him two other times and loved him every time because he was so funny and a breath of fresh air This film also is great to watch because in addition to Girardot there are many other wonderful character actors along for the ride including Grant Mitchell Gene Lockhart Henry Walthal Kent Smith H B Warner and Nat Pendleton This is quite an impressive cast and they sure made the job easier for leading man and woman Edmund Lowe and Virginia Bruce br br These great character actors are one of the big reasons I love these old B movies While the mystery itself is rarely that terrific because of the breezy writing and acting the films really satisfy As for this film Vance is played wonderfully by Lowe but like I said the mystery itself is only an after thought with a silly plot involving hypnosis and suicides Unfortunately you cannot hypnotize anyone to do anything of the sort I have training in clinical hypnosis and if I COULD do anything like the evil guy could do in the film I would have done it Used car salesmen and a few of my old bosses would have been obvious targets br br Overall while not the best Philo Vance film it was very good and it s a darn shame Lowe only played this role once In fact aside from William Powell who played Vance five times the series was hindered by a long long succession of actors such as Basil Rathbone Wilfred Hyde White and Warren William and many others playing Vance This is a similar problem that also plagued the Bulldog Drummond series just too many different actors playing the leading man br br Well worth seeing and exciting though also quite impossible
When Philo Vance Edmund Lowe is standing precariously on the edge of a balcony high above the city apparently hypnotized and just about to step to his death it immediately reminded me of a nearly identical scene in another film made nine years later The Woman in Green in which Sherlock Holmes Basil Rathbone is similarly about to hurl himself into space while being hypnotized br br Happily both Philo Vance and Sherlock Holmes survive these attempts at murder by unscrupulous criminals Exciting cinematic suspense in both these scenes When will they learn you can t cloud the minds of great fictional detectives
EDMUND LOWE who reminds me somewhat of Warren William heads the nice cast of an interesting little mystery that moves at a brisk pace and runs just a little over an hour br br Douglas Walton plays the unlucky jockey who appears to be intent on his own demise hypnotism anyone and the suspects include a good number of the supporting cast everyone from Virginia Bruce Kent Smith Frieda Inescourt Gene Lockhart Jessie Ralph Benita Hume Rosalind Ivan and H B Warner As an added bonus there s Nat Pendleton as a dimwit detective and furthermore get a load of that art deco set decoration for the fancy interiors of a wealthy home Must have been a set that was used in many a subsequent film br br On the plus side the mystery is not so complicated that anyone can follow the plot with reasonable assurance of not being too baffled It s all suddenly clear to detective Philo Vance and then he has a final confrontation with the murderer that gives the film a nifty five minutes of unmitigated suspense br br Nicely done and passes the time in an entertaining manner
S S Van Dine must have been a shrewd businessman in dealing with Hollywood Most of the film series from the studio days were usually confined to one or two studios But apparently Van Dine must have sold his rights to each book about Philo Vance one at a time Note that Paramount MGM Warner Brothers and more all released Philo Vance films Only Tarzan seemed to get around Hollywood more br br MGM produced the Garden Murder Case and starred Edmund Lowe as the fashionable detective Of course MGM had the screen s original Philo under contract at the time but Bill Powell was busy doing The Thin Man at the time and I guess Louis B Mayer decided to concentrate him there br br Edmund Lowe is a pretty acceptable Philo Vance Lowe had started out pretty big at the tail end of the silent era with What Price Glory and then with a string of films with Victor McLaglen with their Flagg and Quirt characters But after McLaglen got his Oscar for The Informer Lowe seemed to fade into the B picture market br br The Garden Murder Case involves three separate victims Douglas Walton Gene Lockhart and Frieda Inescourt The sinister atmosphere around the perpetrator kind of gives it away the mystery is really how all the killings are connected and how they are accomplished br br I will say this though Vance takes a very big chance in exposing the villain and the last 15 minutes are worthy of Hitchcock
Nicely and intelligently played by the two young girls Mischa Barton as Frankie and Ingrid Uribe as Hazel although the plot is rather a stretch of the imagination Young Hazel running for mayor seems out of place to be honest br br While the acting is well done by all concerned the movie tends to lack a genuine atmosphere of drama Perhaps we ve grown to expect gritty reality in movies rather like comparing Pollyanna to How Green Was My Valley Never mind each of them are good in their own way br br I do admire Joan Plowright even if her role is somewhat subdued here Middle of the road entertainment well suited for younger viewers and how nice at times to be exposed to fine classical music which is almost a rarity br br I find this movie to be a welcomed change as it reflects quieter thoughtful values for the growing up years and no violence thank goodness A warm family film to enjoy
I thought that it was a great film for kids ages 6 12 A little sappy but the story is uplifting an fresh It proves that the dreams of an adolescent can truly come true I think that it s a great story for any kid who is feelings down or feels as if there trying to juggle too many things among them Very cute film Bravo
A great storyline with a message Joan Plowright is superb as Phoebe Mike Kopsa is hilarious as coach and Richard de Klerk plays the role of Carmine superbly Mischa Barton as Frankie puts in a good performance and Ingrid as Hazel plays her first lead extremely well This film is superbly directed by Jo Beth Williams The editing is first rate
This is a great movie to see with your girlfriend My friend and I both love dance and ran into this movie at the video store We had to get it With no violence and such a warming story its a great movie to relax to and just enjoy your night I would recommend this movie to any family or just a bunch of girls looking for a cute movie
An excellent family movie gives a lot to think on There s absolutely nothing wrong in this film Everything is just perfect The script is great it s so real such things could happen in everyone s life And don t forget about acting it s just awesome Just look at Frankie and You ll know what I thought about This picture is a real can t miss
This film struck me as a project that had a lot of the right ingredients but somewhere along the way they didn t quite come together I don t know who made it but it has a slightly Disney esque feel While parts of it are improbable like when a pre teen runs for a public office and tend to prevent the story from being taken seriously there is a healthy dose of normalcy whatever that is to keep things balanced and in perspective The acting is alright Strangely the relationship between Frankie and her grandmother is convincing but the relationship between Hazel and Frankie is a bit off It s interesting to see how she has to work hard to keep a balance between her best friend her grandmother and her two passions ballet and baseball Being a baseball player myself it was quite painful to watch Frankie try to hold her own on a team of boys but it does a good job of showing the struggle she faces I read somewhere that she isn t really ballerina but the editing in this film did a very good job of making her dancing look not only natural but beautiful Overall it was a good film about honesty and ambition but its star Mischa Barton didn t quite achieve the level of realism we saw during her performances in Lawn Dogs Lost and Delirious and her small but shocking performance opposite Haley Joel Osment in The 6th Sense
I first saw this film during and International Film Studies course I am a non traditional student and perhaps for reasons of years lived or wisdom accrued appreciated the slow reflective pacing of the film s narrative Languorous with the heat and dust of an arid clime the story is deeply psychological replete with multi layered symbolism and an articulate inversion of the theme of being the Other in a land that one does not understand the understanding that does come is fraught with the unresolved memories and subjectivity of the outsider Made nearly 20 years ago it is also a forerunner in a genre of numerous other international films that explore the themes of colonials in colonized spaces clueless to the nuances of the cultures into which they have entered Much more lavishly filmed and heavily financed works that have been made since reflect the same themes Indochine Nowhere in Africa are two that in comparison perhaps make Chocolat seem pale and boring It has no adrenaline pumping action or extreme violence The struggles are mental emotional and subtle But that being said it is a fine film worth a viewing
Claire Denis debut is both a brave and self assured one In this depiction of life towards the end of French colonialist Cameroon she explores the relationships between men and women black and white br br With the black servant Prot√©e as the film s primary object of desire and oppression the film enters taboo territory from the beginning Denis builds a picture of life through a series of character relationships that keep the informed viewer fixed to the screen The mood of the film is captured perfectly by the camera work and lack of lighting br br A great discourse
This movie is all about subtlety and the difficulty of navigating the ever shifting limits of mores race relations and desire Granted it is not a movie for everyone There are no car chases no buildings exploding no murders The drama lies in the tension suggested by glances minimal gestures spatial boundaries lighting and things left sometimes very ostensibly unsaid It s about identity memory community belonging The different parts of the movie work together to reinforce the leitmotifs of self and other identity desire limits and loss It will reward the attentive and sensitive viewer It will displease those whose palates require explosive massive spicy action It is a beautifully filmed human story That is all
I don t know what the previous reviewer was watching but I guess that s what reviews are personal taste Missed in this movie was the depth a very deep film many layers of emotion affecting Undercurrents of withheld love because of submission to societal beliefs taboos of the times and classes race relations not being in a very good state of equality guilt yearning hate confusion very dark emotionally I thought under the skin you have to submit to the aire of it a flowing movie not slow as stated before release yourself to the flow of the film the emotions will show themselves characters reveal their flaws their nasty insides excellent and actually very cruel
Claire Denis s Chocolat is a beautiful but frustrating film The film presents a very interesting look at the household of a European colonial family living in Cameroon giving the viewer an informative perspective on the lives of many characters and their interaction However the development of these characters is often maddeningly insufficient For example a central theme in the story is young France s inability to form strong relationships with others Although this portrayal is executed flawlessly notably in the way that Denis frames the story with scenes from France s return to her childhood home the girl s lack of intimacy with the film s other characters makes it difficult for a viewer to invest much interest in her development or lack thereof as a protagonist The general stagnation of the film s character development makes it difficult to become engaged in the loosely organized plot The film raises a great deal of tension between characters particularly between Aimee and the men in her life but never fully addresses this social friction leaving the viewer unsatisfied The final few scenes are powerful but depressing Denis s work is certainly interesting from an intellectual and historical standpoint but if you are looking for a film with adventure or drama Chocolat is definitely not the best choice
This movie shows life in northern Cameroon from the perspective of a young French girl France Dalens whose father is an official for the colonial French government and whose family is one of the few white families around It gives a sense of what life was like both for the colonists and for the natives with whom they associated It s a sense consistent with another movie I ve seen about Africa in a similar time period Nirgendwo in Afrika 2001 but I have no way of knowing how realistic or typical it is It s not just an impression things do happen in the movie but the plot is understated The viewer is left to draw his own conclusions rather than having the filmmakers forced upon him although the framing of the story as a flashback from the woman s visit to south western Cameroon as an adult provides some perspective
I knew absolutely nothing about Chocolat before my viewing of it I didn t know anything about the story the cast the director or anything about the film s history All I knew was it was a highly acclaimed French film Had I known more I probably wouldn t have viewed the picture with an open mind On paper the premise doesn t sound interesting to me Had I known what Chocolat was about ahead of time my interest while watching would have been limited However not knowing about the story helped me enjoy it Throughout I had no clue has to where the story would go what the characters would do and what the end result would be It was if nothing else not a predictable film Indeed it could have been as the story is told in flashbacks Telling a story in flashbacks is often a risky move on the part of the filmmakers Since the lead character is seen in present day the audience knows she will remain alive By using the flashback technique director Claire Denis is able to ensure the audience that the young girl makes it to adulthood without any serious physical damage giving the viewer the sense that Chocolat is a story more about emotions than what is on the outside A lesser filmmaker would give France a haggard looking face one that screams of a confused and unusual childhood Instead Denis presents France as a beautiful girl someone who looks fine on the outside br br It could be argued that Chocolat is more about France s mother since she is given far more screen time though I believe it is ultimately about France To me what Chocolat is really about is how a mother s actions affect her daughter It is about how parents behavior stays with their offspring France is not ruined by her mother s actions in the story yet her mother s actions clearly made an impression on France Had France not been affected at all by her mother s actions the flashback aspect would be irrelevant br br For a movie that deals with two time periods the past and the present Chocolat was a very well paced there were no scene of excess fat None of the scenes felt gratuitous or out of the place The film had nice rhythm the editing crisp leaving only what was necessary to tell the story With a well told story solid editing and organized directing Chocolat is one of the better French films I have seen It was responsible for launching Claire Denis career and with good reason it s an incredible directorial debut
The story is about a little girl growing up in colonial Africa but it is so much more than that br br Anyone growing up in the South would experience the same things A longing for another one of a different race that cannot be consummated Even a glance is forbidden There are no words needed Their facial expressions say everything br br It is the story of a black servant Prot√©e Isaach De Bankol√© and a white woman Aim√©e Giulia Boschi Their desire for each other is so strong that they torture each other because they cannot have each other br br The little girl France C√©cile Ducasse is lonely and spends all her time with Prot√©e She really can t see this dance br br One of the more irritating aspects of the film is the laziness of the colonials They cannot even get undressed for bed by themselves There world is about to end they just don t know it yet Their racist attitudes will be erased with their presence br br I think I would like to visit this Africa It seems so quiet especially at night when you only hear the animals
I think this movie would be more enjoyable if everyone thought of it as a picture of colonial Africa in the 50 s and 60 s rather than as a story Because there is no real story here Just one vignette on top of another like little points of light that don t mean much until you have enough to paint a picture The first time I saw Chocolat I didn t really get it until having thought about it for a few days Then I realized there were lots of things to get including the end of colonialism which was but around the corner just no plot Anyway it s one of my all time favorite movies The scene at the airport with the brief shower and beautiful music was sheer poetry If you like exciting movies don t watch this you ll be bored to tears But for some of you you can thank me later for recommending it to you
I loved this film because in my mind it seemed to so perfectly capture what I imagined life in French colonial Africa must have been like in the 50 s my generation anyway But I was truly enraptured by its quiet pacing and by the glorious ending Within the last 5 minutes of this film you must focus intently on what s happening Never have I been more impressed with the wrap up of a film I remember yelling wow when I realized it was over On the other hand my two daughters fell asleep on the couch
In reflecting on this movie I can think of two others to help put it in perspective One relatively forgettable but covering the same geography is Coup de Torchon the other thousands of miles away and much larger in scope is the unforgettable Indochine Claire Denis has produced a movie that has some of the grand underpinnings of Indochine the complex and unspoken relationship between France and her colonial subjects br br I was struck with the dignity of Potee with his struggle to maintain his dignity among his peers and with his white bosses I was also struck with the love hate relationship between him and Aimee It is the latter that gives the film its driving force it is the latter that links this movie to Indochine br br One never is sure what motivates everyone though some of the characters are required of a remembrance of colonialism It is this cynical side of the story that ties it to Coup de Torchon Theirs is the more scandalous story perhaps even more interesting in a depraved way but Denis gives us a remembrance of how it was with all the tension and unresolved relationships br br The American black who gives the grown up France a ride in the beginning and end of the movie offers yet another interesting side to the confusion that we in the Western world have when we look at Africa He says that when he came he wanted to call everyone brother He was coming home but they just thought him to be a little daft France the character and the girl grew up in Cameroon but neither fully understands what it is even though they can remember how it was br br
This is an amazing film to watch or show young people Aside from a very brief nude scene it gives an interesting glimpse into colonial rule in Africa that you ll rarely find in other films It does bear a superficial similarity to OUT OF Africa but without all the romantic fluff The White French people in Cameroon are fascinating because they don t even seem to regard the natives as people The Whites are all the bosses and they expect Black servitude without question However unlike real servants you only once hear any of the Whites say thank you and no other regard is given these people Again and again it s like they are pets or slaves as the feelings of the people are never even considered br br The central illustration of this thoughtlessness is the relationship between the mother Aim√©e and her servant Prot√©e Although at times they spend a lot of time together and it is only normal that they might begin to have sexual feelings towards each other the White woman never considers Prot√©e or the existence of his feelings A good example of this thoughtlessness is when she has Prot√©e lace up her dress and it s obvious that he is very sexually frustrated by this Apart from this relationship while almost all the Whites are completely oblivious to the fact that the Africans are people a few go so far as to verbally abuse and treat them like garbage br br Also interesting is the relationship between Prot√©e and the little girl who is the one who is grown at the beginning and end of the film While they are very close at times he s more like a plaything or pet and the girl never plays with native children br br There is one bizarre White character who seems at times to regard the Blacks better but unfortunately his character is very inconsistent and confusing One moment he s doing hard work along side the Blacks or eating with them something the other Whites would never have done and the next he s trying to beat up Prot√©e I could only guess as to what motivated him perhaps he was just a jerk or was crazy or perhaps was a Communist agitator trying to stir up the Blacks against the Whites who knows In fact other than a few good scenes this character seems pretty much wasted br br While I really enjoyed the insight this movie gave I wish it had instead been more than just a few snippets of this world through the perspective of a child during one small period of her life The context and what happened to rid the country of colonialism is never addressed and the film left me wanting more The film appeared to begin in the early 1980s since she s wearing a Walkman style headset and when the film went back in time it seems that it was set about 1960 more or less but there was never any mention of the 1950s anti colonialism violence or independence for the nation in the early 1960s I am guessing that some of this confusion might be that the makers of the film screwed up and SHOULD have made the beginning of the film earlier such as the 1970s and had the lady think back to her life there in the early 1950s before the country experienced political change br br Apart from the missing context and a confusion over time periods using the prologue and epilogue that showed her as an adult traveling the country was a good idea And I also appreciated the ending as it was a pleasant surprise when you find out more about the nice man who offers her a ride But overall it just feels like something is missing there just isn t any sort of resolution or message other than showing that colonialism is thoughtless and cruel
Unfortunately because of US viewers tendency to shun subtitles this movie has not received the distribution nor attention it merits Its subtle themes of belonging identity racial relations and especially how colonialism harms all parties transcend the obvious dramatic tensions the nostalgic memories of the protaganiste s childhood and the exoticism of her relationship with her parents houseboy perhaps the only real human she knows We won t even look at her mother s relationship with this elegant man There i hope i ve given you enough of a hook to take it in whether you speak French or like subtitles or not I challenge you to be as brave strong and aware as La P tite
My 3rd year French classes always enjoyed this film very much In a multi cultural inner city high school the film provided many subjects for discussion in French in class but I know a lot of discussion went on in English after class The most obvious is the relationship between Prot√©e and Aim√©e compared to the one between Prot√©e and France br br I always mentioned that I felt this film had one of the sexiest scenes I had ever seen in a movie One year a 17 year old African American shouted Yes when he figured out the scene the one where Prot√©e is helping Aim√©e lace up her evening dress all the while both are examining the reflection of the other in the mirror Directors use the mirror technique when then want to focus on the inner conflict on the part of one or more character in a scene this is a perfect example of the technique and it is sexy br br Most students had trouble understanding the end of the film One suggested that one theme of the movie was Africanism and that no matter how much one loved Africa or Africans one cannot become African like the driver tried to do one must BE African
Set in the Cameroons in West Africa in the 1950s Claire Denis Chocolat is a beautifully photographed and emotionally resonant tone poem that depicts the effects of a dying colonialism on a young family during the last years of French rule The theme is similar to the recent Nowhere in Africa though the films are vastly different in scope and emphasis The film is told from the perspective of an adult returning to her childhood home in a foreign country France Dalens Mireille Perrier a young woman traveling through Cameroon recalls her childhood when her father Francois Cluzet was a government official in the French Cameroons and she had a loving friendship with the brooding manservant Prot√©e Isaach de Bankol√© The heart of the film however revolves around France s mother Aim√©e Giulia Boschi and her love hate relationship with Prot√©e that is seething with unspoken sexual tension br br The household is divided into public and private spaces The white families rooms are private and off limits to all except Prot√©e who works in the house while the servants are forced to eat and shower outdoors exposing their naked bronze bodies to the white family s gazes It becomes clear when her husband Marc Fran√ßois Cluzet goes away on business that Aim√©e and Prot√©e are sexually attracted to each other but the rules of society prevent it from being openly acknowledged In one telling sequence she invites him into her bedroom to help her put on her dress and the two stare at each other s image in the mirror with a defiant longing in their eyes knowing that any interaction is taboo br br The young France Cecile Ducasse also forms a bond with the manservant feeding him from her plate while he shows her how to eat crushed ants and carries her on his shoulders in walks beneath the nocturnal sky In spite of their bond the true nature of their master servant relationship is apparent when France commands Prot√©e to interrupt his conversation with a teacher and immediately take her home and when Prot√©e stands beside her at the dinner table waiting for her next command When a plane loses its propeller and is forced to land in the nearby mountains the crew and passengers must move into the compound until a replacement part can be located Each visitor shows their disdain for the Africans one a wealthy owner of a coffee plantation brings leftover food from the kitchen to his black mistress hiding in his room Another Luc Jean Claude Adelin an arrogant white Frenchman upsets the racial balance when he uses the outside shower eats with the servants and taunts Aim√©e about her attraction to Prot√©e leading her to a final emotional confrontation with the manservant br br Chocolat is loosely autobiographical adapted from the childhood memories of the director and is slowly paced and as mysterious as the brooding isolation of the land on which it is filmed Denis makes her point about the effects of colonialism without preaching or romanticizing the characters There are no victims or oppressors no simplistic good guys Prot√©e is a servant but he is also a protector as when he stands guard over the bed where Aim√©e and her daughter sleep to protect them from a rampaging hyena It is a sad fact that Prot√©e is treated as a boy and not as a man but Bankol√© imbues his character with such dignity and stature that it lessens the pain Because of its pace Western audiences may have to work hard to fully appreciate the film and Denis does not in Roger Ebert s phrase coach our emotions The truth of Chocolat lies in the gestures and glances that touch the silent longing of our heart
Despite the patronage of George Lucas this captivating and totally original fantasy in Lumage a combination of animation through live action cut outs is about as far removed from the usual kiddie fare as anything made by Ralph Bakshi in his heyday Brilliantly conceived characters such as the shape shifting dog Ralph one of a duo of bumbling rejected heroes Synonamess Botch the hilariously foul mouthed villain and Rod Rescueman the pompous novice superhero breathe life into a uniquely clever concept Frivoli vs Murkwood or the eternal fight between dreams and nightmares In this context the MOR infused songs on the soundtrack ought not to have worked but somehow they do It s a real pity therefore that I have had to watch this via a truly crappy looking boot culled from a TV screening of the uncensored version there is also a milder variant that toned down the language for its VHS release since the film is otherwise unavailable on DVD Interestingly both Henry Selick and David Fincher worked on this picture in subordinate capacities
A lush fantasy world with quirky characters and annoying 80 s music This epitomizes the 80 s desire to rewrite fairy tales and make fun of how they work Personally I liked Greensleeves and the other harsher characters They had some of the more amusing lines
You ll probably never see it but the uncut version is about 50 better than the one you can buy Put it another way once you ve seen it in its original form the current version is only half as good br br It s still wildly creative and sick a total success on so many levels br br
This is the kind of picture John Lassiter would be making today if it weren t for advances in CGI And that s just to say that he d be forgotten too if technology hadn t made things sexy and kewl since 1983 _Twice _ has got the same wit imagination and sense of real excitement that you d find in a Pixar flick only executed under the restrictions of the medium c 1983 Innovative animation techniques combine with a great script and excellent voicing to produce a movie that appeals on lots of levels It should be spoken of in the same breath with _Spiritited Away_ and _Toy Story_
One of the most unheralded great works of animation Though it makes the most sophisticated use of the cut out method of animation a la South Park the real talent behind Twice Upon a Time are the vocal characterizations with Lorenzo Music s Carlton from TV s Rhoda Woody Allen ish Ralph the all purpose Animal being the centerpiece The accidental nightmare sequence is doubtless one of the best pieces of animation ever filmed
Ralph and Mumford misfits in their own land get duped into being unwitting pawns of Synanomess Botch Twice Upon a Time is the story of them the characters they meet and their struggle to set things right With a surprisingly impressive soundtrack and wonderful voice acting by some of the best in the business this offbeat movie hits the mark br br The animation process while similar to that of the cut out South Park style is much smoother and far more three dimensional If I didn t know that the animation was this style I would swear that is was traditional pen and ink If you can watch this film in Dolby Surround or THX PLEASE DO You won t really miss anything if you don t but if you do you will get much more out of the experience
OK as far as the 2 versions of this movie There were 2 people involved in the making John Korty and Bill Couterie George was just the producer he really didn t have any kind of say so in the film just helped with money the Adult version was made possible by Bill Couterie John Korty didn t like or approve this version as it was done behind his back Thanks to Ladd films going under they didn t advertise this movie and threw all their advertising cash for The Right Stuff hoping it would pull them through and it didn t SO this movie never really had a chance When Twice made it to cable HBO they showed the reels with Bill s version and John threatened to sue if it was shown anymore did you notice how the adult version wasn t on for very long Showtime got the clean version The version on the videotape and laser disc is the version approved by John who holds more power than Bill It s a pity really as the adult version is actually better and DOES make more sense But it s VERY doubtful that it will ever be released in that version onto DVD or any other format short of bootleg Sorry to disappoint everyone I know all this info as I used to be the president of the Twice Upon A Time Fan Club still have numerous items from the movie used to own a letter boxed version of the adult version but it was stolen only have a partial HBO copy of it now 8 stars to the adult version 5 to the clean version Any other questions just ask
I went and saw Rivers and Tides again today It s the second time in two days and yes I do see movies I like as many times as is necessary Yesterday I was struck by the brilliance of the images and Goldsworthy s works This morning when I threw the coins I received 29 The Abysmal Water Goldsworthy has an affinity with water hence the title I received the 5th line changing which moved to 7 The Army To Blake Art was a War Anyway I knew I had to see the film again br br I read one of the few reviews extant Online from the SF Examiner The critic loved the film but said Goldsworthy s comments got in the way of his enjoyment of the film He d rather have only the images and the wonderful soundtrack So I was aware of that as I watched this second time br br Yesterday I thought that I d vote for Andy Goldsworthy as King of the World Well today I could get a little bit beyond the images and listen to what he had to say Could I enjoy the film without his comments What he is doing what he is saying goes way beyond art His understanding of Water Time Stone Change and on and on made me think the man is the reincarnation of Lao Tsu or some Avatar Some of his work words are Zen like His knowledge br br Anyway the film is only apparently being shown here in the Bay Area Be a Trend setter Go to your local cinema and tell them no insist that they have to book a film you ve heard about from the hinter lands It s called Rivers and Tides br br
As a person who sought out an existence as a professional person with income backed by a BS in Chemistry and MS in Business Management my sanity was always spasmodically sustained in outside indulgences in things more artistic My post post graduate classes were always emotionally and spiritually supported by an interest in photography stained glass ceramics metal forging welding and art drawing that also included silk screening br br I also keep healthy with jogging walking and lately hiking to remote destinations in California and nearby states like Utah Arizona and Nevada Jogging walking and hiking gets one close to the earth with time to stop and watch and listen and also photograph or record sounds br br Within that background I was obsessed with RIVERS AND TIDES I was equally impressed with the documentary content of artist Andy Goldsworthy as well as the skills and smoothness of Director Cinematographer Thomas Riedelsheimer I actually could not separate the art of Goldsworthy with camera path of Riedelsheimer br br Wonderful Wonderful Wonderful
br br So not being a poet myself I have no real way to convey the beauty and simplicity of this documentary The effortless motion of Goldsworthy as he molds natures beauty into his own work is captivating Watch him stick reeds together in a web hanging from a tree in a close up for a few minutes while he speaks of his work and then receive the payoff when the camera cuts to the wide shot Be amazed by the ease with which he operates and then realize the futility when a slight breeze knocks down the entire web br br The genius of Goldsworthy seemingly knows no bounds as his inspiration is nature itself It is in the essential change of nature where his work though complete in its own sphere is made whole
This film is mesmerizing in its beauty and creativity An artist s profound vision his art that springs intuitively from its natural source brings us an inspiring Hosanna blending his creations with trees white water dashing against rocks fields and rain Andy Goldsworthy makes the viewer feel joy in being alive aware that we are all made of the clay of this glorious earth He doesn t spare us his occasional frustration but on the whole we see the miracle in joining art with nature Credit also goes of course to the filmmaker Thomas Riedelsheimer who directed photographed and edited the movie with incredible sensibility and perfect timing br br If you have any feeling for beauty nature and art do not miss this fantastic film
Go see this movie for the gorgeous imagery of Andy Goldsworthy s sculptures and treat yourself to a thoroughly eye opening and relaxing experience The music perfectly complements the footage but never draws attention towards itself Some commentators called the interview snippets with the artist a weak spot but consider this why would you expand on this in a movie if you can read Andy s musings at length in his books or attend one of his excellent lectures This medium is much more suitable to show the ephemeral nature of the artist s works and is used expertly in this respect
A new way to enjoy Goldsworthy s work Rivers and Tides allows fans to see his work in motion Watching Goldsworthy build his pieces one develops an appreciation for every stone leaf and thorn that he uses Goldsworthy describes how the flow of life the rivers and the tides inspires and affects his work Although I was happy the film covered the majority of Goldsworthy s pieces no snowballs I do feel it was a bit long The film makers did a wonderful job of bringing Goldsworthy s work to life and created a beautiful film that was a joy to watch
Right at this moment I am watching this movie for the second time on television and for the second time I fell into it when it was running for an hour already I think I saw 2 minutes more this time This movie is really impressing the way Goldsworthy looks at nature changes nature in a way that you yourself would never think of really is amazing This whole movie gives you a warm feeling seeing him play with the world around him with such love Or only seeing his hands covered in dirt and with broken fingernails it just touches you
This movie is probably for you It had an overall meditative quality from the music to the beautiful photography and listening to the often clich√© things about life that Andy Goldsworthy would say as he worked or in between shots If you re familiar with Buddhism that is the sort of the sense I got out of this film The impermanence of life the beauty of nature the interconnectedness of all things etc However what I did not understand confused and ultimately forced me to leave without finishing I saw over an hour of it was the redundancy of the whole thing You only find out bits and pieces of why he s commissioned and how he can even afford to live off of this kind of work The art work comes alive but all his talking with no conclusions leads to dead ends
I first saw this absolutely riveting documentary in it s initial release back in 2001 and it really had a profound effect on me so much that I bugged several of my friends to see it with me on repeat screenings The bottom line none of my friends walked away disappointed ever This stellar film is about Scottish conceptual artist Andy Goldsworthy who creates some absolutely beautiful pieces of art using natural materials wood water flowers rocks etc to create pieces that eventually return to their natural form a statement in the temporary state of everything We get to see Goldsworthy create several works of temporary art as well as some of his long term installations in major galleries around the world as well as a few pieces in the natural world as well German film maker Thomas Riedelsheimer directs photographs edits this meditation on the creative process that is a real treat for both the eye ear with an ambient musical score composed performed by Fred Frith who s music is generally edgy experimental noise textured guitar as well as a capable ensemble of musicians Although this film has been available on DVD for some years now if you can find a cinema that is highlighting a revival of this fine film by all means seek it out it s easily a film that was composed for the large screen with a proficient sound system to truly experience this film the right way No MPAA rating but contains nothing to offend unless the live birth of a sheep on screen is destined to offend or disturb
this has by far been one of the most beautiful portraits of a person that I ve ever seen on screen Andy Goldsworthy is a kind of man that is upon extinction he views the earth and nature with such admiration and respect that it s primitive in a good sense his purity honesty and kindness breathes clearly as you watch him work in such simplistic yet full of life momentary pieces of art I was amazed how patiently he created his pieces and how patiently he accepted their end sometimes prematurely but his Scottish sense of humor covers his disappointments brilliantly the film is shoot elegantly and contains the same flow that Goldsworthy s art has it combines nature and art in a minimal way as it is in itself Fred Frith s score is organic enough that it blends everything together without interfering with it naturalistic sound this is overall a great piece of work in every aspect it has no boundaries as far as age goes
This film is stunningly beautiful Goldsworthy s art really benefits with the medium of film because you can see the art at its most beautiful moving and changing and blossoming I strongly recommend this movie to everyone I can think of nothing else to say about it It s just the kind of movie you HAVE TO see because it s so visually compelling and left me very refreshed when I left the theatre
A very engaging documentary about Scottish artist Andy Goldsworthy whose work consists mostly of ephemeral sculptures made from elements from nature His work is made of rocks leaves grass ice etc that gets blown away when the tide arrives at the beach or the wind blows at the field Thus most of Goldsworthy s works don t really last except as photos or films of what they were Now one can argue that Goldsworthy s works are a reflection of mortality or words to that effect but isn t it easier to say that what he does is just beautiful art And at a time when the stereotype about artists is that they are mostly bitter pretentious often mentally unstable people who live in decrepit urban settings Goldsworthy seems to be the opposite a stable unpretentious family oriented person who loves nature and lives in a small village in Scotland of course I m sure those are the same reasons why he s shunned by some people on the art world who found his works fluffy or superficial
The Scottish artist Andy Goldsworthy fashions natural materials into ephemeral artworks assembling rocks into egg shaped cairns filling riverside rock pools with fiery flowers and stitching thorns and twigs into intricate web patterns An original work and a few photographs of his other creations are tucked away in a corner of Southampton art gallery near where I live but although I found these pieces intriguing I only realised the wonder of Goldsworthy s work when I was lucky enough to catch a re screening of Rivers and Tides br br Thomas Reidelsheimer s film accompanied by a beautiful instrumental soundtrack by Fred Frith brings Goldsworthy and his art to life by showing the artist at work The opening scene captures him fusing icicle fragments into a snake like thread set atop a tree stump Working with his teeth and bare hands Goldsworthy crafts a beautiful ephemeral work Before long this delicate sculpture melts away to nothing in the brilliant Nova Scotian sunlight This scene is among the most beautiful in the film but the breadth and inventiveness of Goldsworthy s work is remarkable Reidelsheimer shows both the successes and the failures capturing the frustration of pieces that collapse before they are completed as well as the glory of those that shine even if for just a few hours minutes or seconds br br Goldsworthy himself provides the narration speaking slowly but thoughtfully about the themes in his work He makes plain his need to work with nature to be alone in it and to further his understanding of it through trying to work with natural materials even when they seem to be working against him At times he is down to earth and humorous at other times he struggles for the words to express his purpose something which is quite understandable when witnessing his astonishing work first hand The Rivers and Tides of the title become increasingly pertinent as we see the natural materials pass through the artist s hands flowing from one form to the next The capture of the creation and dissolution of Goldworthy s work is in itself a striking piece of art br br Although Goldsworthy works with widely varying materials and covers territory across North America and Europe the presentation of artworks one after the other in this film is exhausting it gave me the same feeling of fatigue that I get when I spend too long in an art gallery and struggle to take in anything new A brief interval in which we are introduced to Andy s family and hometown is all that breaks the long succession of his artworks Nevertheless Reidelsheimer does a superb job in photographing Goldsworthy and his creations locating them in their wider environments from meandering Canadian rivers to rainy Scottish hillsides Fittingly the film ends with Goldsworthy casting handfuls of earth and snow into the sky Fleeting patterns emerge from the dust particles even as they dissipate into the air this is the purest expression of the beauty to be found in the work of this remarkable artist
The filmmaker inhaled Andy Goldsworthy s art his search for closeness with the land and the water and his sense of proportion and so gently so beautifully breathed it back on to film for the rest of us Rivers and Tides loves Goldsworthy s work and joins it as a visual concert of time and human presence in a flowing world a world that hides its power in plain sight See this movie
Being a fan of Andy Goldsworthy s art for a while now and owning some of his books I had some expectations of what I would see What I got was something completely satisfying and quite a bit more than I expected Being an artist myself I work in clay finding inspiration within our surroundings to make good art is imperative and it is something Andy Goldsworthy has mastered Following him over the course of a year the director captures the spontaneous energy skill and devotion to the artists connection with nature with dratic inspiring flair The music set to the film is embracing and intoxicating If you are an artist in need of inspiration or anyone else in need of an uplifting experience then SEE THIS MOVIE I for one am glad to know that Andy is somewhere out there Creating dancing wrestling with the forces of nature to make our world more beautiful
This German documentary in English is about a Scottish environmental sculptor named Andy Goldsworthy He makes art from objects he finds in nature For example early in the film we see him taking sections of icicles and gluing them together with a little moisture into a serpentine shape that seems to repeatedly go through a vertical rock br br Of course the icicles melt but that transience is a part of most of Goldsworthy s work He goes to a site and gets a feeling for it deciding intuitively what to make that day He talks of having a dialog with the rocks and other materials that he works with attempting to work with rather than against them It might be stones or flowers or leaves or sticks The sculpture might last for minutes or years or might not even last long enough to be completed and photographed The work seems to be more of a process than a goal br br The film and the work is beautiful inspiring and thought provoking It moves pretty slowly which is appropriate for the material but you should be sure to go when you have had a good night s sleep But do go if you have the opportunity br br Search the web for some other pages about Andy Goldsworthy or to read about his local sculpture at Stanford University There are also several books available with photographs of his sculptures br br My thoughts Skip reading this part if you want to find what this film means to you completely independently I recall a couple of ideas that occurred to me while watching the film which I thought I would share for those of you still reading First the transitory nature of much of Andy Goldsworthy s work reminded me of the natural ebb and flow of human life We re born we live and eventually we die That s natural and that s also naturally a part of Goldsworthy s art br br The other thought was to be awestruck with the way that Goldsworthy has managed to integrate his passion and his work so thoroughly into his life Most of us have work which is tolerated at best a life which we hardly notice living and passions which we really mean to spend more time on if we even remember what they are Andy Goldsworthy has managed to create an amalgam of all of these aspects of his life that looks like it works very well and is nourishing for him and those around him Wow br br Seen on 8 28 2002
Andy Goldsworthy is a taoist master of the first order expressing the Way through his sublime ephemeral art Indeed time and change is what his work is fundamentally about I bought his first book several years ago and my family has marveled at it many times So it was a treat to get to know the artist personally through this film he is just as patient and gentle as you would expect and has some wonderful things to say about the natural world the deepest of which are expressed in his occasional inability to say it in words at all He is like most children who play in the great outdoors alone if they do anymore creating things from sticks and sand and mud and snow before they outgrow it Mr Goldsworthy was given the gift and the mission to extend that sort of play to create profound visions of nature and to open our often weary eyes to it in brilliant new ways And always with the utmost respect gratitude and humor of a wandering and wondering monk
As the jacket proclaims this film is Gorgeously shot and masterfully edited and yes it is mesmerizingly beautiful The timelessness that we perceive in stoic rock and in the unceasing ebb and flow of water frames the ephemeral works from Goldsworthy s hands so that in their very ephemeralness they point to eternity br br And so the beauty of his compositions haunt us with just a touch of melancholy woven in or in the words of Matthew Arnold from Dover Beach br br Listen you hear the grating roar Of pebbles which the waves draw back and fling At their return up the high strand Begin and cease and then again begin With tremulous cadence slow and bring The eternal note of sadness in br br At one point near the end of the film Goldsworthy says that Words do their job but what I m doing here says a lot more As a wordsmith myself I take no offense and not for a moment do I think him immodest because the combination of form and time and change and texture and color and composition that Goldsworthy painstakingly and intuitively creates is indeed something more than mere words can say br br At another point he remarks on What is here to stay and what isn t That is his theme br br I think that artists sometime in the twentieth century became acutely aware of how ephemeral even the greatest works of art are compared to the vast expanse of cosmic time and so they began to reflect this understanding by composing works that were deliberately ephemeral The idea was that by emphasizing how short lived are even the mightiest works of humans a sense of the timelessness of art would be expressed br br Perhaps part of the effectiveness of Goldsworthy s work is in this sort of expression He painstakingly composes some form of straw or leaves where the tide will reach it or places it in the river where it will be swept away and in this process is merged both the composition and its ephemerality br br Both the transitory and the timeless are necessary for us to understand our world and our place within it And it is important that these works be done within the context of nature so that what is composed is set within what is natural Thus the walls of stone and the eggs of stone that Goldsworthy constructs are silent and solid yet we know that they are not monuments to eternity but instead will stay for some undefined length of time and then dissipate and return to a state much like that which existed before we came along br br This is art as art should be akin to the spiritual br br In a sense Goldsworthy s work is an inarticulated understanding It is an experience purely of time and form In a sense his work answers Shelley s famous poem Ozymandias by saying even as the tide washes the work away and even as the river dissipates the expression even so the art lives on because of our experience of it Similarly one thinks of Tibetan sand paintings so carefully composed and measured out and then just as they are so beautifully and preciously finished they are given to the wind so that we might know that all is flux br br Yet in the modern world these works of art endure in photos and videos Goldsworthy is an accomplished photographer of necessity I would say and all his works even the unsuccessful ones he tells us are photographed so that he can look back at them in a more reflective mood and see what he has accomplished and what he has not br br This cinematic production directed by Thomas Riedelsheimer with the beautiful and appropriately haunting music by Fred Frith is not to be missed It is one of the most beautiful documentaries that I have ever seen and one of the most spiritual
Greetings again from the darkness Insight into the mind and motivation of a wonderful artist How strange for most of us to see someone who MUST work no matter the conditions else his reason for living ceases To see Goldsworthy s sculptures come alive and to see his reaction to each is extremely voyeuristic This artist creates because he must not for money or fame It is his lifeforce When you see his failures energy seems to expel from his body like a burst hot air balloon It is not the dread of beginning again it is that he takes his energy from his work Watching him create just to have nature takeover and recall his work is somewhat painful but nonetheless breathtaking He discusses flow and time in the minimal dialog and there appears to be little doubt that the artist and the earth are one in the same When he says he needs the earth but it does not need him I beg to differ Only complaint is the musical score seems to slow down further a pace that is relaxing at best
On one level this film can bring out the child in us that just wants to build sandcastles and throw stuff in the air just for the sake of seeing it fall down again On a deeper level though it explores a profound desire to reconnect with the land I thoroughly empathized with the artist when he said when I m not out here alone for any length of time I feel unrooted br br I considered Andy Goldsworthy one of the great contemporary artists I m familiar with his works mainly through his coffee table books and a couple art gallery installations But to see his work in motion captured perfectly through Riedelsheimer s lens was a revelation Unfrozen in time Goldsworthy s creations come alive swirling flying dissolving crumbling crashing br br And that s precisely what he s all about Time The process of creation and destruction Of emergence and disappearing Of coming out of the Void and becoming the Universe and back again There s a shamanic quality about him verging on madness You get the feeling watching him at work that his art is a lifeforce for him that if he didn t do it he would whither and perish br br Luckily for us Goldsworthy is able to share his vision through the communication medium of photography Otherwise with the exception of a few cairns and walls they would only exist for one person
I admit that for the first 20 minutes or so of this film I wasn t entirely sure I was going to sit through the whole thing Like many other people I found it pretty boring and I wasn t entirely looking forward to an hour and a half of watching this guy bite icicles and stick them together However if you sit through the creation of his first work long enough to see the finished product you get an idea of how impressive the rest of the film is I really think it s sad that so many people found this impossibly boring or a retread of ideas done by other artists br br Rivers and Tides is a quiet study of some of the artwork and methods of Andy Goldsworthy who makes his art entirely out of things in nature generally resulting in pieces that will be consumed by nature through the normal process of entropy It is slow moving and unglamorous but I think that a lot of the point of the movie is to show that Goldsworthy s art does not need any accompaniment in order for it to be appreciated I ve even heard people complain about how he is always talking throughout the movie rather than just letting nature and his artwork speak for themselves which I just think is madness br br On the other hand lots of people complain about CDs coming with the lyrics written out inside them A lot of musicians as well think their music should mean whatever the listener wants it to mean without the musician showing the exact lyrics I guess I m just the kind of person that believes that I d like to know what the artist was trying to accomplish with his or her artwork I can still take it how I want to even if I know what it was meant to do I can understand not wanting to hear him talk through the movie He does after all lose his train of thought and find himself unable to explain some of his work at more than one occasion but if you don t want Goldsworthy talk about his art while you re watching the film feel free to turn the sound off That s like not reading the lyrics if you don t want to know what a musician is singing and would rather interpret the words yourself br br I think that Andy Goldsworthy s work which I had no idea existed before I watched this movie is incredibly impressive and I m glad that this film was made in order to showcase it Indeed since his work is generally not the kind that can be transported into a studio photography is the only medium other than film that can express it and I really appreciated being able to see the work that goes into his art and the way that only things from nature are used Whether or not you appreciate certain aspects of how this film is presented Goldsworthy s work is moving enough to overlook that because the film is not the star Goldsworthy s art is And given the lack of any music or even the smallest special effects and the slow moving nature of the film it seems to me that director Thomas Riedelsheimer knows that
Beside the fact that in all it s awesomeness this movie has risen beyond all my expectations this masterpiece of cinema history portrait the overuse of crappy filters in it s best Paul Johansson and Craig Sheffer show a brotherconflict with all there is to it As usual a woman concieling her true intentions The end came as surprising as unforssen as the killing of Keith Scott by his older brother br br The scenes in wiking land are just as I remember it from my early time travels To be honest my strong passion for trash movies makes this one a must have in my never finished collection br br I recommend this movie to all the people in love with the most awesome brother cast from One Tree Hill br br Odin
SPOILER ALERT This Movie Zero Day Gives An Inside To The Lives Of Two Students Andre And Calvin Who Feel Resentment And Hatred For Anyone And Anything Associated With There School br br They Go On A Series Of Self Thought Out Missions All Leading Up To The Huge Mission Which Is Zero Day Zero Days Contents Are Not Specified Until The Middle To The End Of The Movie The Viewer Knows Its Serious And Filled With Hate But Is Never Quite Sure Until The End br br Now We All Know If The Movie Is Based On The Columbine Massacre The Ending Is Pretty Obvious And The Ending Is No Different Than Any Other Movie About The Attack They go And Kill Many Of Their Fellow Students In The End br br I Have Seen A lot Of Movies On This Attack And This Movie By Far Is My Favorite And Most Respected It Gives The Viewer And Inside Look To The Lives Of These Two Teens Who Hate Life And Honestly It Gives The Viewer Some What Of An Understanding And A Closure On The Horrible Event br br Being Only 7 When The Events Played Out I Never Knew The Seriousness Of The Shootings Until My English Class Was Assigned An Essay Or Story On A Defining Moment In Our Generation Well I Knew Everyone Was Going To Pick The Twin Towers But I Wanted To Be Different Because Of Course The Twin Towers Was Tragic And Very Defining But I Didn t Think It Was The Right Choice For Me Because there was Really No Way Of Relating To that Because I Was Only In The 3rd Grade And I Had No Idea What It All Meant But The Shootings Did Leave And Effect I Remember The Interviews The Sky Views Of The School And The Hurt And Terror In The Eyes Of Thousands Of People br br This Movie Is A Compelling Down To Earth And Horrific Masterpiece And I Would Reccomened It To Anyone
I saw this film at the Rhode Island International Film Festival and was completely blown away The structure and execution of the film was fantastic I know it won t but it really deserves an Oscar nod Cal and Andre were phenomenal as the two disturbed classmates Yes the film is very controversial and I can see a lot of people having a lot of problems with it as it deals with school shooting and especially makes you identify with the killers However despite its harsh and blunt subject matter Zero Day is SO worth watching I m looking forward to it coming out on video so I can buy it it s very very good Very powerful and intense the end shooting sequence leaves you speechless because it s almost too realistic Their uncertainty the recordings the footage and panic of the students totally indescribable I really hope it gets the attention it deserves It s done in the same format as The Blair Witch Project handheld camera made to appear as a true home video documentary kind of film but god is it INFINITELY better Very impressive hats off to everyone involved If you ve got the chance you really should see it
What is most disturbing about this film is not that school killing sprees like the one depicted actually happen but that the truth is they are carried out by teenagers like Cal and Andre normal kids with normal families By using a hand held camera technique a la Blair Witch Ben Coccio succeeds in bringing us into the lives of two friends who have some issues with high school although we aren t ever told exactly what is behind those issues They seem to be typical a lot of people hate high school so what A part of you just doesn t believe they will ever carry out the very well thought out massacre on Zero Day The surveillance camera scenes in the school during the shooting are made all the more powerful for that reason You can t believe it s really happening and that it s really happened The hand held camera technique also creates the illusion that this is not a scripted movie a brilliant idea given the subject matter
This film is scary because you can find yourself relating to ideas they have and can recall other people saying and having simialr ideas make this a haunting well done movie the camra style is not shakey to point it draws you out of film like blair witch it only adds to the raw real feeling of the film that makes it
I was lucky enough to see Zero Day last night It s an amazing movie A very disturbing one at that br br In a way Zero Day is very comparable to The Blair Witch Project It s shot completley with handheld camcorders It s about 2 kids Just your average kids Andre and Calvin They start a campaign against there High School entitled Army of 2 br br The whole story is told in Video Diary form from the 2 kids It shows there relationships with there parents amongst other people showing that these are just normal kids just like people we know or who have bumped into We find out The Army of 2 s last mission will be entitles Zero Day They plan to shoot up there High School br br You see how they get access to there guns how they plan it out everything They stress that the media has not affected them at all and there is no reason for doing this Like I said this is all told in Video Diary form and then they store the tapes in a safety deposit box to be seen after Zero Day br br The actual shooting is shown through Survillence Cameras throughout the school Chilling indeed The movie is very chilling Some of the things they say how they plan it out you d just have to see it for yourself One quote that I remember is the only time Calvin is byhimself He says Andre thinks were just gonna leave in some getaway car doing this to numerous schools across the country I don t know what he s thinking but the only way I m coming out of the school is in a black plastic bag br br I m probaly not even giving you guys the proper idea of this film You really need to see it yourself It s going around festivals right now br br A
This is the best movie I ve come across in a long while Not only is this the best movie of its kind school shooting The way Ben Coccio the director decided to film it was magnificent He filmed it using teenage actors who were still attending high school He filmed it in the actors own rooms and used the actors real parents as their parents in the film Also the actors were filming too using camcorders making it seem much more like a video diary It is almost artful if that is indeed a word There are a few slip ups however for example when Cal calls brads land rover a range rover or vice versa It s been awhile since I ve seen it
I am frankly surprised how little has been done in film on the Columbine Massacre There isn t a major documentary very puzzling Fortunately we are graced with the talent of Ben Coccio who directed ZERO DAY and Gus Van Sant who did the equally fine ELEPHANT Two different takes on the event which have in common the idea that the real cause of the massacre will always be a mystery that there s something ultimately baffling and unknowable about the motivations of the two killers and what actually drove them to carry it beyond fantasy into horrible reality ZERO DAY purportedly made up of videotapes made by the shooters and found after the event is absolutely riveting Even if you know where it s going you still harbor hope that it WON T go there and the tension in the final minutes of the movie is excruciating The film is terrific from top to bottom from director to script not much improvised though it appears very spontaneous to the two lead actors and the supporting players as well There is only one aspect of ZERO DAY that troubled me Okay so we can t fathom why the shooters would do what they did but certainly one of the contributors was their ANGER Yet these boys don t really seem angry They may say some things to indicate that they are but in fact they didn t convince me that they had SOMETHING inside them that compelled them to kill innocent people But this still leaves me with the sense of why that director Coccio wants me to have Anyway rent or buy this movie it will creep up on you and stay with you for a long time The BLAIR WITCH folks could only WISH for the kind of success these guys had at making a mock documentary
Everyone knows about this Zero Day event What I think this movie did that Elephant did not is that they made us see how these guys were They showed their life for about a year Throughout the movie we get to like them to laugh with them even though we totally know what they re gonna do And THAT gives me the chills Cause I felt guilty to be cheered by their comments and I just thought Cal was a sweet guy Even though I KNEW what was gonna happen you know Even at the end of the movie when they were about to commit suicide and just deciding if they did it on the count of 3 or 4 I thought this was funny but still I was horrified to see their heads blown off Of course I was I got to like them They were wicked maybe but I felt like they were really normal guys that they didn t really realize it But I knew they were br br That s IMO the main force of this movie It makes us realize that our friends or relatives or anyone can be planning something crazy and that we won t even notice it This movie as good as it was made me feel bad And that s why I can t go to sleep right now There s still this little feeling in my stomach Butterflies

I am a big fan of cinema verite and saw this movie because I heard how interesting it was I can honestly say it was very interesting indeed The two lead actors are awesome the film isn t ever boring and the concept behind it though obviously inspired by the Columbine killings and the home movies of the killers is really interesting There are some weaknesses such as the final 20 minutes which really detracts from the realism seen in the first hour or so and the ending really doesn t make any sense at all The shaky camera sometimes can be a distraction but in cinema verite that is a given But I still think the movie is very well done and the director Ben Coccio deserves some credit
As a fan of looking further into the phenomenon that is school shootings this film took an interesting and different approach to the idea Presented as a series of video recordings made by the two troubled men I cannot refer to persons who kill as boys or teens the months of preparation leading to zero day the codename for the day on which they will attack the film tries to present the situation from the opposite end of the gun It seems intent on portraying the pain they suffer yet focuses on the literal preparation The problem is that little in terms of emotion is directly delivered The only point at which emotion became overwhelming was the ending as expected But leading up to this point it s never really clear as to why they are planning this out We are told the obligatory story that they were mocked but the film also seems to contradict this Without ruining the film it s easy to say it was a great attempt and had equally great intentions but falls short because of sloppy film making All directing is amateur to further the homemade video concept but the story and continuity is weak The film seems to want the audience to decide a lot but also fails to provide the information for such an event The ending is abrupt and doesn t feel like it finishes everything that the film began
Zero Day is a film few people have gotten to see and what a shame that is br br When I saw the end where the two main characters descend upon the room and mercilessly kill people then commit suicide and it made me grab my stomach I was shaking that s how strong this movie is br br The movie is amazing It s too incredible not to get a perfect ten It s sad that so few people understand the true beauty of this film It is not a budget which makes a film good it is the amount of feeling the makers put into it which makes it good br br It leaves a permanent impression in your mind that you simply cannot get out It makes you realise the true horror of shootings especially if you were to know that person and this movie makes you feel like you know these people br br I recommend Zero Hour to those who feel they are mature enough to watch it I am fourteen and I feel that this film is just too amazing to be put into words It feels like you re watching something that actually happened
This movie is one for the ages First I have to say after seeing this once it became one of my all time favorite movies Why Simple Ben Coccio writer director has put together a true piece of art Where 99 9 of movies these days are purely entertainment director Ben Coccio gives us truth gives us reality gives us a learning tool to know why this happened The mainstream media spins and spins but Ben Coccio looks school shootings right in the face able to go where no other form of media has EVER gone before into the minds and hearts of two young men planning to kill their classmates While it surely is graphic and horrifying how couldn t it be The gloves come off the lies and the sugar coating of our media masters is brushed aside and we are taken to a place where we can find truth in what happened Sometimes it isn t just a screw loose like everyone likes to think no sometimes hatred and isolation are deeper are more human we are shown that these boys are us and we them Society left them behind and the consequences are horrifying and real br br Respect and love your fellow man A lesson we all should learn thank you so much for making this film Mr Coccio I hope with great anticipation that you will continue your film making career
Zero day has a purpose and this is not simply entertainment it delivers a message about its specialised subject school shootings Charting the lives of two friends Andre and Cal leading up to an attack on their high school br br Whilst the movie started in somewhat unassuming fashion an impromptu announcement of the coming attack in amateurish teenage style followed by some brief encounters with the boys families It is not long before we are down to business with the boys showing us their collection of guns their fetishistic love of them their sprawling sporadic narcissistic fantasies and even in a controversial scene how to build pipe bombs br br So what is the movie trying to say What is really motivating these soon to be killers It seems hard to really pinpoint They certainly do not come across as cold blooded psychopaths yet they are planning an act of sheer brutality This brings me to what I feel is the genius in part of Zero day Cal and Andre talk constantly about how much they are on a different level how above the rest of us they are and how they will leave us all behind Like the columbine killers they truly feel superior Like Nietzsche s res sentiment Cal and Andre s value system seems to have been born out of rejection from their society Yet we are given only glimpses of this an expression of hatred for a popular athlete for example So where is the motivation What I feel is that Coccio portrayed two individuals desperate to make a statement of superiority a gesture of their power yet who have no reasonable venue for it Hence they turn to mass murder and the kind of which that will garner them more attention than they could ever realise This is why in part school shooters seem able to carry out atrocious acts despite coming from good stable loving homes The murder is part of a fantasy Cal and Andre are totally lost in their fantasy they almost fail to see the reality of their actions They turn fantasy into tragedy br br What is secondly most enthralling about this film is the character development and the unique dependence Cal and Andre have on each other Andre is throughout the film overtly the leader of the two Cal s embrace of his demeanour and attire seem somewhat forced Andre is uptight Andre is intense and serious He completely shuns others except for his family he is meticulous and precise about everything he does and for a while appears the prime mover in the plot to attack the school Yet he is likable in his own way he does not embrace teenage nonsense and in part we feel compelled to agree with him yet these moments are shattered by Andre s fleeting gestures of violence towards us the audience treating us as both confidante and potential victim Cal on the other hand seems more relaxed than Andre more accepting of reality Yet he is in his own way dominant We have many personal moments of introspection with Cal s video diary scenes when he is alone and apart from Andre Cal seems to be struggling with his own personal demons and using their plan to exorcise himself of them Andre is jealous of Cal going to the prom with an old friend he wants Cal all to himself Cal placates Andre and encourages him For the first time in his life Andre seems to have found someone who believes in him and who admires him he cannot lose it Whilst Cal has found someone offering him a way out br br The movie certainly picks up pace and improves as it nears its grim conclusion There is an excellent moment when Cal attends the high school prom Suddenly the star of the movie becomes shy and introverted not at all at ease with his peers Yet we are inclined to feel more connection with Cal than with the raucous bawdy crowd screaming juvenile obscenities whilst drinking heavily in their limo Theirs is an episode all too common and recognisable We do not want to relate to them when it is over and Cal is back with Andre silently preparing one of their final videos we like the characters feel once again at ease safe in the fantasy world they created We feel like shunning the masses as they have br br The penultimate scene is superb The final video sees Andre and Cal arming themselves in their car just moments before attacking It is all too real and truly creates a sense of impending doom By know we know Cal and Andre and are realising they are about to actually do it with a kind of morbid fascination we are also relishing the films catharsis br br The massacre shot in CCTV fashion is at times shocking and whilst it was certainly the perfect choice to depict the massacre if we were going to it is not void of flaws What is most significant is the sudden radical change of perception we have of Cal and Andre looking at them in the this person suddenly they are the callous killers we knew they would become yet refused to acknowledge that they would It is violent and real our heroes have become monsters and the reality of their fantasy is a terrible tragedy which costs them everything br br The final scene shows a group of teens filming themselves burning the crosses erected for Andre and cal in disgust that they have been memorialised Having known Andre and Cal we can only feel almost a sadness that they are actually gone forever and that they certainly did not win anything br br Zero day is a must see for anyone interested in these violent acts sensationalised by the media It is a character study well worth experiencing
zero day is based of columbine high school massacre and its a video diary of two boys at first you don t know whats going to happen you think it is just a bad student film until they start talking about the horrible things they are going to do in this quite school until they start talking about pipe bombs and guns and going shooting in the woods they is a lot to say about this movie all know this film is well a film you forget you watching a film and watching a real video two boys made br br the two boys act like they are in a weird cult they burn all there stuff like play station games books dvds homework stuff school stuff these two boys can be anybody your friends you brothers or the people you see walking down the street it goes through there daily actives and that is making a gun in the videos they make it mentions the bullying that happens to them and how people said stuff about there clothes and the things you are into I m not saying its right but many people do do things like that br br and also the thing is with this people are suspected to like it because of the sensitive topic they have chosen on this film br br so thats my review on zero day br br and lets just say the end shooting scene is messed up
In my honest opinion everyone should see this movie at least once It really put things in perspective as I watched it Though it was fictional this movie is about something that could happen to your children br br It shows how easily two kids can hide both their hatred for their school and their plans to murder innocent students This film would not have worked in any other format They pulled off the hand held camera perfectly br br It reminds us of April 20th 1999 when Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold murdered 12 students and then themselves It also reminds us of the media storm that followed after Everyone wanted to see the Rampart video and everyone wanted to see the Basement tapes br br This movie is a fictional version of our dreams coming true We get to see the kid behind the monster br br The only bad thing about this movie is that it did not do well on the market and few people even know it existed If it would have had a single preview on a single blockbuster movie everyone would have gone to see what the big deal was about Zero Day br br I believe this is the best film adaptation of a school shooting of the few that have truly attempted it The shooting itself only takes up about ten minutes of the hour and a half long film because It mostly focuses on Cal and Andre and what they did up to that point br br If you have not yet seen this movie go rent it and watch it I guarantee that when it is finished you will be speechless
Chris and Andre are two average ordinary teens Misunderstood by some and picked on by others But together they stand and all will pay Together they form The Army of Two They scheme and plan Zero Day That day is when they decide to storm their high school and inevitably murder 14 people in cold blood Told through the tapes that they made Zero Day it is barely a fictionalized telling of the Columbine tragedy br br Zero Day is one of those movies that will mess with your head afterwards The two main actors Calvin Robertson and Andre Keuck do such a good job that their characters seem like almost any disenfranchised teen walking the street Their performances were very believable you kinda liked these guys and that was scary Shot on video almost totally from the teen s perspectives Zero Day feels very real and authentic like you are right there These kids try to rationalize their actions to the viewer and the actors sell it to you But be warned it does follow the tragedy from beginning to end and the ending makes be shocking and uneasy for some
This movie was excellent a bit scary but excellent at that For those of you that have heard of columbine and know the story it gives you a idea of what and why these kids did what they did In the back of your mind you know that people think of this stuff but you never realize just how bad it is and this movie makes you realize It s seriously that good It also makes you think twice before you make fun of someone that s for sure I read a book on the columbine massacre and it made me think this movie makes me worry and scares me to death On the downside it s like a how to kill someone guide for serial killers I recently received a threat and I blew it off thinking nothing of it but after this movie I think you should take everything seriously Some people are crazy and you never truly know which they are so take it seriously and don t under estimate someone
Cutting to the chase This is one of the most amazing most intense film I ve seen in a long time The first movie in years that left me absolutely staggered I could barely feel my way out of the theatre I was so overwhelmed br br I ve been staring at the screen for about fifteen minutes trying to find some way to describe the power of this film and just failing Highlighting any one aspect of it the documentary style video diary format the unflinching portrayal of the events the force of the characters just seems to trivialise it all Some may find it laughable that any killer could be characterised as normal But then not all killers are raving lunatics foaming at the mouth Many are quite regular unassuming people They re just wired differently br br And that s perhaps the most chilling thought of all
High school friends Andre Kriegman and Cal Gabriel declare war on their classmates and plan a terrifying assault on their high school As they begin the deadly countdown to their final act of revenge the two start a video diary to explain their feelings and chronicle their mission br br There is another similar movie like this called Elephant Why do I bring this up To compare the two films of course I have to say even though I liked Elephant this is a much better film What s the difference you ask Well for starters this is shot differently much along the lines of Cloverfield Blair Witch Project and Diary of the Dead This makes the movie all the better because it s much more painfully realistic br br But what won me over was how the movie was willing to show the other side of the story You get to know these two shooters unlike Elephant I actually cared for one of the shooters and could understand their actions and why they did what they did This movie actually makes you feel sympathetic to these people and that s a good thing because it s not always black and white br br To be honest this is why I almost cried in this movie The characters are real human beings with logic and reasons behind their actions You get to understand them It s not like they want to kill people for attention Overall this film is emotionally gripping and very haunting and much better than Elephant
This movie is essentially shot on a hand held camera by the actors in it In some ways a mockumentary in other ways a video diary from killers it is full on account of a Columbine style attack While this movie does not answer all the big questions it does give you an insight into how easy it would be to get away with Through the movie you are shown how the actors illegally shortened shot guns made pipe bombs and came up with an action plan for Zero Day The actors if you can call them that were brilliant they obviously borrowed heavily from there own lives but at no stage did I detect them really acting Something Tom Cruise should try The use of the CCTV and the 911 operator at the end was genius but I m not sure if we needed the very last scene Overall though a really good movie on a very tough topic
The thing that makes this movie so scary is the way that it portrays Andre and Calvin as relatively normal guys These are definitely not people who want to become professional filmmakers since they goof around in front of the camera forget scripted lines etc They are only making the video as a diary to show the survivors how normal their lives were Their parents just think the guys are filming for a family home video By researching other kids attacks on their schools Andre and Calvin learn what not to do and they inform usually in a silly This Old House kind of way any potential Andres and Calvins who might be watching this video how to make bombs get weapons and not get caught before Zero Day the day of the attack
I just came back from the Montreal premiere of Zero Day and i m surprised as hell to find a negative comment on the movie Basically the blame is about Coccio doing an easy and overplayed social message well Mr I m a reviewer it s an easy and overplayed critic of movies with a social charge br br Not that I want to expose my life here but I come from a small town with a similar school than these guys go Reject ignorance on the menu Thing is I understand how can young kids can be driven to do such horror High schools have became battle fields of conformity It s a real ugly sight You need to fight your way into being like the others It s hard to explain bit a lot of people dosen t realize that high schools are becoming cemeteries of human intelligence Meanwhile parents are closing their eyes and smiling about how their life in their comfortable suburb is perfect br br The real motive of the movie isn t about what is driving them It s about this death like calm suburb and everybody closing their eyes and trying to create this atmosphere of a perfect town Cal expressed it well It s a wake up call Drama is everywhere and it can take every shape In that case little dramas like Andre being called a faggot for wearing a J C Penny shirt are shaping into being the worse nightmare of a whole town Andre Cal took the most extreme way to express their pain The malaise of unconformity in an era where you need more than ever to be like the others to be accepted br br I like particularly the last scenes where some guys are burning the crosses of Andre Cal like if with the pain they communicated Cal Andre have communicated their blind rage to their community their refusal to think about the causes of some acts br br It might seemed aggressive as a movie but Coccio is meditating more than whining or enunciating What Andre Cal are living is a reality and a scary one that might get to other kids br br Disturbing movie Home making and strong feeling made Ben Coccio do a very very disturbing movie
Zero Day leads you to think even re think why two boys young men would do what they did commit mutual suicide via slaughtering their classmates It captures what must be beyond a bizarre mode of being for two humans who have decided to withdraw from common civility in order to define their own mutual world via coupled destruction br br It is not a perfect movie but given what money time the filmmaker and actors had it is a remarkable product In terms of explaining the motives and actions of the two young suicide murderers it is better than Elephant in terms of being a film that gets under our rationalistic skin it is a far far better film than almost anything you are likely to see br br Flawed but honest with a terrible honesty
Saw this movie at the Rotterdam IFF You may question some decisions of the maker like choosing a mockumentary form for such a sensitive and horrible subject but this movie sure hits you in the gut Especially the last scenes were almost painful to watch Hope it gets the distribution it deserves
As always controversial movies like this have mixed reviews You either love it or you hate it and not everyone will like this movie This shows the perspective of the killers which is something I personally feel is something important to consider You may hate them you may claim to understand them and feel as though you can relate but regardless this movie will make you think about school shootings from a different perspective br br The movie is shot entirely using a hand held camera something that I think works quite well as it makes it more realistic It is told completely from the killers point of view from their missions to family outings all leading up the big day Zero Day in which they are planning on a massacre at their school Zero Day does not offer answers but merely presents a glimpse at the lives of two troubled young boys and lets the audience decide for themselves Our feelings towards the boys are something mixed between sympathy and hatred but yet we are left confused as to why two ordinary young boys would do such a thing They are shown to be surprisingly normal typical teenage boys leading ordinary lives and if we didn t know what they were planning we wouldn t expect a thing They make it clear throughout the whole movie that no one else knows about their plan br br The acting is extremely good considering the two actors are complete unknowns We can only hope to see more work from the both of them in the future Despite how this is a fictionalized movie one cannot help but notice the obvious similarities to Columbine Calvin and Andre are scarily similar to Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold not so much in looks but in manner As someone who has researched Columbine very extensively I could see the similarities and it is almost certainly based on it br br The actual massacre is shown through surveillance cameras at the school and is one of the most chilling things I have ever seen I was completely in shock after seeing it and its a feeling that stays around for a while It is very realistic and well done and it is very difficult to watch br br All in all Zero Day is an excellent movie and I think everyone should at least check it out In the past we have always simply branded killers psychopaths and assumed that either they were biologically wired for disaster or had media influence but as Zero Day shows sometimes the motives are deeper than that and we can never truly understand why tragedies such as school shootings happen until we have seen it from the perspective of the killers
I rented Zero Day from the local video store last week I had never heard of the film and I had my reservations about it Just from looking at the box I knew the film was an Indie film and therefore the quality was going to be less than a mainstream film br br I can tell you that after I finished watching Zero Day I immediately started it from the beginning again The film was clearly following the basic outline of what happened at Columbine High School of April of 1999 but what struck me was how believable the two lead actors were My first time through watching this film I wasn t entirely sure if what I was watching were actual tapes left behind by the shooters at Columbine In the back of my mind I knew what I was watching could not be real but at the same time the acting was so convincing you had to keep giving your head a shake br br Is the film disturbing Absolutely Are you going to see things that will make you question the merit of the film Probably I think what most people will find disturbing is they will actually have feelings for the two lead characters Calvin and Andre Played by Cal Robertson and Andre Keuck Why is that problematic for some people Calvin and Andre are planning a massacre at their high school I know for myself I felt an immense sadness for Andre and Calvin I had empathy for them because their lives had come to such a horrific point They had fallen so deeply through cracks that they had begun a journey down a road which could have been stopped if only people around them had taken notice to their plight br br Zero Day is a phenomenal film It gives you an up close and personal look to events that most of us will only ever see the conclusion to on the news It leaves you thinking about the lives involved And it leaves you perplexed how people get to this point A week after seeing this film I still think about it br br Those of you who have not seen Zero Day please keep in mind the following The film is an independent with little to no budget and the film is shot on camcorders The material in the film is disturbing This is not mainstream Hollywood and there is no happy ending br br But if you can put all that aside Zero Day is a film that will stick with you and just maybe help you to open your eyes a little
If you re looking for a Hollywood action packed kid flick with the common bad language and violence this may not be the film to sit down for If you re on the other hand interested in watching a film with youre children that has actually some values like showing the importance of friendship and truth this is the film to watch Looking at the program guide this is obviously what millions of other viewers have found Not many low budget independent films have ever been aired as much as Mr Atlas The film is actually very funny as well as warm hearted and shows some beautiful locations masterfully captured by the sharp eye of the obvious brilliant cinematographer Suki Medencevic Also if you re interested in looking at a muscular fellow with good looks the ladies can get an eye full Let s support those who make good childrens film buy buying their videos and watching their products on TV Enjoy
i watched this film many years ago and have searched for it ever since in my opinion although very raw it is very educational as to what the future can hold i enjoyed the movie and to this this day rate it very high sorry to all those that disagree but a movie should always be judged each to there own and in my opinion its great give it a go with all the cloning and test tube babies that are happening today who are we to judge this film this may be a dramatised event of what is to become but there you go All the horrors of today are so far fetched even i laugh but this one gets me thinking and it scares me as a mother what if i was desperate after watching this movie i would think twice sorry but i love the movie make your own mind up don t watch the movie making just aknowledge the story and ask yourself this how far would you go for a child
The Unborn is a very very different film James Karen Brooke Adams are in the film and they performed quite well this film is builds up solidly and it keeps you going Though I think you must be a horror fan to watch this because of the scenes and the plot There is one brief sex scene with no nudity that could have been left out and to some people this scene may disappoint someone like Me that s into the film and thinks that stuff ruins a good film but that s it when it comes to that There is a scene where Adams character goes nuts and kills a cat but you can tell its not real The music is very different but very good The Unborn in My opinion is a really creepy film that s superbly unpredictable and that s quite strange I recommend all horror fans to this movie
The Unborn tells the tale of a married couple named Virginia Brooke Adames Bradley Marshall Jeff Hayenga who have tried for the last five years to conceive Virginia has had two miscarriages since then is desperate to have a child They visit Dr Richard Meyerling James Karen for help after he is recommended by some of their friends Dr Meyerling says he will be able to help them have a child Dr Meyerling operates on Virginia it is soon confirmed that the surgery has been a success Virginia is pregnant At first everything seems perfect the Marshall s couldn t be happier but their picture perfect lives don t last for long as Virginia s pregnancy develops problems she becomes moody acts totally out of character she receives a worrying phone call from Beth Jane Cameron another woman who has undergone Dr Meyerling s procedure who claims that Meyerling is in fact using his patients for his own sinister ends is in fact a disgraced genetic researcher Virginia begins to question just what is growing inside of her br br Produced directed by Rodman Flender I actually thought The Unborn was a decent horror thriller it s DEFINITELY NOT a sci fi film as the IMDb would have you believe that pleasantly surprised me The script by Henry Dominic tries to be different it must take some credit for that at least The Unborn goes for psychological horror rather than cheap scares bad special effects it s got quite a clever story that works plays on basic human fears It moves along at a fair pace although it s not exactly an action packed film by any means The climax was good seemed a fitting way to round things off the warnings about messing around with genetics seem even more relevant today than it must have been back then maybe Flender knew something the rest of us didn t On the down side it lacks some exploitation elements is at heart a dialogue driven film mostly focusing on one person so it can get a bit dull at times Also I have to mention it what on Erath was that grinning black skateboarding dwarf all about eh br br Director Flender does an OK job The Unborn is far from the most stylish or visually interesting film ever made but it s good enough The atmosphere is good there s a fair bit of tension as what Virginia has inside of her Dr Meyerling s sinister plans aren t fully revealed until the last possible moment Disappointingly the blood gore is almost non existent which in a way lets the film down because in retrospect nothing really memorable happens The Unborn relies on good storytelling which is fine but in a week I doubt I ll remember too much about it br br Technically the film is OK I d imagine that The Unborn had a pretty low budget but it s well made even if it s a little bland forgettable The baby creature is actually a decent special effect has fairly realistic facial movement The acting is good this was one of the first acting jobs credited to Friends 1994 2004 star Lisa Kudrow I have to be honest I don t like Friends I don t even know who she was in this so I can t tell you how she did br br The Unborn is a good horror thriller that deserves to be more widely known seen it s far better than a lot of low budget crap that litter video shop shelves If your a horror fan are looking for something a bit different something slightly more intelligent thought provoking than usual then I think you could do a lot worse than The Unborn Followed by a dumbed down sequel The Unborn II 1994 which I watched straight after this check my review out if you want
The Unborn is a pretty good low budget horror movie exploiting the fears associated with pregnancy It s very well acted by the always good Brooke Adams and b movie stalwart James Karen although the supporting cast is pretty average for a b grader The music by Gary Numan of all people is good too Henry Dominic s script is quite intelligent for this sort of thing although there is a hint of misogyny about it Rodman Fender s direction is merely adequate and there are some unnecessary cheap scares If you re a fan of Adams whose movie career is nowhere near as illustrious as it should be check it out she s great as always
The Unborn is a Roger Corman production and as such is nasty and tasteless If you hate pregnant women check out this movie because it s chock full of preggo killings and failed abortions Brooke Adams stars as Virginia Her and her square of a husband go to some fancy fertilization clinic because they can t have kids on their own There they meet Dr Meyerling James Karen of ROTLD 1 2 Dr Meyerling has had a very high success rate at getting couples pregnant Insert joke here Is it because he s creating some genetic killer supermutant babies That s what Virginia starts to think when she starts having some odd side effects and extreme moodiness from the treatment That s when she starts taking matters into her own hands br br On this one you ll have to get the rest of the details somewhere else because if I told ya all the goodies this one had you might hurt yourself putting it on your Netflix rental queue too quickly It s a bit slow moving for a while but once it picks up in the final third all systems are go Very highly recommended by me on the strengths of its un PC fetal violence 33 1 2 out of seventeen stars
We saw this at one of the local art movie theaters in the Montrose area of Houston TX It was a total surprise compared to the write up in the theater s newsletter but we were both blown away by the artistry It was beautifully done and apparently photographed in a schloss German name for ch√¢teau somewhere in the Munich area It is a very explicit exploration of the sexual relationships of a group of twentyish men and women isolated from the day to day constraints It is fantastic on more levels than I can remember We came home after the movie and talked and talked until about 4 am the next morning br br The version we saw was in English mostly so there must be at least two versions since the first reviewer saw the movie in probably its original German version I searched and searched for a video tape version but never came up with anything Would absolutely love to have a VHS or DVD version of this It explores relationships at a fundamental level and is also a great tutorial on how to relate to your partner If anyone knows the writer director please convince him to release again preferably on DVD these days I cannot even imagine getting tired of watching the candid performance of the actors who are now probably all in their forties Please please bring it back
Love this film also Saw it when it was first shown i8n Germany in a small independent cinema in Frankfurt It was really crowded and it was a very ambitious atmosphere to The erotic of the movie hit the spectators and the discussion with Moritz Boerner the producer and director was always underlined by that In his genre it was a very ambitious movie even especially when you think that it was an independent movie br br It doesn t exist much copies of that film Mortitz Boerner came from the theatre and made two or three short movies more worked for TV as well before he became a sort of therapist br br For the people who wish to see that movie again you could find it on his homepage which isn t that easy to search for but its possible
This is one of the very few movies out there which are very erotic without being pornographic despite there being only a very rudimentary plot There s not much live sound or dialogue instead the actors do voice overs describing their experience why they participated etc br br It s a document br br It s mind blowing br br I can totally understand why nobody else ever tried to do something like this There already is something like this This br br NB The producer doesn t have the rights to distribute a DVD version I ve also never seen it being sold anywhere one may email Mr Boerner and order a copy on VHS
Kolchak the Night Stalker is a hugely entertaining TV series in which a pushy sarcastic forty something reporter is repeatedly drawn into mortal combat with supernatural and occasionally extraterrestrial forces Based on a very popular pair of TV movies featuring the Kolchak character this series died a quick death in the mid 1970s due to low ratings but it nevertheless maintains a strong cult following today But will the average modern day viewer be able to dig Kolchak and his weekly clashes with the undead br br That s actually a tough question to answer fairly Detractors of this series tend to argue that it s formulaic and hopelessly dated On the other hand fans argue that it s cleverly written well acted and sometimes genuinely spooky And me I ve got a foot in both camps I thoroughly enjoyed watching all 20 episodes of Kolchak on DVD recently though I can plainly see that the series has major flaws br br I ll address the question of Kolchak being formula fiction first Now I think we can all agree that most TV shows have formulas just about every episode of Columbo unfolds according to the same pattern for example Repetition is not necessarily a bad thing in itself in fact critics have long recognized that audiences often enjoy and actively seek out repetitive entertainment However the problem with Kolchak is that its formula is simply TOO rigid it s too repetitive even by the most generous standards br br In almost every episode Kolchak investigates a murder and figures out that it was committed by some form of monster He tries to publish a story about said monster but his editor Vincenzo blocks him always on the grounds that Kolchak doesn t have sufficient evidence to support his claims that supernatural forces are at work And alas Kolchak is also obstructed by the police So in the end Kolchak does some independent research on the monster figures out how to kill it and then kills it Without ceremony or reward or writing a big story about it br br You can see where this ever so strict formula might get tiresome right I m particularly mystified by Vincenzo if Kolchak s always raving about monsters and Vincenzo never believes it well then why doesn t Vincenzo fire Kolchak or have him committed That s what any normal boss would do But the series eschews such realism and prefers to keep Vincenzo and Kolchak as comical antagonists As a result many of their scenes together are profoundly unbelievable though they are also quite funny br br The very best episodes of Kolchak manage to vault over the limitations of this formula however usually because they contain some kind of unexpected twist These select episodes are good enough that I think they re largely immune to typical criticisms of the series Some of my favorites include br br Horror in the Heights an episode that s noteworthy for being grimy inventive and socially aware Kolchak s dialog has an unusually sharp and cynical edge Though it adheres closely to the Kolchak formula the script written by Hammer Studios veteran Jimmy Sangster is remarkably literate and it delves deeply into the monster s backstory br br The Devil s Platform a possible inspiration for the Omen films this episode stands out to me because the villain a very young Tom Skerritt tempts Kolchak with a satanic contract full of goodies and in so doing reveals a lot about the reporter s character br br Firefall this episode appears to have a bad reputation among fans but I enjoyed it because it s got a great red herring and a really creepy almost unstoppable seeming monster br br Though I ve singled out these three episodes for praise I d say that most of the stories are entertaining at the very least For my money there are only two complete turkeys in the 20 episode run Primal Scream which is about monkey men running rampant in Chicago and the Sentry which features the dumbest looking creature makeup in the history of filmed entertainment and this assessment is coming from a lifelong Doctor Who and Godzilla fan br br On balance then this is a good series A little repetitive a little cheesy perhaps but it has elements of greatness Even during the weaker episodes Darren McGavin s wonderful performance as the caustic world weary endlessly funny Kolchak truly shines He carries the series effortlessly in a way that for example Sarah Michelle Gellar never managed on Buffy McGavin was one great character actor and this series is worth watching for him alone
Since was only a toddler when this show originally aired I just recently picked up the DVD set and am wishing there were more episodes filmed This show was a 70s version of the poplular 90 s TV series X Files but with a bit more of a comedic light hearted approach But don t get me wrong some of these episodes have full on horror themes many in which have some pretty greuesome plots left to the imagination of course this was the early 70s television br br Some of the plots where a bit silly as well as the acting but that is the charm and attraction to this series Whether you like mystery crime dramas comedies or sci fi horror themes this series brought all that together Each episode clocked in at around 50 minutes or so 1 hour with commercials and that 50 minutes goes by quick always leaving me wanting more A great classic show that is underrated in my book
If Mulder was looking for his real father here he is Darren McGavin the first X Files pity it was only one season long the producers of this show didn t know that they had the makings of a classic on their hands and in 1993 along came Chris Carter with what i call the follow up to the Night Stalker The X Files Both will go down as classics is my opinion the two shows taking the viewers to a level of experience that only comes along once in a while and who should appear in the X Files years later Darren McGavin as Agent Arthur Dales helping our two favorite hero s solving cases Paying homage to the man i think so well done Chris Carter bringing back a forgotten TV show in the form of David Duchovny as Darren McGavin if it wasn t for watching The X files and that particular show i would have never known about the Night Stalker
I barely remember this show a little but I remembered it was great My eldest brother reminded me about the show recently and I had seen an advertisement for the D V D set coming out The network again screwed up in pulling this from the air so that they could put what else in it s place It should have gone at least 3 seasons Why not right I think sometimes that the network executives think they are the gods of the entertainment world But they mis guess and flat out miss good show placement from time to time Let it be said that they have a lot more flops than hits This was one of the poor decisions to cut from the line up Anyhow I am getting this for my collection
As a forty something urban explorer photography and longtime fan of the original Kolchak Night Stalker series since my early childhood one aspect that hasn t really been mentioned is the amount of urban exploration Carl s character undertook during the series He always managed to get himself in to one great abandonment sewer or tunnel after another Armed with only his trusty penlight okay so he had some flares in the primal ape episode tunnel and his camera he never carried any other gear to either protect himself or make the exploration easier br br Like many here I recently purchased the DVD box set of the two pilot movies and subsequent TV episodes and have been slowly revisiting all the shows And although I remember watching them back in the early 70s when they first aired its been over 30 years passed so many of them seem new all over again Campy dated and cheesy but charming and highly entertaining They just don t make stuff like this these days Now its all regurgitated spin offs with predictable characters and plots br br Thankfully my 16 yr old daughter has been sitting down to watch the episodes with me and has developed an appreciation for them she enjoys the genre It gives me hope and faith the series will carry on to new generations of fans for years to come
Kolchak is sheer entertainment Great stories and a great cast and nothing else to weigh it down Darren McGavin gives an energetic performance that pulls the audience along with him Simon Oakland Jack Grinnage and Ruth McDevitt give McGavin the kind of solid support that most leading actors can only dream of having Some excellent guest stars add colour and verve to individual episodes Erik Estrada in Legacy of Terror Phil Silvers in Horror in the Heights Antonio Fargas in The Zombie It s easy to see how a boyhood spent watching Kolchak drove Chris Carter to create The X Files Darren RIP Simon RIP Ruth RIP
There are two distinct ways to enjoy this snappily written seminal TV show the godfather to X Files and Buffy etc as a monster show it scared the hell out of me when I was a kid or as a well written acted gumshoe film noir It works on both levels The scariness may have been diluted over the years it WAS made in the mid 70s but I was pleasantly surprised upon rediscovering the show via DVD that I actually enjoy it MORE now for the latter reasons The late Darren McGavin IS Karl Kolchak an eccentric tenacious rumpled newsman monster hunter who in pursuit of a story always finds a supernatural angle much to the pain of Kolchak s over stressed put upon boss Tony Vincenzo played with tremendous world weariness by the also late great Simon Oakland you can practically feel the pain of his budding ulcers The interplay between these characters is crackling and witty much like STAR TREK s Spock and McCoy only more acidic Over the course of two pilot TV movies and a one season series Kolchack fought vampires robots werewolves witches zombies government conspiracies aliens and ancient legends sounds like the entire 9 yr run of the X Files In ONE season And Kolchak did it first And as for composer Gil Melle s cool partly whistled main title music well X Files creator Chris Carter calls Mike Snow s very similar X Files main title theme an homage Both themes work well leave it at that And unlike many modern horror sci fi shows most of KOLCHAK s monsters are shown in shadow and in quick cuts effectively and sometimes thankfully as some of them do not hold up to modern scrutiny but some still DO Modern horror shows take note Less IS more One of the few flaws of the show and it s a small one is the over use of sunny California locales passing for windy city Chicago NIGHT GALLERY had the same issue unavoidable for a modest budget L A based show And some of the supporting characters seem to fall into what are now viewed as clich√©s the effeminate reporter Ron Updike always used for comic relief sweet old lady advice columnist Emily But they all DO have their moments to shine UNLIKE many supporting TV characters since clich√© or not KOLCHAK is a timeless show that serves as a template for many that followed And Carl Kolchak is one of the richest characters ever written for a horror genre TV show agent Mulder s REAL dad And as a footnote I tried watching a few episodes of the new re imagining of the show It s an X Files clone a copy of a copy And a bad one at that Carl Kolchak is now a model pretty angsty 30 something played dismally by a boring Stuart Townsend And giving him a Scully type partner is also a lame idea it undermines Kolchak as a lone Don Quixote crusader And Kolchak and Vincenzo GETTING ALONG Where s the tension The interplay That they chose to hang the KOLCHAK name on this regurgitated bit o crap is a prime example of how NOT to do a remake Take a beloved cult series scrape off everything unique about it drain it of all character and color but keep the name Need that cult cred and voil√† Instant re hash It gets an F in Re Imaginings 101 This new version DESERVED the axe Stick with the short lived but classic original It truly gets better with age
A couple of years back I had purchased and enjoyed the MGM double feature DVD of the two Kolchak TV movies THE NIGHT STALKER 1971 and THE NIGHT STRANGLER 1972 When the Universal set of the subsequent TV series came out I had intended to buy it immediately but rumors of playback issues with the dreaded DVD 18s kept me from adding it to my collection recently I placed an online order which consisted of a spate of discounted Universal Box Sets and decided to pick up the KOLCHAK 3 Discer as well br br Having watched it now I can safely say that I didn t regret acquiring this beloved if short lived crime horror series one bit it may follow a standardized formula dogged and resourceful newspaperman Carl Kolchak marvelously played by Darren McGavin gets into everybody s hair with his attitude flustered editor Simon Oakland long suffering colleagues assorted authoritarian figures a plethora of monsters and villains faces up to the inevitable and usually supernatural threat alone but finally is pressured into keeping his story under wraps but a winning one further boosted by an impressive line up of guest stars and notable behind the scenes credits making the show a great deal of fun br br That said quality varies from one episode to another and the modest budgets afforded them results in special and make up effects which sometimes leave a lot to be desired for instance the werewolf in the eponymous entry and the goofy alligator creature in the very last installment not to mention the fact that these were restricted to 50 minute programmes and intended for family consumption to boot rather precludes a simplified and wholesome rendering of its often intriguing psychological and metaphysical themes in the case of the werewolf again he s never seen biting anyone but somewhat foolishly is made to merely throw people around br br While the hero s cynical narration does a lot to pull one into the fanciful plots there s a healthy dose of comedy relief involved in each episode often but not exclusively revolving around McGavin s relationship with either Oakland or geeky reporter Jack Grinnage to say nothing of reasonable atmosphere the setting for the most part is Chicago and suspense To make the ride even more pleasant there s a bouncy score by Gil Melle and Jerry Fielding br br For the record the monsters encountered but not always defeated by Kolchak throughout the series are a revived Jack The Ripper a variety of cults voodoo Native American Aztec aliens vampire werewolf going round its over familiar concept by having this particular episode entirely set on a cruise liner doppelganger Satanist swamp creature mass of electricity robot apeman witch headless motorcyclist succubus a knight s armor taking a murderous life of its own the episode with perhaps the best supporting cast featuring John Dehner as a morose police captain Hans Conried and Robert Emhardt Helen Of Troy and crocodile Some of the actors other than those playing Kolchak s co workers return in the same roles Keenan Wynn and Ramon Bieri both as officers of the law John Fiedler as a shrewd morgue attendant and Richard Kiel as two distinct nemeses of the hero If I were pressed to choose the finest or most entertaining episodes I d lean towards HORROR IN THE HEIGHTS co starring Phil Silvers and Abraham Sofaer and the afore mentioned THE KNIGHTLY MURDERS while as the weakest I d go for THE WEREWOLF due to reasons I ve already explained and CHOPPER based on a story concocted by Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale br br Unfortunately the set contains no extras it would have been nice to see a featurette discussing the numerous concepts dealt with in KOLCHAK THE NIGHT STALKER as well as putting the series into the context of where TV was at the time of its original airing or even denoting the lasting influence it had on the apparently endless run of sci fi series popular today In fact Kolchak himself in a much younger and ostensibly darker guise returned in a 2005 revival this version is available at my local DVD rental outlet but for various reasons I m not sure I d want to check it out so soon after the 1974 5 classic
Kolchak was a TV series that really didn t fit into any category Part horror part comedy some social awareness thrown in and what we have is something that I think people weren t ready for It s a shame really as I ve started to watch these shows on the Chiller network I never saw the originals I realized how different and interesting it really was br br Starring Darren Mcgavin as Kolchak a reporter for the International News Service and Simon Oakland as his always angry boss Tony Vincenzo the show followed the exploits of a Chicago news reporter who more often than not became a part of the story himself as he searched the windy city for modern day creepies that go bump in the night The underlying charm of Macgavin really sets the show apart A somewhat goofy guy who always wears the same suit you cannot help but love him His jokes are great and the back and forth between him and the skeptical editor Oakland are downright hilarious br br The stories are for the most part pretty good and the acting is very good The 70 s were not a great period for special effects and the show suffers for it but if you suspend disbelief what you have is a fun series that was ahead of it s time
I remember the original series vividly mostly due to it s unique blend of wry humor and macabre subject matter Kolchak was hard bitten newsman from the Ben Hecht school of big city reporting and his gritty determination and wise ass demeanor made even the most mundane episode eminently watchable My personal fave was The Spanish Moss Murders due to it s totally original storyline A poor troubled Cajun youth from Louisiana bayou country takes part in a sleep research experiment for the purpose of dream analysis Something goes inexplicably wrong and he literally dreams to life a swamp creature inhabiting the dark folk tales of his youth This malevolent manifestation seeks out all persons who have wronged the dreamer in his conscious state and brutally suffocates them to death Kolchak investigates and uncovers this horrible truth much to the chagrin of police captain Joe Mad Dog Siska wonderfully essayed by a grumpy Keenan Wynn and the head sleep researcher played by Second City improv founder Severn Darden to droll understated perfection The wickedly funny harrowing finale takes place in the Chicago sewer system and is a series highlight Kolchak never got any better Timeless
I d love to give Kolchak a higher rating but the show quickly went from scary suspenseful to silly ABC s fault They moved the show to Friday nights at 8 00 p m then known as the family hour Never should have been on Fridays in the first place I was a sophomore in high school and loved the early episodes It was first up against Police Woman on NBC ABC had huge problems with Friday nights Bad season for them overall until Barney Miller Baretta and SWAT debuted in January of 75 Kolchak should have been a hit Darren McGavin begged to get out of his contract to end the show Too bad the writing wasn t up to Richard Matheson s in the original TV movies Still McGavin made Kolchak his own as actors can do Jackie Gleason as Ralph Kramden and Caroll O Connor as Archie Bunker come to mind That INS set with the manual typewriters and clacking teletypes seems quaint and ancient today yet that was part of the appeal They were very lucky to have Simon Oakland reprise Vincenzo from the TV films
It s a genuine shame that this spin off TV series inspired by the superior made for TV pictures The Night Stalker and The Night Strangler only lasted a single season and twenty episodes because at its best this program offered an often winning and highly entertaining blend of sharp cynical humor Carl Kolchak s spirited verbal sparring matches with perpetually irascible and long suffering editor Tony Vincenzo were always a treat to watch and hear clever writing nifty supernatural menaces gotta love the offbeat and original creatures in The Spanish Moss Murders The Sentry and Horror in the Heights plus you can t go wrong with such tried n true fright favorites as zombies vampires werewolves and witches colorful characters lively acting from a raft of cool guest stars legendary biker flick icon William Smith got a rare chance to tackle a heroic lead in The Energy Eater while other episodes featured great veteran character actors like Keenan Wynn John Fiedler John Dehner Severn Darden and William Daniels in juicy roles effective moments of genuine suspense the sewer set climax of The Spanish Moss Murders in particular was truly harrowing and best of all the one and only Darren McGavin in peak zesty form as the brash aggressive and excitable but basically decent brave and honest small time Chicago Illinois newspaper reporter Carl Kolchak br br Kolchak was the quintessential 70 s everyman protagonist a wily and quick witted fellow with a strong nose for a tasty scoop and an unfortunate knack for getting into all kinds of trouble Moreover the occasionally bumbling Kolchak was anything but superhuman he usually either tripped or stumbled while running away from a deadly threat yet possessed a certain inner strength and courage that enabled him to save the human race time and time again from all kinds of lethal otherworldly foes Kolchak was surrounded by a handful of enjoyable secondary characters Simon Oakland was perfect as Carl s chronically ill tempered boss Tony Vincenzo Jack Grinnage as the prissy Ron Updyke made for an ideal comic foil Ruth McDevitt was simply delightful as the sweet Miss Emily Cowles and Carol Ann Susi was likewise a lot of fun as eager beaver rookie Monique Marmelstein who alas disappeared after popping up in only three episodes Granted the show did suffer from lackluster make up and special effects the titular lycanthrope in The Werewolf unfortunately resembles a Yorkshire terrier and the latter episodes boasted a few laughably silly monsters the headless motorcyclist in Chopper Cathy Lee Crosby as Helen of Troy in The Youth Killer but even the second rate shows are redeemed by the program s trademark wickedly sly sardonic wit and McGavin s boundless vitality and engagingly scrappy presence
I loved KOLCHAK THE NIGHT STALKER since I saw it on the night it premiered on September 13 1974 I loved the monsters which seemed scary at the time and the cool music by Gil Melle hey where s the soundtrack guys and have often thought about what makes this show work for me so completely and have finally concluded that the reason it endures when many others do not is one simple important element it has that almost no other scary show seems to have and that is a main character that most people can relate to on an everyday level When Darren McGavin s Carl Kolchak starts to discover odd situations he reacts like most people would He finds them odd and as he gets closer to danger he is frightened even if he knows he must move forward to try to defeat whichever menace is being showcased in that episode It s rare that he is brave enough to stand up against some superior supernatural force He s usually set a trap and is hiding or waiting in the wings to see if it works Sometimes he seems as surprised that he managed to defeat a foe as we are In one episode he goes to find a monster in a sewer but when he first sees it he runs to get out of there but is trapped so reluctantly he must go back and defend himself He s heroic because he is willing to do things most of us probably wouldn t do but that doesn t mean he probably wouldn t much rather someone else did it instead of him He s a regular guy doing a job trying to make a buck not a monster hunter He just gets wrapped up in things involving the supernatural which he has an interest in but he doesn t want to be hurt or killed anymore than any of the rest of us do If his plan to defeat the creature didn t work you will often see him running for his life to get away from it which is of course what I would do in the situation That s why I was often watching the climax of the shows through my fingers as a kid Kolchak was likable and you cared if something bad happened to him You were scared for him and for the other characters too The producers and writers obviously knew that anyone can create a monster suit scary music and direct a suspenseful scene but it s all for naught if you don t care about the characters Darren McGavin said that the reason why the show only lasted on season was because he got tired of doing a monster of the week show and he decided not to continue I can tell you I mourned when this show was canceled when I was a kid but as an adult I can see why it couldn t go on in that formula for very long I still love the 20 episodes and two movies that starred McGavin as the bumbling determined and brusk but good hearted reporter for the INS known as Carl Kolchak I seriously doubt anyone who makes shows or movies will ever really understand why I loved the show It s not the monsters darkly lit sets creepy music or goofy guest stars although they are all vital ingredients The secret to it s success is right there in the title Kolchak The Night Stalker Without McGavin s lovable bumbling Carl Kolchak to root for and to care for then it just ain t a Night Stalker
Weak scripts at times Yep Cheesy special effects at times Yep Deliciously guilty pleasure most of the time Yep More about Carl Kolchak and Darren McGavin Yep I always enjoyed science fiction as a kid but found so much of the Dracula Frankenstein Mummy horror stuff as just so much crap It took Abbott and Costello to give me a new perspective on the classic Universal monsters and it took Carl Kolchak to win me over to the dark side of entertainment The Duke had Rooster Cogburn Eastwood had Dirty Harry Garner had Maverick and Rockford Selleck had Magnum and Darren McGavin had Carl Kolchak Mixed in with all those weak scripts cheesy special effects that baroque group of supporting characters and actors and guest stars there was Darren McGavin as Carl Kolchak He had a wry sense of humor in spite of the danger was an idealist in his pursuit of the truth and a realist when it came to accepting the obligatory incompetence and eventual cover up by government officials Additionally unlike 98 of us Kolchak was willing to stick his neck out and do what needed to be done even if it meant his demise the end of his journalistic career or jail time For all his faults including no taste in clothes Carl Kolchak was a man of charm and wit who drove a beautiful classic yellow Mustang which was an old used car at the time on his way to save the day for humanity As good as any other fictional hero Carl Kolchak was the everyman hero brought to life every week for one season thanks to Darren McGavin Now that he s passed on and his show is on DVD I hope he s having as much fun watching me watch him have fun playing Kolchak The Night Stalker all over again
When originally screened in America in 1972 The Night Stalker became the highest rated made for T V movie in history Based on Jeff Rice s unpublished novel it told how a fearless investigative reporter named Carl Kolchak the late Darren McGavin discovered the existence of a vampire in modern day Las Vegas When it arrived on British television four years later it did not quite have the same impact but my friends were talking about it at school on Monday morning as indeed was I We all agreed that it was one of the most exciting things we had seen br br I did not know of the existence of The Night Strangler until it turned up nearly a decade later I T V who screened the Kolchak movies had apparently decided to pass on the spin off series they felt Barnaby Jones starring Buddy Ebsen to be more of a draw and anyway viewers might confuse Kolchak with Kojak For years my only source of information concerning the show was an article in Fangoria magazine I could not even purchase the Jeff Rice novels br br Then something wonderful happened In 1990 B B C 2 put out the show as part of a late night Friday series devoted to the supernatural called Mystery Train hosted by Richard O Brian Kolchak found himself rubbing shoulders with the likes of The Brain Eaters and Earth Vs The Spider The opening titles were trimmed removing Kolchak s whistling and the closing credits well there were none br br The first episode screened was Werewolf I cannot say I was overly impressed but stuck with it and am I glad that I did br br I really wish I d seen it in 1974 My twelve year old self would have adored it Creepy humorous exciting no wonder it fired Chris Carter s imagination br br The show s biggest asset was of course McGavin Unlike the recent Kolchak the original was an everyman figure eccentrically dressed rather conservative He was to the supernatural what Columbo was to crime The late Simon Oakland was great too as Kolchak s bad tempered boss Tony Vincenzo The scripts overflowed with wonderful dry wit I found myself enjoying the programme more for the humour content than the horror When the twenty episodes ended I felt bereft br br The X Files came along a few years later and filled the void but only to an extent I wanted Kolchak and Vincenzo back I am glad that the show was never revived though Without Oakland it would not have been the same br br I have the Rice books now and have read them several times I was very surprised when Stephen King slated the first in his book Danse Macabre as it is as good as anything he has written br br Alright so some of the monsters were hardly state of the art but so what The new Kolchak totally missed the point of the original What you don t see is sometimes more frightening than what you do br br Best Episode Horror In The Heights Worst Episode The Sentry
One of my favorite shows back in the 70s As I recall it went to air on Friday or possibly Saturday night on the Nine Network here in Australia Darren McGavin and Simon Oakland were great together br br Each episode usually reached a climax with Kolchack having to engage in hand to hand combat with some sort of supernatural opponent To their credit the writers made a concerted effort to get away from the usual round of vampires and ghosts as much as possible br br I remember one episode in which the adversary was the spirit of an ancient Indian Chief which who came back as a massive electrical current which started to kill people in a city hospital The final showdown saw Kolchack trying to short circuit the power beast amidst an explosion of sparks and billowing flames Oh well you had to be there at the time but it was an interesting idea br br McGavin always packed a lot of energy and enthusiasm into his roles and this was one of his best br br Definitely deserves a place in TV s Hall of Fame To quote Tony Vincenzo Kolchack you are ON IT Or in the case of the Hall of Fame IN it
Not the most successful television project John Cleese ever did Strange Case has the feel of a first draft that was rushed into production before any revisions could be made There are some silly ideas throughout and even a few clever ones but the story as a whole unfortunately doesn t add up to much br br Arthur Lowe is a hoot though as Dr Watson bionic bits and all Good Lord
It has been so many years since I saw this but I do feel compelled to defend this gem against those who lambast it br br It is interesting and unusual to observe the diversity of opinion here That is what humour does I suppose It is subjective It either charges through your funny bone at 60 000 volts or it leaves you cold and wondering why you gave it the time br br This show has some of Britain s best comic actors put together in a story that is silly and irreverent and the outcome is hilarious The dialogue and visual comedy is beautifully delivered and the two leads Cleese and Lowe are superb together This was made for them br br I can t really say anymore other than to implore you to find this and watch it You won t be disappointed and in a world devoid of genteel humour this is a classic inane and harmless piece of comedic brilliance
I m not a John Cleese completist although I thought Fawlty Towers was brilliant but I am a fan and when I saw this sitting neglected on a shelf at my local Blockbuster I decided to give it a try What I got was a wonderful surprise and one of the funniest 50 minute viewing experiences I ve ever had The writing is typical English goon show schtick In fact as an audio skit this wouldn t be out of place on a Firesign Theater album But the execution and timing is spot on and this elevates Strange Case into the kind of jaw dropping performance that can create lifelong British comedy fanatics br br The Brits have a gift for combining broadly satirical lampoons with closely observed tics of character and timing and the creators use both to good effect here Cleese s portrayal of Holmes seems to owe much to the Arkin s and Seller s Inspector Clouseau however Cleese has such a knack for physical comedy that he more than holds his own But the unexpected treat here is Arthur Lowe who plays Watson as an genial but invincibly uncomprehending imbecile with such superb timing and delivery that he becomes the best aspect of the film I d never heard of Lowe before this his background seems to be vaudeville and musical theater but he justifies his entire career with this performance as far as I m concerned br br Some people might not care for Strange Case especially if British whimsy isn t their cuppa tea But I am extremely glad I got to see this before it vanished from sight
If you enjoy Cleese all the British Pythonesque humour of the time then this little gem is absolutely hilarious br br Arthur Lowe is a real treat br br I saw this with friends on TV when it first came out and its classic quotes have formed a part of our jokes for 30 years and will do forever I have it on tape and it is continually appreciated br br Perhaps some reviewers are taking it too seriously br br I can t believe it is now only available in the US NTSC of course and not in UK where it should be an essential part of the history of British humour
You can do a lot with a little cash Blair Witch proved that This film supports it It is no more than a sitcom in length and complexity However because it has John Cleese as Sherlock Holmes it manages to be hilarious even on a budget that couldn t afford a shoestring The highlight of this film is Arthur Lowe as the sincere bumbling Watson his dimness and slowness foils Cleese s quick tempered wit If you ever run across the film watch it for a quirky laugh or two
The only reason that I did not give this 10 stars was the DVD format no menus extras etc However if you have ever had a dream to do something with your life this film is for you If you believe in yourself and your dream do not let anyone or anything stop you This is one of the most life affirming films that I have ever seen And magical The acting is superb the plot serves the purpose and the opening sequence is fantastic This is one of those films that cult status used to be about I have recommended this film to all of my friends Some love it some can t finish it Whenever I think or feel that something is impossible I think about Alan Arkin s role in this film Sure wish he d make more films
The quintessential road movie if your idea of a road movie involves three would be magicians with Eastern European accents and Claire Forlani Well one out of four ain t bad A no talent magician with an eye for showmanship Max watches a very skilled pickpocket Hugo plying his trade in New York After convincing Hugo that he Max is a mental and b desperately in need of a partner to make his dreams of being a stage magician come alive the not so dynamic duo enlist the managerial expertise of an inventor of illusions Milo and the ah gentler attributes of a lovely waitress Lydia The unlikely four pile into a van obtained by Hugo you guess where it came from and head to Vegas Havoc ensues Anyhow it s funny it s well written and the ending is surprisingly good A solid comedy with a warm heart and all the better that it was totally unexpected
Magicians is a wonderful ride from start to finish thanks in large part to the magic that is generated by the stars Alan Arkin is fantastic in one of his best roles in decades Like any really fine film it s a journey in which the theme is redemption and the results of dreaming I can t believe this film is SO difficult to find I d buy it on DVD in a heartbeat but have yet to find an outlet
I have wanted to see this for the longest time James Merendino is a great director SLC Punk is one of my favorite movies and in the first ten minutes of this film I thought that it was a great follow up after that though it begins to drag The acting and direction were terrific In fact everything in the film seemed to flow except for the script At times the only thing keeping my attention was the fact that in the cast was the most beautiful woman in the world Claire Forlani This film was good but I expected more br br P S Look for great cameos by Chi McBride and Chris McDonald
This is one of the funniest movies I have seen I watched it on DVD and the disc does not have any special features or even a menu but that is not necessarily what I care about br br I tend to judge movies on a case by case basis depending on among other things if it is a big studio production or a smaller film This is a smaller film and I am willing to forgive minor things That said I believe it has one of the most imaginative and original title sequences that I have seen br br I enjoyed the acting of all of the major players I especially enjoyed Til Schweiger and Alan Arkin Alan Arkin has most of the funniest lines The character portrayed by Claire Forlani might come across as unrealistic to some people but I have personally known real people with emotional problems that very readily look at life s decisions as her character does That helped me pick up the nuances where her hurts could come out through the veneer of her humor br br This is not a movie for children obviously but it does NOT engage in gratuitous sex and nudity There is quite a bit of adult language though but it can sometimes be very funny In particular Alan Arkin s character who can t even swear correctly br br Also watch for the cameos from known character actors
This is a quirky little movie and I have to agree that there is some quirky acting in it as well br br It follows the adventures of a young man who decides that he wants to become a famous Las Vegas illusionist and is partly about following his dream partly about the dreams of others and all about the travails of showbiz I thought the movie was charming and it has a moment or two of real magic that make the whole thing worthwhile br br Alan Arkin is terrific as the magician who never was and his mentoring of Max makes for a funny and touching relationship br br Not for everyone probably but if you like movies about the journey then I think you ll like this one
This movie is awesome for three main reasons It is esthetically beautiful I absolutely loved that There is a bold color theme throughout the movie with extraordinary costumes and picturesque sets A photography which looks very costly and probably was not completes the look I always enjoy those stories about groups of misfits loners coming together and becoming a family Sometimes they fall into clich√©s but this one does not This group of actors really portrays well flawed yet extremely likable characters Alan Larkin is the best between him the van and the road movie theme I could not help but remember my favorite movie of last year Little Miss Sunshine I discovered Fabrizio Bentivoglio very interesting actor and just got annoyed a tiny little bit by Til Schweiger performance at times The opening scene all the scenes where they mess up their tricks are very funny There is a mix of humor and emotion throughout the film I like the end a lot And of course it is all about the Magician theme A good magician is making the audience look where he wants them to to create an illusion Which happens to be exactly what a movie director does and that s why they call it movie magic
I rented this movie from blockbuster on a whim i like alan arkin and the cover was catching i read the back and knew right away it was going to either be the best or the worst movie i have ever seen i guess i got lucky i laughed from beginning to end alan arkin brings a great character to this movie i have since bought a used rental copy for my own collection and watch it all the time i have recommeded this movie to loads of people and they all enjoyed it as much as i did i see complaints about the menus and dvd functions but it doesn t take away from the movie the disk was authored for Blockbuster exculsivley which is why they didn t allow you to skip past the previews aside from that you shouldn t let the functions of the DVD to deterr you from watching the excellent film
Miriam Hopkins is The Lady with Red Hair in this 1940 biopic of Mrs Leslie Carter which also stars Claude Rains as David Belasco Richard Ainley as Lou Payne and a fine cast of supporting players including Laura Hope Crews and Victor Jory br br Miriam Hopkins and Claude Rains give wonderful performances Hopkins was a beautiful actress who really makes us feel for Mrs Carter Rains is great as the flamboyant egotistical producer writer actor impresario David Belasco one of the great names in theater br br Though Mrs Carter s second husband Lou Payne served as adviser on this film it s a poor representation of the real events of Mrs Carter s life True there was a much publicized and bitter divorce and she was undoubtedly viewed as a scandalous character for that and for becoming an actress However she had custody of her son Dudley so there was no custody battle Once she broke with Belasco she did not go back to him and in fact started working in vaudeville and actually made some films toward the end of her life She did indeed marry Lou and he became her leading man in many productions br br The driving force for Mrs Carter in the beginning of this film is regaining custody of her son but she finally realizes that in her time away from him he is thoroughly bonded with his father In the film also and I m not sure if it was true in real life she traveled with her mother and lived in a theatrical boarding house which gives the film some added interesting atmosphere br br Not a bad movie probably not a depiction of the greatness of either Carter or Belasco One of Mrs Carter s most famous moments was in The Heart of Maryland where she wore a wig with six foot tresses Off stage fans blew her hair as she hung 35 feet above the stage clutching the center of a bell to keep it from ringing Quite a visual
I had seen Lady with Red Hair back when it appeared and didn t remember it as something to cherish The truth is that notwithstanding its base in a true story its screen play is silly and unbelievable The real merit of the picture is the cast A constellation of some of the best supporting players of the 30 s and 40 s make a background for the delicate intelligent work of the always underrated Miriam Hopkins and the wonderful spectacular performance of Claude Rains who as usual is the best thing in the picture What an actor He never won an Oscar but he is in the good company of Chaplin Garbo and Hitchcock Perhaps Lady with Red Hair contains his best work in films See it and enjoy him br br
As a biographical film The Lady With Red Hair the story of how director producer playwright David Belasco transformed notorious society divorcee Mrs Leslie Carter into an international stage star is certainly not in a league with that other Warner s biopic of similar vintage Yankee Doodle Dandy what is but Lady is an enjoyable film in its own right AND shares quite a few traits in common with the Cagney classic br br Like Yankee Doodle Dandy The Lady With Red Hair brims over with old time show business flavor Among other things both films feature delicious theatrical boarding house sequences as well as the inevitable scenes set backstage and in theatrical managers offices Also in Lady as in the Cohan biopic the supporting cast is made up of familiar and beloved character actors of the period all doing the sort of top notch work we remember them for br br Need I add that again like Yankee Doodle Dandy The Lady With Red Hair doesn t let the truth get in the way of telling a good story But also like Dandy Lady does manage gloriously to convey the esssence of its show business giant hero s larger than life personality Everyone knows that Cagney limned Cohan for all time in his brilliant and affectionate portrayal in Yankee Doodle Dandy but few moviegoers realize that Claude Rains did a similar service for David Belasco in The Lady With Red Hair and did it with a panache that almost equals Cagney s br br Rains as Belasco perfectly captures that legendary showman s galvanic personality in all its outsized glory Rains gives a tremendously enjoyable superbly observed and remarkably true to life performance as the man all Broadway once called The Wizard To watch Claude Rains in action looking in every shot as if he s having a helluva good time in The Lady With Red Hair is to see David Belasco leap to life on film as if he can t wait to shake things up on the Main Stem once again br br
A group of friends decide to take a camping trip into the desert and find themselves stalked and murdered by a mysterious killer in a black pick up truck Mirage is obviously inspired by Spielberg s Duel and Craven s The Hills Have Eyes Still this slasher yarn offers plenty of nasty violence and gore The film s gory highlight is a sequence involving a man having his arm and leg chained together around a tree and then having his limbs dismembered when the chain is pulled by a truck There is also a little bit of suspense and some exciting stalk and slash sequences The acting is pretty lame and the script is quite weak but the film is fast paced and shocking B G Steers who plays the villain is fairly threatening The desert locations provide some atmosphere and the gore is rather strong Overall if you like low budget horror films give this one a look 8 out of 10
I remember that i was a child when i first saw this movie it was my first horror movie maybe that s the reason why i can still remember some parts of it I don t remember much about acting nude scenes or other things but i do remember a male has head blown up with a grenade a male dismembered over a tree and a male run down by truck and shot in head Todd Schaefer Kenny Johnson and Kevin McParland I also remember the last scene when Jennifer McAllister riped of the killer stomach to get the keys of the truck It s a movie that gives you the creep and it s worth a look But where do i find it How can i download it
Well this was one of those films I caught on the off chance and it was good enough for me to record when it showed up next time If like myself you enjoy many 80 s horror flicks that branched out a little from the norm i e not just another glut of generic sequels then I think you may enjoy this When the bad guy eventually turns up in person he was definitely not what I expected to see All in all I wouldn t go out of your way for this one but if you like the genre then watch it if it comes up and you have an hour and a half to kill I guess I d give it 6 5 out of 10
This movie which starts out with a interesting opening of two hot blondes getting it on in the back of a driver less moving vehicle has quite the quirky little personality to boot The cast of seven although one girl doesn t hang around for the bodycount which is unfortunate because the death toll is already so small as is are all super hot as our story centers around teens partying way out in the desert an odd but effective choice of setting who are hunted down by a creepy man in black gloves and jeans who drives a black truck It predates many of the vehicle inspired slashers to date The Trip Joy Ride Jeepers Creepers where the killer s vehicle itself becomes an evil antagonist The killer himself is quite creepy and we find solace in the extremely likable heroine in Jennifer McAllister look at the interesting symbolic contrast of the evil killer in all black while our benevolent heroine sports all white attire as scanty and stonewashed as it may be Director Bill Crain does some really great things with his camera some neat tricks on screen and the cast tries their absolute best There s enough gore in the low bodycount to please the gore fans and enough T A from a couple of the girls to please T A fans Overall this flick is highly underrated and widely sought out in the slasher movie world as it s proved quite rare to find on video Highly recommended
Mirage 1990 is a very rare horror chiller from 1990 released here in the UK on the New World Video label br br It s a desert based horror film about a group of young friends who are partying for the weekend only to be killed off one by one by an unknown force who drives a menacing black truck This film has some creepy scenes and some gore here and there but i have to say that the acting was so lame even by low budget standards But the film was oddly addictive and i liked it and i never fell asleep or turned it off which is always a good sign I nearly gave this movie 6 10 but seeing as it built up steam along the way had some good moments of gore and suspense had some good nudity and the fact that the blonde in the main female role was a hottie too i ll give it 7 10
Bill Crain s rarer than rare slasher movie certainly doesn t follow the standard stalk and slash guidelines that have become so essential of its counterparts The bogeyman this time around uses grenades and small arms as well as an awesome array of melee weapons a sin that s virtually unacceptable in most post Halloween genre pieces But there s still just enough familiarity to keep slasher buffs from checking the rule book and the plot never strays too far from the path that you ve grown to expect Just as Wally Koz s surprisingly decent 555 was seemingly put together with help from various members of his family Mirage seems to have been a joint production from relatives of the director Looking through the credits I noticed numerous Crains listed in key positions throughout the construction of the feature But despite fairly good distribution across the globe the movie failed to make an impression either side of the Atlantic and now it has become pretty much a phantom of the VHS market Nevertheless this only made it appeal to me even more and so I strained my resources to track a copy down br br It all takes place in the middle of the dessert which as I m sure you ll agree is hardly the most exciting location With that said though I must admit that there s certainly going to be no chance of any nosey John Q Laws turning up unexpectedly Four undeniably beautiful youngsters head out into the sand for a night of debauchery and frolics that always seems to rub homicidal maniacs the wrong way Chris Jennifer McAllister and her boyfriend Greg Kenny Johnson meet up with amusing new age hippies Trip Kevin McParland and Mary Nicole Anton at a make shift camp site in the midst of the dune like wilderness Greg s older brother Kyle Todd Schaefer and his buxom girlfriend Bambi Laura Albert soon turn up to join the body count applicants in their quest for an early grave Kyle used to date Chris before his younger brother took the liberty of stealing his squeeze something that Kyle doesn t seem too keen to forget Sound like a motive for a massacre Well what did you expect Before long an unseen someone driving a truck with tinted windows joins the gathering with a unique set of tricks up his sleeve Will any of the kids survive to turn up for a sequel br br I have had trouble tracking down any information at all about this feature I don t even know if director Bill Crain is aka William Crain the man behind Midnight Fear and Blacula among others Mirage certainly doesn t appear on his official filmography so your guess is as good as mine Judging by the credible work behind the camera I d have to say that I find it hard to believe that this is the debut of a man with no previous cinematic experience The film is stylishly photographed with some superb work from DP Michael Crain and the director boasts a credible talent for building suspense when it s necessary R Christopher Biggs gore FX are imaginatively created and gruesome and kudos to the sleepy head over at the BBFC who inexplicably let this pass through UNCUT on a usually stringent 18 rating A couple of the murders are indeed extremely macabre One guy gets buried up to his neck in sand before coming face to face with a grenade while another ends up literally legless after loosing a battle with a chain and a pick up truck There s also some black humor that s surely unintentional We spend the majority of the feature seeing only the killer s boots as he steps out of his vehicle and stalks the youngsters But when he s revealed to hilariously resemble Keanu Reeves circa Bill and Ted s Bogus Journey I didn t quite know what to expect Thankfully Crain knows exactly how to keep things creepy and the showdown is particularly mean spirited as the psycho taunts Chris sadistically br br There are some surprisingly good performances on display from an extremely inexperienced cast The divine Jennifer McAllister does a superb job as the heroine and B G Steers portrays off his rocker dementia with finesse The Casting director chose wisely to pick some of the most beautiful females ever slaughtered in slasher cinema and it gratefully doesn t come at the cost of thespian potential The soundtrack works well to build the desolate atmosphere of isolation which is carefully handled by a director that should have been signed and nurtured by Hollywood bigwigs Watch out for the superb nightmare sequence that is truly horror film making at it s freakiest br br Mirage is a good late entry to the cycle that was somewhat unfortunate to miss a boom year placing amongst the slasher elite When you consider that this was made with just a cast of seven and a pick up truck you have to say that they did a damn good job The flaws are numerous but never detract

It s hard to watch this movie without thinking forward to the television show it would become especially if like me you happen to like the TV show more But there s a lot to be said for the source br br Oscar Madison Walter Matthau is a top New York City sportswriter who lives in an eight room apartment by himself a casualty of divorce and his own stubbornly sloppy mindset Enter his friend Felix Ungar Jack Lemmon needing a place to live after his wife threw him out for his stubbornly neatnik mindset The result is a train wreck and one of the most beloved movie adaptations of a Neil Simon stage play br br First thing s first I love that apartment Poker table novelty dart board askew photos of baseball players empty booze and beer containers even a pair of Roman columns It s a place where men can be boys Simon and director Gene Saks do a great job opening up the stage play s single set Oscar s living room by moving the action into the bedrooms and kitchen and giving the mounting tension between Oscar and Felix more corners to bounce off of br br Neal Hefti s familiar score was heard on the TV show but never so sweepingly orchestrated as it is here in several different arrangements that make the on screen action soar whenever its played Real location work and night shots of Manhattan give the film an energy common to films shot in that place and time Buddwing The World Of Henry Orient Midnight Cowboy Manchurian Candidate Rosemary s Baby etc br br Are Lemmon and Matthau too heavy in comparison to Tony Randall and Jack Klugman To be fair the movie is meant to be a more serious affair dealing with the then uncommon condition of mid life divorce and the frustration inherent in not being able to make a relationship work Simon has more in mind than entering Felix and Oscar in a game of Password or a battle of wits with Howard Cosell But I don t know br br Both Lemmon and Matthau were terrific comedians I enjoy watching especially in the middle of this film as I often do in their separate movies but I never understood why they were regarded as a great comedy team Here in their best regarded partnership they seem to be acting in two different films Lemmon in a comedy drama and Matthau in a farce Matthau is great in the beginning charming us with his teddy bear demeanor around the poker table but near the end of the film he takes a turn much like Jack Torrance s in The Shining reacting to Felix cleaning up his apartment and serving tasty food to his friends in a way that totally upsets the delicate balance of blame br br While the ending bothers me the part many see as the most jarring the beginning works fine as I see it Watching Felix stumbling around trying to kill himself isn t great comedy no but it s a good way to get into a great comedy setting us up with some real life pain before bringing in the warmth and laughter Plus it has some great shots of the seedier parts of the city In the middle of the movie this scene would have been a miscalculation but it works as a way of establishing Felix s torment and a sense of sharp relief to come when we see Oscar and his poker friends bicker and feud br br That s where Simon s lines are so great They are the underlying strength of the film He gets the banter exactly right and real and still makes it funny I don t mind you talking Felix You got things to say What s scaring me is I m beginning to listen The TV show showed how wrong it is to assume the movie is always better in fact the TV show once made a good point about assuming anything at all but the movie makes for a solid foundation and is a joy in its own right
Neil Simon had a knack for dialog and nowhere is this more evident than the lines he gives WALTER MATTHAU and JACK LEMMON as opposite types in THE ODD COUPLE a mixture of comedy and sadness that depends entirely on the believability of two such mismatched friends sharing an apartment br br Lemmon is neatnik Felix Ungar bent on suicide after the divorce from his wife and reluctantly agreeing to share an apartment with Oscar Madison Matthau with somewhat disastrous results Seems that everything Felix says and does drives Oscar up the wall and neither one can stand the other s ways with Oscar being the messiest male imaginable and Felix the exact opposite br br Funniest scene for me was when the giggling Pigeon sisters in the apartment above visit them on a dinner date The priceless interaction between Lemmon Matthau and Carole Shelley and Monica Evans is enough to put you in stitches The talented Pigeon sisters are the gals who did the voices for the Gabble Sisters a pair of geese in Disney s THE ARISTOCATS and here their comic timing on top of Lemmon s sad story of despair is enough to spin the film into hilarity where it remains much of the time br br If you re a Neil Simon fan and have enjoyed other screen treatments of his work this one is not to be missed Matthau and Lemmon are perfectly cast even though they considered exchanging roles before filming began and of course it s easy to see why it became a top rated TV show later on br br Summing up Top Simon comedy not to be missed
Felix Unger Jack Lemmon has just been dumped by his wife because he is one of the most annoying neurotic people in the world Suicide is his way out but he just can t seem to get it to work so he heads over to his friends house Oscar Madison Walther Matthau is also recently divorced and living it up in bachelor heaven Smoking gambling hitting on chicks eating out and never cleaning is paradise to him Well with the suicide attempts Oscar decides to let Felix move in At first it is a match made in heaven Felix cooks and cleans and helps Oscar pay his alimony on time but soon Oscar is jonesing for women and Felix who in today s world would probably be gay isn t ready to move on They invite a couple of British birds over and they find Felix so tender that soon they and Felix are weeping and chatting about his family life leaving Oscar denied This is it he explodes and throws him out but Felix isn t as helpless as it seems and soon he has the upper hand My favorite quote You leave me little notes on my pillow Told you 158 times I can t stand little notes on my pillow We re all out of cornflakes F U Took me three hours to figure out F U was Felix Ungar Based on a Neil Simon play who also wrote the screenplay this has a certain theatre feel to it Set and the repartee and looks feel quite play like for better or worse Lemmon and Mathau have excellent comedic chemistry and have appeared in the Grumpier Old Men movies and Out to Sea reprising the same finicky slob roles but with different names to avoid royalty issues I m sure br br This movie is like strawberries dipped in chocolate The chocolate is smooth sweet and rich the strawberry is tart juicy and bright red unless you get those nasty greenish ones They are almost polar opposites but together the contrasts highlight each other and make a wonderful dessert 7 10 br br http blog myspace com locoformovies
THE ODD COUPLE is the classic film version of Neil Simon s most famous play about a TV newswriter named Felix Unger who is an obsessive neat freak who moves in with his divorced best friend Oscar Madison a sportswriter and complete slob after his wife Frances throws him out of their apartment Already divorced Oscar takes his best friend in and regrets it from the moment he does it Neil Simon s classic comedy first came to Broadway with Art Carney playing Felix and Walter Matthau playing Oscar Jack Lemmon takes over for Carney in the film version with a memorable performance as Felix Unger Lemmon is not only terribly funny in the role but so vividly real that he brings an element of melancholy to the pitiful figure that is Felix Unger Matthau fortunately was allowed to recreate his role as Oscar a one of a kind gem of comic performance that provides consistent laughs throughout This teaming of Lemmon and Matthau turned out to be comic gold that was re visited in nine other films With both of these actors no longer with us the viewing of this classic becomes more touching but no less hilarious Simon s play has been nicely expanded for the screen with a silent prologue chronicling a depressed Felix s suicide attempt that is a winner The supporting cast includes Herb Edelman John Fiedler Larry Haines and David Sheiner as Oscar s poker playing buddies and Moncia Evans and Carole Shelley as the Piedgon Sisters blind dates of Oscar and Felix Of course it later became an excellent TV series with Tony Randall and Jack Klugman but there s nothing like the original A joy from start to finish
This is the Neil Simon piece of work that got a lot of praises The Odd Couple is a one of a kind gem that lingers within You got Felix Ungar Jack Lemmon a hypochondriac fussy neat freak and a big thorn in the side of his roommate Oscar Madison Walter Matthau a total slob These men have great jobs though Felix is a news writer and Oscar is a sports writer Both of these men are divorced Felix s wife is nearby while Oscar s is on the other side of the U S The West Coast Well what can you say Two men living in one roof together without driving each other crazy is impossible as well as improbable It s a whole lot of laughs and a whole lot of fun I liked the part where when those two British neighbors that speak to both gentlemen and after Oscar kicked out Felix he gets lucky and lives with them when he refused to have dinner with them the night earlier It s about time that Felix needed to lighten up I guess all neat freaks neat to lighten up They can be fussy yet they should be patient as well A very fun movie and a nuevo classic Neil Simon s The Odd Couple is a must see classic movie 5 STARS
Matthau and Lemmon are at their very best in this one everyone else in the movie are also great The Dialogue is excellent and very very witty and the scene where Lemmon s character attempts to clear out his sinuses in a restaurant have me rolling on the floor with laughter every time I see it Anyone who happened to see the not so great sequel should not be turned away from the original I recommend this wonderful movie to everyone I just love it And the fact the Jack Lemmon plays his character so straight forward with tragic overtones only adds to the hilariousness in my opinion These two great guys made a string of movies together but this one is the best no doubt
The first time I saw this I didn t laugh too much At the time I was only about fifteen years old and thought that maybe some of the deeper humor was too mature for me to understand at the time I had the same reaction when I viewed it a second time a few months ago and this time it was because Felix s aborted suicide attempt at the beginning of the movie kind of darkened the movie a bit This scene made some of the things Oscar said and did to Felix later in the movie seem needlessly cruel and their personality clashes weren t as amusing as they could have been Had I not already known the story I would have been worried that some of Oscar s antics to Felix might push him over the edge As it was it didn t make me laugh or smile like the television show with Jack Klugman and Tony Randall did Still all in all a pretty good movie and it spawned one of the greatest sitcoms on television 7 out of 10
Neil Simon has quite a body of work but it is the Odd Couple that carried him to fame This film really works Jack Lemmon Walter Matthaw have a great chemistry The supporting cast for this film is stellar as well br br It is about 2 men living together who are from opposite planets The script bristles with humor from this situation This had been done in some forms previously This is the one that brings it all together in a very good package br br Simon has done some other decent work but this one is really his best work which made the rest of his work possible It is hard to imagine Simon ever topping this
Some of the best movies that are categorized as comedies actually blur between comedy and drama The Graduate and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid which were made also in the late 1960 s are perfect examples Are they comedies with dramatic undertones or dramas with a lot of humor In many respects The Odd Couple falls into this same category of being both comedy yet highly dramatic with deep underpinnings about human nature Much of what happens may be funny to the audience but the characters are not laughing br br Despite the rather light hearted TV show of the 1970 s the original Odd Couple is not merely about a neat guy and messy guy who are forced to live together because of their marital situation It s really about two opposites who must face why their marriages fell apart and how their detrimental idiosyncrasies reveal themselves outside of their marriage Neatness the characteristic of Felix Ungar Jack Lemon perfectly cast and messiness the characteristic of Oscar Madison Walter Matthau are only the beginning and somewhat superficial As the story unfolds we find there is a lot more to these men than simply neatness versus messiness br br Briefly the story is really about Felix Ungar who has to face an impending divorce from his wife Francis who we never meet but is an important character throughout the story On the verge of suicide Ungar goes to the only place he knows the apartment of Oscar Madison where a group of poker buddies hang out every so often We learn that Ungar is not only a member of this poker club but the group knows what s happening to him and try in their inept way to help out Madison figures the best way to help Ungar is to let him move in with him until his suicidal tendencies wear off br br Unfortunately for Madison he doesn t know what he s getting himself into Madison is a carefree happy go lucky if rather irresponsible slob who s refrigerator was last cleaned probably when Herbert Hoover was still in the White House Madison s idea of serving snacks is grabbing moldy cheese and sticking them in between two pieces of bread and then throwing the contents of a bag of chips on the table On the other hand he enjoys booze and women in short having a good time br br Ungar is not only altogether different he is diametrically opposite He is not only an obsessive neatness nut that finds more joy in disinfecting the apartment than meeting women but he knows more than most women do about cooking and fine eating At one point he calls his ex wife not to talk about reconciling but to get her recipe for meatloaf At another moment Ungar was going to spend the rest of the evening cutting cabbage for coleslaw When Madison seems unimpressed Ungar finally confesses he was only doing it for his roommate because he can t stand coleslaw Who is this guy But he has another endearing trait Felix is also a hypochondriac He obsesses about his health to the point where he makes strange noises in public places claiming he s helping his sinuses He seems to have every health condition in the book And if they made up more Felix would probably have them Ultimately he is overly self absorbed br br Running throughout the movie are references to marriage At one point when Madison is trying to convince Ungar to move in he says What do you want a wedding ring But little does he know that it is not the neat guy who can t deal with the messy guy but the other way around Their friendship becomes an inadvertent hellish relationship And the climax occurs when Oscar invites two lonely British sisters for a get together with both comedic and tragic results This is one of the best comedies of its type ever written and not to be missed with superlative performances by Walter Matthau and Jack Lemon in roles that are hard to imagine better played by anyone else It is unfortunate that writing of this caliber is sadly lacking from most comedies being produced today
The original movie The Odd Couple has some wonderful comic one liners The entire world it seems knows the story of neurotic neat freak Felix Ungar and funny obnoxious slob Oscar Madison This paring of mismatched roommates created one of the most successful TV series of all time as well as countless not anywhere near as good imitations br br The Odd Couple movie has some wonderful jokes about Oscar s apartment and his sloppy habits He says Who wants food One of his poker player buddies asks What do ya got Oscar says I got brown sandwiches and green sandwiches What s the brown It s either very new cheese or very old meat I also love the line about Oscar s refrigerator It s been out of order for two weeks I saw milk standing in there that wasn t even in a bottle There is no question that Walter Matthau s Oscar Madison is a joy to watch on screen He s almost as good as Jack Klugman s version in the TV series br br The problem with the movie is Jack Lemmon s Felix Ungar Jack makes a very very honest effort at the role The problem is that he makes Felix SO depressing and down trodden that he becomes more annoying than comical Tony Randall s performance in the series brought the kind of humor warmth and sensitivity to Felix s character which Lemmon s portrayal lacks Tony s Felix Unger obviously could be annoying some of the time However in the TV series it related to specific situations where the annoyance was needed in the storyline Jack s Felix Ungar note the different spelling in the movie seems to never be happy fun or interesting The movie Felix Ungar is a roommate that drives you up the wall all the time br br The movie still has great moments that withstand the test of time the famous meatloaf fight is one of the greatest scenes ever One of the other great examples of Felix s little notes on Oscar s pillow will be remembered forever However there are some darker sides where Oscar goes over the top His crying near the end after bawling out Felix and a scene involving Felix s Linguine dinner although lightened by a funny line seem more depressing than comical br br Perhaps there wasn t enough time to see the lighter side of these characters that made the series so memorable in the movie The beginning 20 minutes are very boring The same issue occurs with Felix s conversation with the Pidgeon Sisters The movie s ending is predictable and too pat There s very little care or compassion for each of them by the other The result is that the darker side of the film leads to a lot of depression and anger rather than comedy unless you are watching the great scenes described above It appears that Jack Lemmon s monotone persona of Felix brings the film down rather than enhances or embraces the comedy between the characters br br It really took the 1970 s TV series to make The Odd Couple the best that it could be The original film is still very good However the TV series is much better
First ever viewing July 21 2008 br br Very impressive screenplay and comedic acting and timing in this film Now 40 years old it has lost none of it s power Neil Simon displays excellent insight into human nature and relationships as well as how to create genuine comedy from unusual situations Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau give great comedic performances Neil Simon was inspired by actual events in his own life to write the play this film is based on br br One of the best written and acted Hollywood comedies of all time br br Surprisingly only nominated for 2 Academy Awards Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film Editing Hollywood rarely awards comedies no matter how well they are made
and laugh out loud funny in many scenes br br The movie s basic plot is well chronicled a story of opposites trying to find a way to survive each other in close proximity br br This is unquestionably Lemmon and Matheau s best film as co stars and the interaction between the sloppy Oscar and the OCD Felix are classic br br The scene where Oscar lines up a double date leaves the room briefly and comes back to find Felix and the two girls all crying is pricelessly funny br br For any fan of intelligent comedies The Odd Couple is a go out of your way to see it film
Based on Neil Simons play of the same The Odd Couple tells the story of best friends Felix Unger Jack Lemmon and Oscar Madison Walter Matthau who end up sharing Oscars massive bachelor pad after Felix tries to kill himself br br He had a big row with his wife over his obsessive compulsive cleaning sprees and weird phobias and sends her a suicide telegram She calls Oscar and lets him know what happened Felix turns up at Oscar s during his weekly poker game with their friends Vinnie John Fielder Murray the policeman Herbert Edelman Roy David Sheiner and Speed Larry Haines After some side splitting hysterics it s agreed Felix will stay with Oscar br br The rest of the film centres on how these two are such completely different characters As well as looking at if Oscar can stand Felix s truly weird and unique habits and cleanliness and if Felix can stand Oscar being such a slob and his laid back attitude to everything Really a film about two complete opposites living together and the joys highs lows and necessity of the gift that is friendship With great acting an intelligent and very funny script and the great Monica Evans and Carole Shelley as the British Pigeon sisters who Oscar invites over for a double date br br This one is guaranteed to make you laugh every line is priceless and Jack and Walter are fantastic with a great chemistry Also made into a successful and equally funny TV series with Jack Klugman as Oscar and Tony Randall as Felix
There s nothing really to dislike about The Odd Couple and it s no surprise that Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau make a hugely winning comedic team But there s something so underdeveloped about Neil Simon s adaptation of his hit stage play as to make it seem more like a skit on a sketch comedy show than a full bodied film I have not seen the play but have to assume that the screen version is fairly faithful since Simon wrote it so the defects cannot be blamed on a stage to screen adaptation There are some interesting ideas in this story two recently divorced men who fall immediately into traditional married roles when they become roommates because neither knows any differently that Simon never fully fleshes out Still there are many worse ways to kill a couple of hours
If you delete the first twenty minutes or so of this film you will be left with a fantastic comedy As it is I still found it to be a pretty good movie which is no small feat considering the coma I was put in by the opening scenes To put it mildly this film has a dreary beginning that wasn t even remotely funny or even upbeat Once things get sillier however you are left with a comedy that still holds up well after more than three decades Definitely worth checking out especially if you re a younger fan of Lemmon and Matthau who wants to see their earlier work
THE ODD COUPLE 3 outta 5 stars br br Like most people I will always feel that Jack Klugman and Tony Randall are the definitive Odd Couple Their incredible work on the TV series from the early to mid 70s was a highwater mark for television at the time easily surpassing the stage and screen versions of the tale Nonetheless how can you go wrong with a Jack Lemmon Walter Matthau pairing Matthau is in especially good form as Oscar the slob Lemmon takes a bit of getting used to as Felix particularly if you have previously seen Tony Randall s outstanding performance The script is good definitely Neil Simon s best I will go on record here as stating that Neil Simon is probably one of the worst most over rated playwrights of American theatre The storyline is simple Felix a neat freak and newly separated from his wife moves in with Oscar the slob who needs some help saving money for alimony payments Their living arrangement becomes much like a marriage as well culminating in some amusing tiffs and spats Lots of fun and some great one liners
Here s another film that doesn t really need much of a recommendation It s a classic comedy very funny and entertaining and which of course ultimately inspired a successful television series which many would say was even better I enjoy both personally br br For some it s hard to warm up to Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau as Felix Unger and Oscar Madison when they were were weaned on the TV show starring Tony Randall and Jack Klugman or perhaps vice versa But what we ve got there in both cases are four good actors who in real life seemed so much like their film counterparts that they managed to make these characterizations their own It s Neil Simon s humorous material that s key and where the laughs really originate from br br For those who have somehow never heard of THE ODD COUPLE it s the story of a neurotic and fussy neat freak Lemmon who is thrown out of a 12 year marriage by his long suffering wife and takes up residence in the Manhattan apartment of his sloppy and totally irresponsible buddy Matthau Pitting these two unlikely roommates together within the same four walls makes for some hugely funny predicaments
There s more to offer in the opening of The Odd Couple than in the entirety of most films Felix Unger the poor guy s monogram even curses him checks into a New York hotel A cleaning lady says Good night Goodbye he answers back In his room he empties his pockets then struggles to take off his wedding ring only to put the objects neatly into an envelope addressed to his wife and beloved children When the viewer finally puts it together aha he s going to off himself we watch him struggle to open the window oh no he s going to jump The poor guy injures his lower back This is all you need to know about Felix Unger his wife has left him he s a compulsive cleaner and he s a hypochondriac And all in one scene This is the particular genius of Neil Simon s comedy it s about situation and character There are few obvious physical jokes no kicks to the groin no cheap gags just funny characters in uncomfortable situations And of course he is a master of manipulating the audience s expectations Coming from the Swingers era imagine what I thought in the date scene when Felix starts lamenting about the breakup of his marriage to the girls his roommate Oscar has worked so hard to get into his apartment He s blowing it right Think again The girls love his sensitivity his ability to cry in front of them They invite him back to their place since his meatloaf has burned because Oscar wasn t paying enough attention to it He s in like Flynn right Uh yes but he doesn t want to go with the girls because he s feeling vulnerable Great stuff And it s made even greater with a style that minimizes editing and maximizes the wonderful eight room apartment set You ve got Jack Lemmon and the slouchy pouchy Walter Matthau for Chrissakes why mess it up The visual style reminded me of Breakfast at Tiffany s in that great effect is made from a large depth of field and the interplay between the various planes of action Particularly memorable is the scene in which Felix fleeing from Oscar closes a partition only to realize the partition doesn t cover the side where Oscar is coming from You get a real sense of the layout of the apartment and thus the proximity in which the two divorc√©es live The twist here is that these two are really married to each other So the observations about married life that might be ignored in an ordinary romantic comedy are made all the more poignant since they are two guys
I don t think I ve really ever given Walter Matthau his due as a comedic performer He s certainly been wonderful in plenty of lighthearted roles but I guess I always put his success down to his characters grumpiness and ruthlessness a gruff contrast to the flamboyant personality of his frequent co star Jack Lemmon and I suppose a natural extension of his earlier work in dramatic pictures Watching Gene Saks The Odd Couple 1968 adapted from a popular Neil Simon play the realisation suddenly clicked Matthau is in his own right absolutely hilarious Initially striking the audience as filthy crude and generally unappealing his Oscar Madison eventually manages to worm his way into our hearts culminating in a hilariously overplayed confession of emotions that Matthau rasps out in a voice not entirely his own At the same time while holding his own as a comedian his interplay with Lemmon is of course pitch perfect indeed the film rightly belongs to both actors who have never failed to light up the cinema screen by themselves let alone together br br Calling to mind Billy Wilder s screenplay for The Apartment 1960 this Neil Simon comedy builds itself around around a rather morbid premise Compulsive house cleaner Felix Unger Lemmon having just been evicted by his wife of twelve years attempts to commit suicide but fruitlessly abandons the idea after he wrecks his back trying to open the hotel window Dejected he arrives at the house of good friend Oscar Matthau a divorced slob who lives alone on a diet of potato crisps and green sandwiches that might contain either very new cheese or very old meat Oscar kindly offers Felix a place to stay but is soon overwhelmed by his friend s finicky personality and constant insistence on absolute cleanliness The pair form an unusual sort of marital arrangement with Felix assuming the role of the effeminate and constantly nagging wife and Oscar as the sloppy unappreciative husband who always comes home later than he s supposed to This is a marriage that barely lasts three weeks and by the end of it we can completely sympathise with Felix s ex wife who remains unseen br br The Odd Couple is a terrific comedy most of all because it has a lot of heart For all their arguing it s obvious that the two roommates have plenty of affection for each other most movingly seen when Felix tries to launch into a furious tirade instead perhaps inadvertently ending up informing Oscar how tops he his The pair s four poker buddies John Fiedler Herb Edelman David Sheiner and Larry Haines are also constantly badgering each other about some obscure annoyance but you can t deny that they ve got the best of intentions Their decision to treat Felix as though nothing has happened to him may have sounded fine in theory but maybe being ignored wasn t quite the correct solution to Felix s gloomy feelings of inadequacy and inconsequentiality Unlike some comedies based on popular stage plays I was recently disappointed by Wilder s The Seven Year Itch 1955 this film doesn t simply strike at the same chord throughout and the relationship between the two leads is progressively developed through tears laughter and much disagreement
A simple comment br br What can I say this is a wonderful film that I can watch over and over It is definitely one of the top ten comedies made With a great cast Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau wording a perfect script by Neil Simon based on his play br br It is real to life situation done perfectly If you have digital cable one gets the menu on bottom of screen to give what is on It usually gives this film stars but in reality it deserves stars If you really watch this film one can tell that it will be as funny and fresh a hundred years from now
Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau began and ending their career together Remember best as the Grumpiest of Old Men as well as the Oddest Couple to have ever made us laugh Lemmon and Matthau were one of Hollywood s best loved comedy teams of the last 100 years Not as raunchy as Pryor and Wilder instead they were the classic comedy team that reflected a more modern Marx Brothers routine Such as the physical comedy as well as the mixed blend of chaos that Marx Chaplin and Keaton were so famous for In the Odd Couple Lemmon and Matthau play complete opposites that create the chaos The physical comedy is as unique as Chaplins The joke is usually on themselves as oppose to passing the joke onto another Not your typical guy film it is in a way a coming of age comedy with two old men as oppose to two young teenagers in their prime The chemistry between Lemmon and Matthau is entertainment enough Although this movie isn t for everyone this is a great comedy
Often laugh out loud sometimes sad story of 2 working divorced guys Lemmon a neurotic clean house husband and Matthau a slob sportswriter who decide to live together to cut down on expenses br br Nicely photographed and directed The script is very barbed that is there s always more than one side to almost every line Particularly funny scene involves 2 british sisters Evans and Shelley who seem amused by everything anyone says but when Lemmon busts out his photos of kids and yes ex wife to be he has the girls sobbing along with him before Matthau can show up with the promised drinks br br Very entertaining
The Odd Couple is one of those movies that far surpasses its reputation People all know it they hum the theme song they complain of living with a sloppy Oscar or a fastidious Felix but they re under selling the film without knowing it This isn t just about a neat guy living with a sloppy guy it s a portrait of two friends helping each other through the agony of divorce It s also damn funny from start to finish but it s the kind of comedy that arises from realistic stressful and just plain awful situations So some viewers have actually found the film to be a bit uncomfortable but I think its verisimilitude is its strength Besides Matthau s bulldog face just cracks me up My favorite comedy by a country mile
The Odd Couple is a comic gem One the funniest script ever committed to celluloid exceeded only by Strangelove Spinal Tap and Lebowski Lemmon and Matthau are best friends obsessive compulsive Felix and sloppy irresponsible Oscar Oscar s wife has already left him because he is impossible to live with due to his irresponsible attitude Felix s wife leaves him at the start of the movie and after an aborted suicide attempt he moves in with poker buddy Oscar Thats when the fun begins br br The entire script is brilliant and filled with brilliant one liners You are probably already familiar with the F U joke but it still works brilliantly due to Matthau s comic timing br br My favorite moments are when Lemmon tries to clear his sinus in the diner and when the Pigeon sisters are being charmed by a very suave Matthau and Lemmon is totally out of his element This one requires repeat viewings
Simon s best comedy is superbly crafted by director Gene Saks and given life by the immense talents of Lemmon and Matthau No one delivers these lines better No one times them better Nobody does it better
This cordial comedy confronts a few bizarre characters Especially of course the two leading characters Jack Lemmon plays Felix a hypochondriac whose wife lost him because she couldn t stand his cleaning and cooking attacks any longer So he tries to kill himself but every attempt fails Walter Matthau plays Oscar his friend an untidy unreliable sports reporter who lives in divorce from his ex wife in a bachelor apartment He offers his distressed friend Felix a new home in his apartment And soon the trouble begins because two such contrary characters can t live together for a long time Felix turns Oscar s disorderly flat into a clean exhibition flat He cleans and cooks the whole time After a short while Oscar feels persecution mania Filmed in a theatrical way and excellent acted Above all Jack Lemmon s play is wonderful He is the perfect clown He makes us laugh but in a tragi comic way Look for the wonderful scene when both men invite their two female neighbours for supper because Oscar has to touch something more softer than a bowling ball While he is preparing the drinks Felix sits with the two young ladies in the living room To get out of this embarrassing situation he starts to talk about the weather A minute later he changes the subject and talks about his ex wife and children Suddenly he begins to weep and when Oscar comes back with the drinks there are three weeping people in the living room The film is full of such amusing and at the same time touching scenes An intelligent entertaining comedy with much heart 10 out of 10
I simply can t get over how brilliant the pairing of Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon is It s like the movie doesn t even need additional characters because you can never get tired of the dialog between these two br br Lemmon had already been in several well known films like Mr Roberts and The Apartment and Matthau was fresh off his Oscar win for The Fortune Cookie another Billy Wilder film also with Lemmon That particular movie wasn t as great as this one because the story couldn t sustain such a long running time I think it was almost 2 hours However this goes by at a brisk hour and a half even though the introduction of the events leading up to Lemmon ending up at Matthau s apartment is a tad long so was this sentence That s a minor quibble though and for the rest of the running time you have a marvelous time br br I have already written a comment about how the follow up to this film sucked and I won t go deeper into that The reason why this is such a joy is probably that the movie was made just as the innocence of American movies was beginning to fade fast into oblivion There are some sexual references but they are dealt with in such an innocent way that you couldn t even get a Well I never out of the most prudish person out there It is kind of fun to see a movie from a long lost era and that was probably why the sequel didn t work because you had Matthau and Lemmon say quite a few f words and that just doesn t fit them br br Of course now they are both gone and you can just be happy that you still can enjoy them in a marvelous film like this I think the only male actor in this film who is still alive is John Fiedler Edelman died recently So there you have it Simply one of the best comedies and films ever br br Add I have just learned recently that John Fiedler has died so to all the fans of him I am deeply sorry I didn t mean any disrespect and I will try to be more careful of what I am blah blah blahing next time
I saw this many years after the television series and initially I didn t care for it Then as my memory of the series receded with the passage of time I watched again and found it absolutely hilarious Based on the stage play by Neil Simon it has not been opened out much for the big screen and that s one of its strengths Walter Matthau and Jack Lemmon are brilliant as Oscar and Felix and the supporting cast are wonderful particularly John Fielder as Vinnie Even now certain moments can reduce me to tears of laughter Felix interrupting Oscar in the middle of a ball game with a dinner request Oscar cracking up and chasing Felix around the apartment the giggling Pigeon Sisters brought low by Felix s sob stories and of course the legendary cafeteria scene later ripped off by Nora Ephron s When Harry Met Sally Razor sharp dialogue too When the boys think Felix has taken an overdose Oscar says They could be vitamins He could be the healthiest one in the room Fantastic
I have seen this film many times and I like all bad teachers want to give it ten out of ten but feel that it would be unfair to other good films However I do think that this is one of those rare gems a perfect comedy It is I would venture one of the greatest comic films of all times Matthau and Lemmon are perfectly matched and mismatched The script is so sharp that you need to staunch the bleeding The story is well known and has already been described in other comments The two leads give extraordinary performances the girls are superb and the situations are side splittingly funny Not one swear word in sight mark that Hollywood you don t have to swear to be funny you have to be witty and the move from stage to film is seamless They don t make em like this any more Timeless
SPOILERS br br In the words of Jean Paul Sartre Hell is other people In The Odd Couple Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau demonstrate just how accurate this can be As Felix Ungar and Oscar Madison Lemmon and Matthau respectively create two good friends who decide to live together As the two begin to slowly grow more and more frustrated with each other the laughs come thick and fast before Felix departs leaving Oscar a changed and more cleanly individual br br Jack Lemmon as Ungar is absolutely superb as the neurotic cleaning obsessed divorcee coping with life as a single man Walter Matthau in contrast to Lemmon s character is equally as good as the slobbish sports writer who simply wants to play poker to earn money for his child benefits br br Lemmon and Matthau are magnificant in their selected parts to some degree dependent upon the beautiful script by Neil Simon and simultaneously because they work well as a team As two friends who are inherently different in lifestyles although similar in relationships with ex wives and children these two late great actors create a partnership which is practically impossible to recreate So great in fact that the world screamed out so much for something similar that two years before Matthau s death and three before Lemmon s the characters were reunited in an inferior sequel This idea whilst following Hollywood s irritating obsession with sequels might have worked to a certain degree but at the same time it could never come close to replicating the genius of this original film br br Ultimately it s not really possible to say anything else With Simon s amazing script filled with humour and laughter the creators of this film were already onto a hit The casting of Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau as Felix Ungar and Oscar Madison though is the most important part of this film The Odd Couple with it s traditional soundtrack which even gained a tribute in The Simpsons it s excellent script and it s genius leading men is a tribute to cinema and a feature for history to remember
A FROLICS OF YOUTH Short Subject br br A teenager embarrassed by his fear of dogs runs away from home The abandoned spaniel he finds helps to change his mind br br PARDON MY PUPS is an enjoyable little film with Shirley Temple stealing all her scenes as the hero s lively kid sister The opening gag dealing with bedwetting is in poor taste but is quickly forgotten Highlight the climactic fisticuffs which look impressively realistic br br Often overlooked or neglected today the one and two reel short subjects were useful to the Studios as important training grounds for new or burgeoning talents both in front behind the camera The dynamics for creating a successful short subject was completely different from that of a feature length film something akin to writing a topnotch short story rather than a novel Economical to produce in terms of both budget schedule and capable of portraying a wide range of material short subjects were the perfect complement to the Studios feature films
In the 1930s studios would use short films like this one sort of as testing grounds for new actors given their relative ease of production in comparison with full length feature films so it s interesting that this one should star Shirley Temple who had long since established herself as The Most Famous Child Star of All Time Then again she probably wasn t the one being tested I would imagine that would have been Frank Coghlan Jr who played Shirley s brother Sonny in the movie and delivered a comparatively less impressive performance Then again a 9 year old Shirley Temple was probably not an easy act to accompany br br The film opens with an unimpressive sight gag involving a leaky ceiling which I suppose was designed to have Shirley Temple give a scornful look at the ceiling illustrate the working class status of the family in the movie and provide a clean transition into the next scene which features Shirley gleefully stomping in the rain br br It s Sonny y birthday and his father makes occasional and horrendously botched efforts to hide the fact that he wants to give Sonny a dog that he really wants for himself but Sonny is afraid of dogs because he was bitten by one once and has been creeped out ever since It s curious that when his father insists on getting a dog Sonny decides to run away from home rather than have a dog in the house and as he is running away with no destination in sight it s also curious that the movie illustrates what seems to be an indifference to homeless people that surpasses even the astounding indifference that exists today br br Sonny passes a man cooking bacon in an iron skillet at the side of the train tracks right after a train flew by which given how close to the tracks he was you would think would have blown the guy right off the tracks but no matter After Sonny gives up on sharing breakfast due to the sour stare that his gleeful smile receives from the guy he continues on and the homeless guy disappears from the movie It s interesting to consider what a longer film would have done because this one leaves this poor guy as a loose end br br Not that that matters Sonny soon hears a dog whining underneath a trestle as he passes over it and jumps down to find a dog covered in burrs It might seem trite that he immediately takes the dog up and adopts it since he just left home because of his fear of dogs but it seemed to me that he just needed to be reminded not of his power over dogs but of their lack of power over him As soon as he saw a dog in need he overcame his fear br br Hey if that s all it takes all I have to do is find a helpless spider and I m set br br It s a very convenient movie in which everything works out exactly as it is supposed to but it s cute enough and enjoyable enough and short enough as it were to still be a fun movie We already don t expect an epic plot in a 19 minute film but Pardon My Pups still packs in a substantial amount of story and character development in its short running time And it also features a fight scene at the end of the movie that must have made Charlie Chaplin proud I am hardly an expert of Shirley Temple s films but it s not hard to see how she became The Most Famous Child Star of All Time
One of the many Merrie Melodies cartoons that entertained American moviegoers during WWII Bob Clampett s An Itch in Time portrays a hobo flea settling on Elmer Fudd s dog The little guy turns into a real sadist while making a home on the dog s back but Elmer warns the dog One more scwatch and I ll give you a bath Meanwhile the flea is setting up dynamite on the dog And that s not the end I noticed that in one scene Elmer is reading a comic book featuring Bugs Bunny and Porky Pig Obviously Elmer and Bugs frequently co starred but Elmer never co starred with Porky unless you count the very short Any Bonds Today But to me the thought of Elmer reading about these other famous characters from his same genre stresses the metaphysical nature of his world as though he knew of their existence within his universe even though they don t appear in this cartoon br br Of course I m probably going too far in my analysis I m sure that the cartoon was intended as pure entertainment and it certainly entertains As for the I might get to like this line it sounds as though that was something that the censors wouldn t have allowed but somehow missed I for one don t actually know what it was supposed to sound like Was it something sexual As for the end had I thought that I d seen everything I would have been tempted to look for more rather than do what the cat did although it was a neat trick br br The guys behind these cartoons sure had a thing for TNT didn t they
Bob Clampett s An Itch in Time milks seven minutes of crazy action out of a very small premise Elmer Fudd tells his dog that if he scratches himself just once more that he will be given a dreaded bath Unfortunately for the dog a relentless flea makes it all but impossible to stop from scratching The cartoon switches between the flea s progress inside the dog s fur and the dog s desperate attempts to cope with it In a great sequence that really captures the frustration of an itch that can t be scratched the dog changes colour from brown to blue to red to polka dotted to plaid It sounds ludicrously surreal but it perfectly evokes the indescribable feeling of an itch in a way only Clampett could There are several other elements which make An Itch in Time pure Clampett There s the grotesque concept itself which leads to some graphic scenes of the flea munching on the dog s flesh There s the unrestrained violence that rears its head in any scene featuring the cat Most notably there s the dirty jokes including a huge shot of the dog s behind which causes the flea to wolf whistle and a hysterical sequence in which the dog attempts to scratch himself by dragging his backside along the floor He momentarily breaks off to address the audience Hey I better cut this out I may get to like it With a very limited concept Clampett manages to make An Itch in Time a unique minutiae based cartoon Like an early episode of Seinfeld An Itch in Time is practically about nothing but very funny with it
Elmer Fudd is laughing while lounging in his easy chair and reading his comic book his dog comfortably nearby sleeping in front of the fireplace All is peaceful until a flea comes bouncing by The flea is dressed in a farmer s type outfit with a big sombrero and is carrying a satchel with the name A Flea on it He gets out his telescope and spots the dog We see a big shot of the dog s butt and the flea whistles in excitement screaming T Bone He then sings There s food around the corner there s food around the corner br br That sets up the storyline of this cute but obnoxious flea tormenting the poor dog The mutt is hilarious as he reacts to the flea br br The drawings of his huge teeth chomping right next to the fleeing flea are clever and the dog s dialog made me laugh out loud a few times This might be the funniest canine I have ever seen in a cartoon The poor pooch under a threat of having to take a bath as to NOT react when the stupid flea causes him pain It s almost painful to watch as the flea uses pickaxes jackhammers and the like on the dog He puts firecrackers in the dog s behind It s brutal
An Itch In Time is one of a string of home runs Bob Clampett hit for WB in the early 1940s including Horton Hatches The Egg and Tortoise Wins By A Hare Soaked in manic timing and exaggerated mayhem it s basically the saga of a flea who s busy breaking ground for a new home and the dog whose ground is being broken Because master Elmer will give him a dreaded flea bath if he so much as scratches the unlucky canine is forced to endure an upward spiral of torment as the homesteading flea uses pick axes and power tools to clear the land Ultimately the little monster lights the fuse to a small mountain of high explosives he s piled onto his victim s backside There s a tremendous explosion and the hapless pooch covers his eyes as his rear end erupts in a blazing Fourth of July display That really has to hurt and the dog takes flight but soon he stops the action and says with a merry smile You guys better cut it out cause I think I m starting to like it For years this kinky confession was censored but current prints have restored the clip so now viewers can enjoy it in its original devilish glory Still cut however is the closing gag in which the cat blows his brains out after he laments Now I ve seen everything This was a common gag at WB but it has since been purged from this cartoon and several others including Horton

I ve received this movie from a cousin in Norway and had to convert it from Norwegian to American format with a copied video Comparing this film 1948 with the Heroes of Telemark 1965 Kampen om Tungtvannet The Struggle for the Heavy Water casts the saboteurs themselves playing their respective roles though actors were also cast to play the roles of the saboteurs who have given their lives in Norway s struggle for freedom in later campaigns The plot is in four languages Norwegian along with French German and English complete with Norwegian subtitles br br Impressive during this course of history was what led to the struggle French scientists were interested in obtaining some two hundred kilograms of heavy water from Norsk Hydro in Vemork to take back to France in order to do lab studies on its effectiveness Simultaneously the Nazis too were interested in obtaining heavy water to build a secret weapon The French were worried that the Nazis might take an early lead by invading Norway and through secret codes their man carefully eluded Nazi spies on his trip to Oslo where he received the heavy water and making it back without hindrance He was watched by two spies as he boarded an airliner but they did not see him hop out on the other side where he crossed the tarmac to another plane nearby where his cargo was waiting for him This clever trick worked by using the airliner as a decoy that the Nazis later forced down in Hamburg br br However the invasion of Norway on the morning of April 9 1940 the Nazis took over Norsk Hydro and it was up to the Norwegian Underground and British intelligence in London to take action Professor Leif Trondstad volunteered the services of eleven young Norwegians the Swallow and Gunnerside groups who would successfully sabotage the heavy water production in Vemork This was shown in detail on how they actually carried out the operation including the sinking of the ferryboat after the Nazis abandoned Norsk Hydro to take the shipment of heavy water on rail cars to Berlin br br The quality of the film was fair though there were many splices in the film I highly recommend this film to anyone interested in World War II history
This movie is a half documentary and it is pretty interesting br br This is a good movie based on the true story of how a bunch of norwegian saboturs managed to stop the heavy water production in Rukjan Norway and the deliverance of the rest of the heavy water to Germany br br This movie isn t perfect and it could have been a bit better the best part of the movie is that some of the saboturs are played by themselves br br If you re interested in history of WWII and film this is a movie that s worth a look
by saying that I mean that this is not a well made movie but it s a very good version of the real event and the best depiction so far and if you are a WW2 buff then this is a treat for you cause there are three out of four saboteur members playing roles in this movie It s theater acting at best but then this is still as said before a semi documentary br br Me personally am a die hard fan of our nearly over human heroes of the second world war and there should be hundreds of these movies showing us what they did so it won t get forgotten by next generations Cause nowadays kids doesn t read books they watch movies br br So if you want a action extravaganza rent Private Ryan this is the truth about lingering pain outrageous endurance and the will to fight when all seems lost
It tries to be the epic adventure of the century And with a cast like Sh√¥ Kasugi Christopher Lee and John Rhys Davies it really is the perfect B adventure of all time It s actually is a pretty fun swashbuckling adventure that even with it s flaws captures your interest It must have felt as the biggest movie ever for the people who made it Even if it s made in the 90s it doesn t have a modern feel It more has the same feeling that a old Errol Flynn movie had Big adventure movie are again the big thing in Hollywood but I m afraid that the feeling in them will never be the same as these old movies had This on the other hand just has the real feeling You just can t hate it I think it s an okay adventure movie And I really love the soundtrack Damn I want the theme song
This was a really cool movie It just goes to prove that you don t need silly litle things like continuity and scripts to make a movie It traverses continents in seconds people get shot and nothing happens to them swords set on fire samuari fight on sinking galleons David Essex is the epitome of slimey villainy and John Rhys Davies is just the dude I enjoyed this movie but I like s t movies this is the perfect example of a very s t movie that just KICKS ASS If you like Battlefield Earth you ll love this film its swashbuckling its fast its silly its samuaraitastic br br It also looks as if it was made in 1972
I find this movie the best movie I have ever seen because it reflects the inner strength of a young girl during the second world war The movie is impressive not least because it actually happened It reminds me of the story of Anne Frank br br
this movie is a masterpiece a story of a young woman during the war and it really happen not exactly as the movie but it is a great story i was impress by this film the acting and the story where great i like this film because it is a true story it s Giff me a feeling that i was there and i feel sorry for the ca rector that Maruschka Detmers is playing because who wants to end here life that way i recommend that everybody have to see this film special the young ones and ma by the learn something from this film This film you can compare whit the movie soldier from orange or any real story that happened in the WW2
As a another reviewer states Hanna s War is an outstanding film about an outstanding person Hanna Anniko Senesh who would become the Jewish Joan Of Arc Unfortunately I diverge in opinion not agreeing that Miss Detmers as the lead is too beautiful to be taken seriously as a resistance fighter In truth for me her performance is not held back by her beauty but makes it all the more stark in the terror of the sadistic brutality as a resistor she faces Maruschka Detmers performance is brave poignant heartfelt or understood and totally believable In other words for me In the zone from the opening credits If you would like to learn about the suffering of someone else for something they believe in and be impressively entertained give Hanna s War with Maruschka Detmers a try My hat is off also to Ellen Burstyn as Hanna s mother a much well known and famous actress who could have made effort to walk off with the film In that it is a team effort perhaps of two actress but not an All About Eve situation
It sounds a bit awkward to call a film about war and holocaust shocking since many of us will know only too well of the horrors that war and violence brings By using the adjective shocking I do not intend to imply that I am surprised about the things told about in this film or that I was formerly unaware of them it is just that I am very much impressed by the way in which this film shows how crazy and incomprehensibly horrific it is to kill each other off either with or without a reason br br The first part of the film focuses on Hanna s successful participation in the Hungarian resistance Maruschka Detmers would never have won an Oscar for this performance due to inconsistent directing but still her acting is solid enough and she has enormous charisma She is cast very well as Hanna and immediately has our sympathy Her very beautiful looks help of course but that has nothing to do with her being simply a good actress playing a good part br br Certain inconsistencies keep occurring in Hanna s War I sometimes get the idea director Menahem Golan often despised for The Gianni Versace Murder was in a rush and should actually have allowed a few more takes per scene On the other hand I am very thankful he made this impressive and thought provoking film and as I am very positive about it I think he did a good job br br The second half of the film is the most interesting and tragic one It focuses on Hanna s suffering beware of Donald Pleasence s scary portrayal of the cruel and sardonic captain Rosza and intensely shows the injustice and horror that comes with hate and violence and war I receive Hanna s War especially the second half as a strong anti war film and for that alone Golan deserves credit It is also this second half in which Maruschka Detmer s talent comes out creating a character which goes into film history as one of the most speaking strong and tragic ever portrayed It is also great to see Ellen Burstyn whose appearance and acting style always remind me of Romy Schneider who had she been alive and cast would have made a similar effective contribution to Hanna s War br br The tragic impact of the second half and the desperate tension which is sometimes replaced by hopeful prospects and good news lead to a number of final scenes which show something so unexpected so moving and poetic in its tragedy that it hit me like a bomb and left me in tears And when I realized once more it wasn t even fiction it all actually happened I found myself in even more tears The image of Hanna portrayed by Maruschka Detmers will be in my mind forever
For someone who remembers Jane in the Daily Mirror strip cartoon viewing this film is an exercise in nostalgia In that context it is wonderful but younger viewers would undoubtedly find the comedy limp and would miss the point that the actors are cartoon characters The plotline is also a bit limp for today s audience but reflects the naivety of the 40s and 50s very well Jane you must remember was part of the escapist fantasy of the wartime years created to boost the morale of the troops She gave a double meaning to the strip in strip cartoon br br The story has something in common with the tales of Edgar Rice Burroughs and Rider Haggard The theme would have been a familiar one to readers in that era a bunch of bumbling Nazis thwarted by a few equally bumbling Englanders and set in the African jungle of course br br For Jane fans a must see For the rest of you a damp squib br br

This movie catches a lot of flak but this is usually based on the horrible looking and covered clothed version of the film that played US television and has also been issued to death on VHS and DVD buy companies like Alpha Unicorn etc This movie never had a theatrical release in the states although it was picked up by Avco Embassy in 1973 In Spain at the time when there was nudity involved the filmmakers shot two versions one with clothes and one with out The fully uncut English dubbed export print was titled WEREWOLF NEVER SLEEPS and seems to have been released to home video only in Sweden back in the 80 s It can be found on Ebay and the likes and comes highly recommended My guess is Avco cut the film down for a R rated release that never happened In 1974 it was released by Avco to television titled FURY OF THE WOLFMAN and the clothed version was used for this TV print Cut to 12 years later and FURY OF THE WOLFMAN pops up on home video on the Charter label This version appears to be what Avco was going to release back in 73 It s the uncovered version with some nudity that would never pass on TV or in a PG movie There are several scenes on the Charter tape that play out with nudity that are clothed in the TV print the source for all those dollar Dud s and VHS editions But a comparison to the fully uncut WOLFMAN NEVER SLEEPS reveals that 2 scenes are cut on this version spoilers in next paragraph The scene where Ilona has Waldermar chained to the wall and whips him after he transforms into the werewolf is incomplete After whipping him into submission she starts to remove her clothes and begins making love to the werewolf The werewolf responds positively to these sexual shenanigans too This scene certainly ranks as one of the most unusual in the history of horror films and is a delirious treat It s not graphic but the implied bestiality was too much for US audiences or more likely the MPAA Ilona is desperately in love with Waldemar and could not possess him hence her whole scheme to mind control Waldermar s wife and involve her in an affair She wanted to wreck his marriage and she accomplishes this while Waldemar is in Tibet Unfortunately he returns a werewolf but this does not slow her down a bit If she can t physically have him as a man she loves him enough to have sex with him as a werewolf This also helps explain the later scene where the werewolf beds down with a woman he spots getting naked before bedtime while peeping through her window This scene is presented sans nudity in the covered version and really makes no sense In the uncut version it would seem Ilona s affections have made the werewolf horny and in need of release so he rapes the first woman he can after escaping The other cut is a complete scene of Waldemar in bed with Karen and she is seen naked A very similar bedroom scene was cut out of the US version of WEREWOLF SHADOW WEREWOLF VS THE VAMPIRE WOMAN as well The film does have it s problems though for certain The director was drunk the bad stand in for the werewolf at points the atrocious English dubbing the inclusion of sequences from the first Waldemar film MARK OF THE WOLFMAN aka FRANKENSTEIN S BLOODY TERROR and the grotesque overuse of that film s music score throughout etc but seen in it s original widescreen format and uncut ie WEREWOLF NEVER SLEEPS it is one of the wildest and most outrageous of the Daninsky werewolf series with a plot line unmatched in it s everything but the kitchen sink approach The cut clothed pan and scan full screen copies of this film do it no favors and unfortunately that s the version almost everyone commenting on the film have seen The film carries a 1970 copyright and I d bet the 1972 release date on the IMDb is incorrect The film precedes WEREWOLF SHADOW aka WEREWOLF VS THE VAMPIRE WOMAN in the series and was certainly released before WEREWOLF SHADOW The ending of WEREWOLF NEVER SLEEPS FURY OF THE WOLFMAN dovetails directly into the opening of WEREWOLF SHADOW offering concrete evidence of this Sadly a complete version of this may never get a decent release A perfect release would be the uncut English version but in Spanish with English subtitles The English dubbing severely hurts the movie But any Spanish language version would reflect the covered version as shown in Spain during the Franco era where nudity was verboten

Someday somebody is going to write an essay comparing Paul Naschy s Fury of the Wolfman to the great Spanish surrealist films L age D or and Un Chien Andelou The Naschy film is a masterpiece of delirium from beginning to end Dali and Bunuel probably loved it and ate their hearts out seeing someone do with such apparent ease what they had to rack their brains to pull off br br The film lacks cohesive structure even though it does have a plot that moves from A to B to C Some mishmash about a Professor Walterman his first name mind you who was bitten by a Yeti monster during an expedition to Tibet and hasn t been the same since which is understandable One of his jealous colleagues the insane daughter of the noted Doctor Wolfstein knows about his condition and reveals that his wife has been cheating on him But its a setup for a twisted scientific experiment to unleash his inner beast br br Walterman flips out turns into a werewolf kills a few people is electrocuted dies is buried unburied taken to a castle filled with circus freaks wired to various machines zapped with assorted electronic effects injected with potent elixirs is chained up turns into a werewolf a woman in an evening gown with thigh high Nazi fetish boots whips him he escapes helps the pretty female doctor find her way out of the castle fends off the circus freaks with a battle axe eventually turns back into a werewolf and has to fight to the death against the female werewolf incarnation of his cheating wife The lady with the Nazi boots shoots him with silver bullets from her Luger pistol they die together and the pretty doctor walks off into the morning with the studly reporter who did nothing Look What a beautiful day it is br br La furia del Hombre Lobo was written by Paul Naschy in a hurry Original director Enrique Eguilez was fired and replaced by Jos√© Mar√≠a Zabalza a drunk who was infamously intoxicated throughout the production He was often unable to work though he did find time to instruct his 14 year old nephew to make some alterations to the script and Naschy ended up directing much of the film uncredited Zabalza did rally enough to clip some action scenes from one of Naschy s previous movies Mark of the Wolfman The scenes were fortunately good enough to use twice even if the costumes were different and helped pad out the runtime after Zabalza refused to get out of bed to finish the movie Post production was a nightmare Nobody knew who was doing the editing the money ran out the master print disappeared for a while and then at a pre release screening for a film distributor the executive arrived to find Zabalza urinating into the gutter in front of the theater He was too drunk to find the restroom but at least he made it to the curb br br Yet somehow the film works if you let it It keys into those atavistic memories we have about murky castles vaulted catacombs chains whips gloomy moors Fans of those sort of things will find it hypnotically watchable even if the story as a whole doesn t make much sense due to the fractured discontinuity of the execution In one scene its pouring rain and the wolfman howls at the lightning in the next shot its bone dry and he s howling at the full moon Then its raining again And yet you don t look at it as a gaffe Its like an unfolding dream where contradictions are possible opposites are the same and effects proceed causes First the wolfman picks up the power cable and screams and then the cable starts sparking with electricity People say its low budget hurts the overall effectiveness I say the film would have been unwatchable if they had a dime more to spend It is a marvel of making something out of nothing and succeeds not because of what it could of had but because of what it does It s easy to laugh at stuff like this and even easier to dismiss it The trick is being able to see through the mayhem or rather to regard the chaos as part of the effect br br Paul Naschy died last week at the age of 75 He had been ill with pancreatic cancer for a year or more was working on film projects right up until his last days but passed away in Madrid Spain with his family while receiving chemotherapy treatment His rich varied and surprisingly lengthy career is a legacy to a man stubbornly pursuing his artistic vision in the face of universal mainstream disinterest And yet in all of us there is an eleven year old kid who will watch his movies like Fury of the Wolfman in rapt awe Even people who don t like Euro Horror will discover something in this movie to marvel at if only for just a minute in a couple spots You can find it for free at Archive Org or even buy it on a DVD for a nickel It s worth far far more br br Amusingly Naschy was horrified to learn that many others like myself regard this twisted sick demented little movie as a classic if not an outright masterpiece of Cinema Dementia The problems he encountered during the production and the mess of a film that was left after were perhaps too personal an artistic disappointment for Naschy to forgive I would never presume to dare to forgive it for him but I will say this I d rather watch Fury of the Wolfman in its dingiest most

I absolutely LOVE this movie and would really like to have it someday It s just a fascinating legend about an eagle who wears a Turquoise necklace I loved it and would like to see it again I don t remember too much about it but that a Native American boy lives in a nice village with his family and I don t remember what happens but he is supposed to go out to the wilderness alone His sister packs him some food and he goes While he s out there some other Indian boys come running out and put some feathers on him and he turns into an eagle The legend says that if you ever see an eagle wearing a Turquoise necklace it is the boy I was always fascinated with legends particularly Native American legends and I would love to see this released someday to a DVD PLEASE RELEASE IT whoever s concerned
This movie was great and I would like to buy it The boy goes with his grandfather to catch a young eagle the boy has to feed and care for the eagle until it is old enough to be sacrificed for the crops the boy saves the eagle from being killed and runs away from the tribe The eagle helps feed him by catching a duck from a small pond the boy scares up Later the boy shoots a deer that a bully kid was claiming because their arrows were marked very close the same Only until they check the thickness of the red lines do they determine who actually got the deer But this was unfortunate because it made the other boys even crueler to him and at the end he is being chased up onto a cliff but when you think he will fall off his pure love for the eagle transforms him into a golden eagle with only a necklace as a reminder of who he was Please if anyone knows where I can buy this movie let me know I haven t seen it for over 30 years but still remember parts of the movie deniselacey2000 yahoo com
Man I loved this movie This really takes me back to when I was a kid These were the days when the teachers still showed classroom films on reel to real and if you were good they would rewind the movie slowly so you could watch it play backward I still remember one of the opening lines Tutazema was his name and he was an Orphan He lived with his sister so and so in the village This is a great movie for kids and as enduring as the red balloon At the end the other Indian boys in the village attach the feathers to Tutazema and he becomes an eagle himself He gets to live the way he always wanted to He gets to soar the heavens
Oh the sixties There were some interesting films I was more of a movie goer then I now enjoy renting movies and relaxing in my home rather than going to the theater I also saw this short film The Legend of the Boy and the Eagle I have been searching for this film for years It was truly inspiring Surprisingly I was finally able to gather more information from your site Thank You I m surprised to find out that this short film was an opening for a Disney picture I too did not remember the Disney film I did not even remember that it was an opening film for Disney I truly wish they would show this on TV sometime I wonder if Disey holds the rights to this film Is it available on DVD This is a must see for all generations
I ve also been looking to find this movie for quite some time and how great it would be to find it on DVD br br I saw this movie when I was about 6 years old in the Netherlands And I was very impressed by it It was shown before Walt Disney s JUNGLE BOOK br br What I remember of this movie is fragmented I remember that an Indian boy was friends with an eagle This impressed me very much For some reason he was thrown out of his village did not grasp the reason for this When other boys threw stones at him he climbed a rock and jumped off At that time he turned into an eagle and flew away with his eagle friend As an eagle he was still wearing his turquoise necklace br br CB
My son was 7 years old when he saw this movie he is now on a Russian Fishing vessel and said that the movie he was most impressed with and that has lingered in his mind all of these 39 years is the movie of The Legend of the Boy and the Eagle He has asked if it were possible for me to get this for him I am sure that a lot of things go through his head as he has only 3 hours of daylight and he has been on this ship for 3 months and will have 3 more months before his contract expires Since we have Indian blood he connects to this movie On January 27th he will turn 47 years old and I would like to be able to obtain this movie for him He lives in Thailand and has been a commercial fisherman for the past 17 years and as we all know this is one of the most dangerous jobs Can you help me obtain this movie Thanking you in advance Dolly Crout Soto Deerfield Beach FL
I remembered seeing this movie when i was a kid one day on the wonderful world of Disney This movie has been in my memory for over 30 years and I have been looking for it I would have to say that out of all the kids movies I saw back then this one stuck out more than all of them and after only seeing it once I really hoped I would get to see it again The story and images of this movie have been burned into my memory To this day I never did see it after that day back in the 70s in fact I never remembered the title until an internet search earlier today disclosed it to me I loved it and want my kids to see it Does anybody know where I can find it
I just found the IMDb and searched this film and I was moved almost to tears by the comments of all the people who saw this film as I did when 6 or so years old in 1967 I saw it before the Jungle Book so I was Eagle Boy for a few hours and then Mowgli for the next year I burst into tears at the cinema when the boy turned into the Eagle and always wanted to see the film again When we got home we had a Roast chicken dinner and I got the wish bone and guess who I wished to be My dad then said I bet you wished to be an Eagle and of course we all know that wishes are broken if someone guesses so more tears and a little resentment to this day for not being able to fly away
My favorite movie What a great story this really was I d just like to be able to buy a copy of it but this does not seem possible
I have seen this movie when I was about 7 years old which was 33 years ago and I never forgot this movie I was deeply touched and moved by the brave little boy and the beautiful eagle And I just couldn t believe it when he turned into an eagle just when everyone in the theater thought he was going to die br br My sister was in the movie with me and I asked her recently if she remembered the movie we saw with the boy and the eagle and she said she remembered it like we saw it only yesterday So it isn t just me br br This movie is a MUST SEE br br You will never forget it just like my sister and me
I read so many comments that I too shared about remembering this movie and wanting so badly to see it again but I didn t know the name of the movie Thankfully because of doing a search and finding the title on this site I read the comments left here and realized that this was the movie I remembered I then did a search and did find the movie and was so thrilled to be able to watch the movie once more 40 years later Because of this site and your comments you helped me and so I want to thank all of you I want to share how I was able to find this movie for all of you who were looking for a copy as well It was on the VHS version of Wonderful World of Disney s Call it Courage which contained 2 movies the second one being The Legend of the Boy and the Eagle It touched me now as much as it did 40 years ago and now I own my own copy of it I think it is only available on VHS I found it on ebay and I have seen several copies of it there Enjoy it I know I did br br It is a wonderful story about the love of a boy and the eagle he took care of When it was time to sacrifice the eagle the boy set the eagle free because he couldn t allow it to be killed After the boy was forced to leave the tribe for punishment after freeing the eagle the eagle too saved the boy s life and more than that taught him how to survive The closeness that the boy and the eagle shared in the wilderness was so moving and the filming was really remarkable What a wonderful era this was I have never seen anything come even close to this movie
I couldn t agree more with the other comment it s like Falling down Peter Weller is OK and William Hurt great as always except in Lost in Space This is a good movie With pretty good performances Very recommendable If you like Falling down you re going to enjoy this one 8 of 10
The story has been told before A deadly disease is spreading around But the extra in this film is Peter Weller his interpretation of Muller on the run is real He is indeed a desperate person just going home to see his child This person could be working next to you
William Hurt may not be an American matinee idol anymore but he still has pretty good taste in B movie projects Here he plays a specialist in hazardous waste clean ups with a tragic past tracking down a perennial loser on the run played by former pretty boy Weller who has been contaminated with a deadly poison Current pretty boy Hardy Kruger Jr possibly more handsome than his dad is featured as Weller s arrogant boss in a horrifying sequence at a chemical production plant which gets the story moving Natasha McElhone is a slightly wacky government agent looking into the incident who provides inevitable high cheekboned love interest for hero Hurt Michael Brandon pops up to play a slimy take no prisoners type whose comeuppance you can t wait for The Coca Cola company wins the Product Placement award for 2000 as the soft drink is featured throughout the production shot lovingly on location in a wintery picture postcard Hungary
The Contaminated Man is a good film that has a good cast which includes William Hurt Natascha McElhone Peter Weller Katja Woywood Michael Brandon Nikolett Barabas Hendrick Haese D√©sir√©e Nosbusch Arthur Brauss and Christopher Cazenove The acting by all of these actors is very good Hurt and Weller are really excellent in this film I thought that they performed good The thrills is really good and some of it is surprising The movie is filmed very good The music is good The film is quite interesting and the movie really keeps you going until the end This is a very good and thrilling film If you like William Hurt Natascha McElhone Peter Weller Katja Woywood Michael Brandon Nikolett Barabas Hendrick Haese D√©sir√©e Nosbusch Arthur Brauss Christopher Cazenove the rest of the cast in the film Actio Thrillers Dramas and interesting films then I strongly recommend you to see this film today
Now I had the pleasure of first viewing Contaminated Man when it premiered on TV back in December of 2000 br br An infectious disease expert William Hurt looses his family when an unknown disease enters his home and kills them Now some years later he is now in Russia or someplace I m not sure where exactly all I know is it takes place somewhere in that area Anyway because of budget cutbacks at an infectious disease laboratory they are forced to lay off most of their workers One of them a disgruntled security guard named Joseph Muller played Peter Weller best known for his role as the indestructible Robocop goes in there and demands that they give him his job back He needs this job because he is divorced and he needs it to pay child support So he goes in there a fight breaks out and some things get knocked over dangerous things It s soon discovered that Muller has been infected with a deadly pathogen In fact it s so deadly one drop of his blood will kill a person in matter of seconds Soon word gets out and the disease expert Hurt is called in to investigate and he later teamed up with an American reporter Now Muller is determined to get home to see his wife and son and will stop at nothing even if he has to infect the entire Russian population br br Now as I said before this film is a lot like Falling Down We have a disturbed person Weller here Michael Douglas in Falling Down who will stop at nothing to accomplish there goal even if they have to kill a few people in the process Next we have a hero type person Hurt here Robert Duvall in Falling Down who is both sympathetic and determined to stop the antagonist br br Contaminated Man is in fact a very good film with a good story line and some very good performances br br 8 10
The first time i saw it i got half of it but i watched and i knew later on it was about a salem witch trials They focused on the Sara Good s family SHE is famous for cursing a priest which came true In the film it depicts her daughter dorcas and her husband the spirit of Ann Putnam Sara s husband comes to the future hunts this girl to redeem her soul which does happen at the end of the movie Dorcas is depict as witch at 5years old who is burned at the stake Which never happen Ann putnam saves her from the flames the girl is safe she goes to Ann putnam s grave to to see that is not empty but it is at first because she accuse her of witchcraft and lets her burn to death Now that ann putnam saves her her spirit is redeemed and she is not a outcast to society for the salem witch trials
In the seemingly endless quest to find well made well acted horror films it is all too rare to find one that even comes remotely close to hitting the mark Needless to say I was very pleasantly surprised when I stumbled across Burned at the Stake on a U S cable network while I was flipping channels The premise is reasonably simple In 1692 young Ann Putnam Swift is the most vocal witness against alleged witches leveling baseless charges against anyone who earns her displeasure Manipulating her for his own ends is Reverend Parris Peters who also serves as the court s guide on matters pertaining to witchcraft and Satanism Things get complicated when Ann starts accusing members of the Goode family of witchcraft Salem of 1980 or so Loreen Graham also played by Swift begins having unusual visions shortly before she visits the Salem Witch Museum A strange man in seventeenth century garb tries to accost her there and the building He continues to stalk her while strange phenomena begin to involve her more and more Soon it appears that she is becoming possessed by the spirit of Ann Putnam Unfortunately further description gets rather involved and would give too much away Though the film is not action oriented and would likely be of little interest to many viewers the performances are good and the seventeenth century dialogue used in the film s many flashbacks sounds very convincing The production values are solid with the possible exception of some of the special effects In a side note the film s technical advisor was Laurie Cabot Salem s official witch Viewers who appreciate a well made atmospheric but understated horror film may appreciate this The writer director Bert I Gordon has had a long career in horror and science fiction filmmaking and is best known for his work on a number of big bug films and similar works years earlier
The biggest reason I had to see this movie was that it stars Susan Swift an outstanding and all too underappreciated actress Time travel movies usually don t interest me and neither do movies about witchcraft but this movie was fascinating and creepy It didn t rely on outrageous special effects and it didn t focus so heavily on the time travel that the viewer gets lost and confused This was a really creative movie kept simple and focused with great acting by all
For a mature man to admit that he shed a tear over this film is a mature response to a mature film br br If one need admit more then perhaps one could say that Life can never be the same after viewing such advent for it has moved us to the next level br br
Picture Bride has an excellent look into Hawaii s past and the people who lived there in that time The time money earned and the hours that these people had put into their lives to survive and live takes a whole new meaning to blood sweat and tears br br The concept of dating matchmaking is something like what we do similar today via the net Just that is more of snail mail Very slow snail mail br br The singing of the plantation s songs from the workers reminds me of the southern plantation workers songs of their demise and future goals br br The movie shows the hardship as well as soft romantic scenes that Hawaii can bring Like the stillness of a storm coming and the sudden chaos of the rain and then the tranquility
This is a great film From reading other reviews I can see that I m not the only one who shed a tear Tamilyn Tomita acted with such skill and conviction she made the ending heartfelt and memorable In the hands of a lesser actress her last scene would have seemed trite and corny One would never guess this film was done on a tight limited budget The cinematography is gorgeous and there are a number of big name actors The script is so wonderful I can see why they all wanted to be in it If you watch the long long list of credits at the end you ll see that half of Hawaii pitched in to make this film happen and for good reason The soundtrack available on CD is absolutely beautiful and sets the mood throughout the film My only complaint is that I almost didn t want the film to end
I saw this when it premiered and just re watched it on IFC again This is a great telling of the many possible stories about the immigrant farmworker population that came to Hawai i to work the sugar plantations in the early 1900 s My grandparents were part of that migration my parents were born on a Kohala plantation Big Island at the time setting of the movie I moved to the Big Island over a year ago after living in California for over 30 years I was surprised to see that many of the former cane growing lands are still undeveloped with wild cane still growing years after the plantations closed I ve heard many stories from my aunts and uncles who were kids growing up on the plantation This movie helps to image those kinds of stories and memories This story is more of an historical document than a romantic plot driven movie It leaves me shaking my head to read a review like ccthemovieman s Some people just don t get it br br I didn t recall that Youki Kudoh had the starring role with which she did an incredible job I recall her great performances in Jim Jarmusch s Mystery Train and in an Australian film co starring with Russell Crowe Heaven s Burning Tamlyn Tomita did a great job with her pidgin English especially for someone who didn t grow up in the Islands I had forgotten that Toshiro Mifune had a cameo role as the moving picture show narrator And I missed the fact that Jason Scott Lee had an uncredited non speaking part as one of the plantation workers during the payday scene br br I was saddened to find out that the director and co writer Kayo Hatta died in an accidental drowning in 2005 br br There are two other excellent foreign films that mirror this cane plantation experience Gaijin about the immigrant cane workers in Brazil many of them Japanese in the same time period and Sugar Cane Alley about the cane plantation experience in Africa The latter is still available but Gaijin sadly doesn t appear to have been shown in quite a while Another great film about the early Asian in America experience when immigrants were more like slaves is A Thousand Pieces of Gold This was set over the Chinese workers involvement in the building of the railroad starred Rosalind Chao Chris Cooper Michael Paul Chan and Dennis Dun
Good historical drama which is very educational and also very entertaining to people who like history Very good acting and script Not as sensual and sexy as it is sometimes marketed be prepared to peek into the pioneer spirit and human ability to adjust Very touching as well for the spiritually mature Not for people who do not like to think
Japan 1918 The story of 16 year old Ryu begins with the death of her father As it will be revealed later both of her parents have died of tuberculosis In this desperate situation Ryus aunt has arranged a marriage with a Japanese man in Hawai whom they know only from its picture By her arrival in Hawai ryu discovers that her new husband is much older as in the photograph and that he lives in very humble circumstances beside a sugar cane plantage were he works on Ryu not used to the hard labour on the plantage and in despair over her situation in her new home thinks of running away She soon discovers that she has nowhere to go The friendship to Kana a female co worker of hers gives her new hope and strength This picture is based on real events between 1907 and the 1920s when thousands of Asian woman were married off to men in America whom they only knew from their picture This not very well known picture is well written and acted The location is breathtaking This film also features Mifune Toshiro in his very last screen appearance as a Benshi narrator of silent movies This film gives some insight of Japanese culture here and across the ocean A must see
Picture Bride paints a realistic and moving portrait of what it must have been like for Japanese men brought to Hawaii at the turn of the 19th Century to work in the sugar cane fields Most came planning to return to their homeland but few were ever able to do so Equally movingly portrayed is the fate of Japanese women some as young as fifteen or sixteen who were sent as promised brides to men they knew only through photographs that often were 10 or 15 years out of date or were of some other younger man They too worked long hard hours in the fields while fighting homesickness and to preserve their dignity br br Director Hatta s portrayal of one picture bride s courage and perseverance struggling to survive in a strange land and alien society under great physical duress is ultimately inspirational and uplifting a story of moral and cultural survival There is a grandness and magnificence of sweep of character and landscape in Picture Bride that captures the alluring beauty as well as violent harshness of colonial Hawaii This is a film that is emotionally intellectually and artistically rewarding
Distortion is a movie that sort of caught me by surprise A sort of multi layered drama that focuses on a man writing a play about his life experiences that are happening to him right at this moment To be more concise he feels that his wife is cheating on him so he hires a private eye to snoop on him His wife has no idea that this is happening Meanwhile the actors in this play are also having a few whoopdedoodles up their sleeves by fooling around with each other and with shall we say unscrupulous people in the world of Israel The whole thing culminates in a theater with all the actors present and the predictable but not really happens br br The director of the piece really keeps things moving along with the ensemble cast of characters and edits in a way that makes you pay attention This is a fun film actually one which I didn t mind viewing and would recommend people check out
This is arguably the best film director Haim Bouzaglo made until now A skilled TV director well trained in story telling and in directing his actors through long epics he tried to catch in this very low budget film the essence of the very special psychological situation the Israelis live though under the permanent danger of the terror attacks resulting in distorted lives Each character trying to live his own life to watch and control the other while being himself watched and controlled by other characters and mostly by the continuous pressure by political and historical forces well beyond his control Some call this destiny but destiny has a very concrete representation in this film br br There is no explicit political saying in Distortion Characters never discuss politics not even at the level of saying bastards when they hear that a new terror attack happens Their reaction to events is to localize the attack and to count the victims using the official and media terminology for the dead and the wounded They do not really live but rather survive on borrowed time happy to have survived one bomb and waiting for the next one to happen Personal social professional life seems to work someway but is deeply flawed and influenced by events The main character played by the director is a playwright whose mid life personal and creative crisis is amplified by the pressure of the events and by the fact that he is lucky enough to leave a terror attack site minutes before the bomb explodes He hires a private detective to follow his girlfriend who is a TV investigative reporter whom he suspects is falling in for the subject of her next show another failed man former military whose business and family life dismantles under the events He starts to write a play that carbon copies the reality and will bring it to the stage in theater in film scene that reminds Hamlet as well as Synecdoche New York It s not that I would dare suspect Charlie Kaufman looking over the shoulder of Bouzaglo he certainly needs not that but the Israeli director screen is brilliant into anticipating the later film and the first directed by Kaufman As in the American film actors play real persons and start interacting with them in an reality meets stage meets reality melange which never lacks logic at least not artistic logic br br Bouzaglo directs his actors with the usual talent trusts them and allows them the freedom of living through the situations rather then acting them His style is much more free here than in his TV series and the distortion effects although borrowed from American horror movies work pretty well all over The ending seemed to me a little rhetorical and unsatisfying dramatically but the shade of the suicidal killer who is haunting the film and the whole situation in a temporal loop will also follow the viewer when remembering later this film
Distortion is a disturbing haunting film about life imitating art and art reflecting life Haim Bouzaglo the director of the film plays the role of Haim Bouzaglo artistically blocked and sexually impotent playwright who finds inspiration in his suspicions about the subject of his girl friend s documentary As an Arab suicide bomber disguised in skullcap and American t shirt wanders through the landscape in search of his target and his nerves Haim transcribes his girl friend s life as she films her documentary and incorporates himself and his actors lives during rehearsals But the bomber has already struck and Haim has left the restaurant just minutes earlier Despite the manipulation of time and space the story is crystal clear comprehensive and absorbing a brilliant commentary on the distortion of everyday Israeli life where the political is intertwined with the personal where everyone lives on the edge and people never know whether they are playing leading roles in their own lives or are merely dispensable bit players in someone else s dramatic narrative br br Bouzaglo plays with this notion of everyone being an actor in someone else s production brilliantly We are always voyeurs seeing what the fictional director sees illicitly but also what the real director chooses to reveal To remind us that these glimpses are violations of privacy Bouzaglo takes us into the bathroom and the bedroom sometimes the bedroom is the street and rooftop and repeatedly frames his views within TV video or security screens Actors play the role of actors who represent the real characters played by actors Of course each of the actors is the star of his or her own production only dimly aware of their diminished roles in their fellow actor s personal films The detective hired by the playwright becomes a character in the play The actor hired to play the role of the detective seeks out the detective for tips on how to play the role is caught by the detective on surveillance tapes and they attend a cast party as their real selves br br Despite this multiplicity of views there is no mistaking the clear lines of this narrative the playwright searches for subject matter the bomber seeks a target and the detective stalks the filmmaker Nor is there any difficulty locating Bouzaglo s ultimate target enervated and impotent Israel fully conscious of the threatening peril but incapable of meaningful action Israel is Bouzaglo the impotent fictional playwright cannibalizing his own life for his play Israel is also the bankrupt soldier entrepreneur who is the subject of the filmmaker s documentary the cheating actors and actresses and the cuckolded husband They are all Israel because they are all helpless caught in inaction or aimless action as the bomber scans the landscape for his best target All the characters can do as another bombing is reported is have sex and keep score of victims br br There is personal triumph vindication perhaps revenge at the end of this play within a story within a film but viewers will be left aching for the state of Israel even as they are filled with admiration for Bouzaglo s memorable rendition of a nation s plight within the telling of an individual s story
I have read with great interest the only available comment made before mine on this movie and I would first like to say that I understand the point of view of the previous user who commented on this movie very well viewed from an Israeli perspective I can very well imagine that this movie touches upon very sensitive issues and that the slightest detail can have a great importance for a viewer who is more or less directly concerned by the events depicted in this movie What I would like to say is that Distortion was shown at a film festival in Geneva in November 2005 Festival Cin√©ma tout √©cran where it won the award of the audience Prix du public in French For what affects me I liked the nervous camera work of Mr Bouzaglo who in my opinion portrayed an atmosphere of extreme tension and uneasiness in the movie very well and I think that most of the swiss viewers appreciated this in the movie This perspective however might seem totally alien to an Israeli viewer but not so surprising when it comes to swiss viewers because Switzerland is a country which has NEVER been subject to any terrorist attack It therefore comes as no surprise that the audience in Geneva judged this film with a much more detached perspective I would also like to quote what Mr Bouzaglo said when he was interviewed by a Geneva newspaper I m translating from French After 50 years of living here and after undergoing all this violence we may ask ourselves if it is still possible to remain normal We might sometimes think that it would be easier to commit suicide than to go on living We are like the characters in my movie on the edge of the edge This is the reason why the private detective who is somehow voyeur is the happiest character in the movie because he earns a living thanks to the system he takes advantage of this situation This is in substance the main thing that I and the swiss public in my opinion pointed out in this movie and that we did not pay attention to some inconsistencies regarding the characters in the movie which the precedent reviewer pointed out with great accuracy and humor So to sum up different country different perspective but I think that this is somehow great because it reassures me for what affects the future of cinema that is to say that it well never be subject to a unique of formatted way of thinking
The premise is simple This movies starts out looking like your average lame chick flick about two attractive young people meeting each other in an airport then things take a 180 degree turn br br I for one really dislike the kind of mind numbing love story nonsense that pollutes the average movie theater And it is my humble opinion that Wes Craven based on his previous meta horror films Sceam does too br br Following this logic it s not surprising to find that Craven sardonically takes his time to built up a nauseatingly sweet sependipity love story only to have an AWESOME Cillian Murphy wreck that whole sugar coated dreamworld br br The scope of his character Jackson Ripner Jack the Ripper get it lame right in this film is impressive he goes from being utterly charming to being a twisted nihilistic sicko which is a plus in my book As he proceeds to freak out his victim Jennifer Garner lookalike Rachel McAdams who I found pretty annoying by the way you can t help but sympathize with the guy br br This is Wes Craven embodied in Jackson Ripner through Cillian Murphy bashing all brainless chick flicks br br Mr Craven I salute you br br Best quote br br Jackson Ripner after beating the snot out of Rachel McAdams in the airplane toilet Thanks for the quickie
Rachel McAdams Cillian Murphy Wes Craven The Dream Team This is one of the best thrillers of 2005 A great plot A great twist A great eye candy This is one of Wes Craven s greatest movies apart from Scream and A Nightmare on Elm Street This could be the best The plot is one of the best things about the movie and it is very simple Lisa Reisert McAdams a struggling hotel manager boards a late Red Eye back to LA Little does she know that she has been followed by Jackson Ripner AKA Jack the Ripper Murphy They have a couple of drinks and end up sitting together on the plane Later he reveals to her that he is an assassin who was sent to kill the Secreteary of Homeland Security who is staying in Lisa s hotel And what does this have to with Lisa Well she would have to move his room to the top suite so they can bomb him if she doesn t Ripner will murder her father Brian Cox The twist and bringing of the story really gives it the extra zing and the side characters and the side jokes really add to it Overall definitely one of the best thrillers of 2005 Definitely worth the see br br 3 1 2 out of 4 stars

Great little thriller I was expecting some type of silly horror movie but what I got was tight short thriller that waste none of our time Mostof these movies we have to get into the back characters stories so we will either feel sympathy for them or hatred when people start getting killed o such foolishness here Yes you see a few characters but they really only interact with the principals Such as the husband wife at the motel whose room was canceled We saw them so we could just how efficient the Lisa character was and how inefficient the new Hotel clerk was We see the little girl simply because she will have a very small but important role later in the movie when all heck breaks loose THe Flight Atrendants because we need on in particular to move the plot ahead The bad guy in particular needs her in the beginning of the flight The rude guy in the airport was important to the movie too The only 2 characters that were just 5 liners with no use to the plot were the two young guys on the plane THat was clever because I thought they would have something to do with plot From the first scene to the last the woman character a young hotel executive named Lisa is in charge Even when Jackson shows his true colors she doesn t panic She thinks what she can do to stall time Any other movie the smart executive women would be acting like idiots But not this one It was a very short movie and I was waiting for the usual plot devices to kick in because the movie seemed to be coming to its conclusion fast Thankfuly none of them were used The new hotel clerk did not do the usual called and told her what to do which is panic drop the phone and run out of the hotel without saying anything or question your boss and tell her she had to much to drink and just dismiss her Was Craven should do more of these types of movies Also one last comment Brian Cox is in the movie but I had not one clue who he was I had to come over here to see that he is Lisa s father He is completely unrecognizable
I was bored one night and Red Eye was on and thought why not br br Red Eye is one of the best movies in a long time br br I mean I just got into the movie cause it was just so brilliant br br The story is new and different br br The movie also has two great leads in the movie with Rachel Mcadams as Lisa Reisert and Cillian Murphy as Jackson Rippner br br The acting is just brilliant and you get the feel for the people in the movie br br The music is just excellent it give you chills and can also make you feel relax br br I just love how the movie was just so well done and it never gets boring br br Red Eye is just phenomenal Nothing more and nothing less br br It s a excellent thriller br br Overall I enjoy Red Eye so much that I can watch it over and over again br br If you like Red Eye then I recommend Elektra and Cry Wolf br br I give Red Eye 9 out of 10 br br Great movie
Cillian Murphy and Rachel McAdams star in this action thriller written and directed by the master of suspense Wes Craven himself The whole movie starts with some trouble at The Lux Atlantic a hotel in Miami The problem is all fixed by Lisa Reisert the manager of the hotel Then she goes to the airport and that s where all of the trouble begins She meets Jackson Rippner who doesn t like to be called Jack because of the name Jack the Ripper if you know you him and I mean Then they board the plane and crazy enough Rippner and Reisert sit next to each other For the next half hour Lisa is terrorized tormented and terrified by Rippner I won t give anything away Then we move on to where Jack is chasing Lisa in the airport Then Lisa goes to her house to see if her father is okay and crazily enough Rippner is already there There is nearly twelve minutes of violence and strong intensity throughout that entire scene In total about 25 minutes of intense action comes at the end br br Not only was the movie intense but it had a great plot to it Like I said I will not give anything away because it s so shocking and thrilling and somewhat disturbing frightening And the acting from every single character in the movie even the ones with no lines at all were all pitch perfect It was incredible Everything was awesome in this movie The acting the music the effects the make up the directing the editing the writing everything was wonderful Wes Craven is definitely The Master of Suspense Red Eye is definitely a must see and is definitely worth spending your money on You could watch this movie over and over and over again and it would never ever get boring br br Red Eye I have to say is better than 10 out of 10 stars br br Original MPAA rating PG 13 Some Intense Sequences of Violence and Language br br My MPAA rating PG 13 Some Very Intense Sequences of Violence and Language br br My Canadian Rating 14A Violence Frightening Scenes Disturbing Content
You ll know what I mean after you ve seen Red Eye br br Overall Red Eye was a better than expected thriller It gets off to a slow start and slowly builds But by the time it was over it s a thumper br br It s hard to exactly define what makes this thriller as thrilling as I found it Except that simply put the director did a creditable job of pulling you into the action of what would otherwise have been a run of the mill plot I rather tended to forget I was watching a movie That says a lot br br Other factors I think are the closeness of victim and bad guy and that over time you begin to really relate to the victim A scant 8 out of 10 more like a 7 5 but that s pretty good
Red Eye a movie that id had wanted to see for awhile Cillian Murphy plays Jack Ripner jack the ripper a managerial pose to Assassins and his literally killer plan to knock off a highly profiled man and his family br br An everyday woman Lisa I think is a normal woman goes to work home worries hates to fly br br The death of her grandmother sends her on a flight which delayed several times br br a flight where she meets Jack an ordinary seeming guy until he suavely reveals his profession and plans which coincidentally include her in them she is the key to the Keefe s sp death br br She succeeds in saving them but nearly the cost of her life is taken Jack is beaten the Keefs are saved oh what a story laughs just kidding the movie is really good actually the best of last year there are small things that you have to pay attention to earlier in the movie that play a GREAT importance to the movie later the Frankenstein pen I watched it several times before catching all the little jokes and quirks br br a must see for thriller fans no sexual but there is a slight hint the bathroom scene jack Thanks for the quicky and the female attendant Ohhh its gonna be ONE of those flights second female attendant Hey this isn t a motel you get the idea
A very pretty red headed woman waiting for her plane meets a charming young man that she connects with As the two get on their flight and sit next to each other the young man Jack becomes deadly as he threatens Lisa to either change the room that a politician and his wife will be staying in or else have her father die See now that s what you happens when you fly coach stuff like that never happens in first class br br Other than having a conflict that takes place on a flight the other thing that this movie shares with Flightplan is the sheer unbelievability if that s a word of the story The point of the whole is to get the main character to change a politician s room so he can be assassinated which is a pretty plausible plan but won t it have being easier for Jack to just find someone that was computer savvy and have them hack into the hotel s system Teenagers today can damn near do anything with computers so I m pretty sure it would have been easier for him to simply get someone to change it using a computer instead of going through the trouble of spying on Lisa and getting her into the predicament that she lands on in the movie br br Plus one thing that struck me as odd was how no one on the plan heard a single thing they were talking about This is a very small plane were talking about here and since their voices were raised occasionally it seems to me like the other passengers should have heard something But I m 100 sure that I m reading way too much into it The movie is meant to be as realistic as an episode of 24 so one can t be perplexed by such complexities For all my complaints though this is still a very fun movie that gets the job done It s not exactly the type that requires to shut of your brain but at the same time it doesn t require great intelligence to fully enjoy br br I d love to sit here in my comfy chair and rave about the brilliant acting in the movie but really I can t I love Rachel McAdams I love Cillian Murphy and I like Brian Cox but they don t really stretch their acting muscles here It s not really much of a problem since this isn t the movie that studios hope to win multiple awards and the acting isn t the least bit horrible just not great Wes Craven isn t exactly the first that comes to mind when you think of a movie like this but he does a very nice job considering the time they had to film the movie and the lack of depth to the script It was definitely a huge improvement over the disappointing Cursed and as much as I liked him doing something different with this movie I still would love for him to go back to doing what he did in the past which is great horror movies that is talked about decades after it s release br br One nice thing about the movie which I really appreciated was just how short the movie was It is great to sit and watch a nice three hour or so movie once in a while but nowadays it s like every movie that comes out feels too long where as this movie just felt like the right length Not too long and too short They don t waste time by trying to develop the characters too much because they know this isn t the movie for that and by doing so they made a very nice short movie Being a huge film music geek I have to say that the best part of the movie is the ultra cool score by Marco Beltrami It s really nice to see Beltrami go from writing the predictable stuff to the great music he s doing now I really the cool techno orchestral stuff he does for the main titles Too bad that I can t find the soundtrack anywhere would have really loved to listen to the titles anytime I wanted instead of having to pop in the DVD when I want to hear it br br Overall It s nice for what it is and whiles it s far from great cinema should still provide for some small entertaining hour and a half
This is an excellent fast paced thriller by Wes Craven Nightmare on Elm Street who for 85 minutes leaves aside the supernatural and presents us with something even more terrifying the evil of human beings We are far more likely to encounter the benign evil of Jackson Rippner than Freddy Kruger and Cillian Murphy Batman Begins does an excellent job of presenting a sociable friendly even charismatic killer The performances by Murphy and by Rachel McAdams Claire from The Wedding Crashers are brilliant Most of the film takes place on a very intimate level between two people their eyes their faces It is action on a small scale not the broad sweep of the canvas and it is no less compelling for these limitations The cinematography is nothing special though of course one can do only so much with a camera in the confines of a passenger jet but the dialog is excellent the story taut There are no distractions no subplots confuse the issue which is at its heart a battle between the main characters By keeping his focus and avoiding distractions Wes Craven is able to take what is a very minimal plot and turning it into an exciting fast paced action thriller
Lisa is a hotel manager or owner and she gets on a flight to Miami She ends up sitting next to an assassin named Jackson who tells her that she has to switch a room of a family or her father dies The reason she has to switch the room is because Jackson wants to blow it up br br It s a great suspense movie because Lisa tries several ways to escape this ploy that Jackson has set up The whole storyline is great and I thought that they could have spent some more time on the plane There could have more to the plane but other than that the whole movie was pretty good br br I especially liked the ending because it was heart stopping I didn t know what was going to happen and I was surprised by it For me this movie just took off
I didn t want this to get complicated Leese I have to assume she s gonna read that Fear takes flight at 30 000 feet in this taut action thriller An overnight flight to Miami quickly becomes a battle for survival when Lisa Rachel McAdams realizes her seatmate Cillian Murphy is planning to use her as part of a chilling assassination plot As the minutes tick by she s in a race against time to warn the potential victims before its to late br br One of the many reasons I love this movie is because of the chemistry between the two stars McAdams and Murphy who are also two of my top favorite actors For example the early scenes at the airport play more like a romantic comedy two people keep running into each other I got to hand it to the two as well for making a film like this work Especially Murphy s character Jackson who really seems to be sort of complicated in that way that he acts charming and innocent yet he s trying to do his job and make Lisa feel trapped physically and mentally I mean in certain parts he really seems to be concerned for Lisa br br A great thrill ride all the way through A lot of films I would hate to see a prequel or a sequel about but actually I wouldn t mind a prequel to this one which would take place with Jackson surveilling Lisa Favorite scene is probably that headbutt scene because it was so unexpected There was also that nice buildup to the famous pen scene When is she going to make her move There was also that nice change in McAdam s Lisa where she changed herself from being a victim into fighting back I also loved the scene where she sits down in the food court and pretends to ask some ladies a survey about the food court How great was Murphy with his whole weezing
Red Eye is a thrilling film by the creator of Freddy Kreuger Wes Craven Wes Craven depicts the story of a regular hotel worker Lisa After attending the funeral of her grandmother she decides to take the red eye flight During waiting she meets this man named Jack Rippner how fffrreeaakkyy is that and they sort of become friends Ironically both sit right next to each other on this plane Then this is when the horror starts This movie is thrilling and to the weak hearted people who don t like thrilling horror films well lets say that its possible that they might pee in their pants This is an excellent example of a bone shaking production Wes Craven did well with this film He chose the right actors like Rachel McAdams an intelligent sexy girl who knows what she s doing and is cautious of everything when she s acting in a film Cillian Murphy the scary and horrifying actor who can chill your bones at his amazing acting being the bad character in this film and his face can really widen your eyes Wes Craven did an excellent job and I hope that he makes more films like this one
Red Eye is a good little thriller to watch on a Saturday night Intense acting great villain and unexpected action br br Some might not want to see this movie because it goes for a very short 85 Min s and 88 of the movie is on a plane and just talking Don t worry they pull it off very well with the smart and witty dialog br br A PG 13 movie seems to be new grounds for director Wes Craven But surely enough he has fit as much violence as he possibly can into this thriller br br This movies strongest point is its cast This film needed good actors to deliver the dialog and thrills If they didn t have those actors the film would have been lost and boring We had Rachel McAdams from Mean Girls and Wedding Crashers Cillian Murphy from Batman Begins and 28 days Later Rounding off this cast is Brian Cox from X men 2 br br The pacing in this film was great Just when your thinking its going to get boring they throw a twist at you Luckily this isn t a long movie and doesn t feel like it either Much better then the other flight movie Flight Plan br br Here is my Flight Plan comment http www imdb com title tt0408790 usercomments 578 br br I recommend Not too long and not too shabby br br 8 10
Red Eye starts in Texas where hotel receptionist Lisa Reisert Rachel McAdams is about to catch the last red eye flight back to Miami where she lives works While waiting for her plane Lisa meets the handsome charming Jackson Rippner Cillian Murphy they both seem to hit it off then when they board the plane they discover that by a coincidence they are seated next to each other Once the plane takes off they are in the air Jackson reveals who he really is that their seemingly chance meeting was not a coincidence Jackson says that he is working for someone who wants to assassinate the homeland security secretary Charles Keefe Jack Scalia they need her to change his rooms at the hotel where she works in Miami Jackson tells Lisa to phone the hotel make it happen or her father will be killed br br Directed by Wes Craven who is perhaps better known for his horror films such as The Last House on the Left 1972 A Nightmare on Elm Street 1984 The Serpent and the Rainbow 1989 The People Under the Stairs 1991 the Scream trilogy of teen slashers a short punchy fast paced little thriller like Red Eye seems like a big departure from the sort of film Craven usually makes The script by Carl Ellsworth makes for a surprisingly gripping thriller that I must admit I really enjoyed at only 85 odd minutes in length it s a very quick moving economical straight to the point sort of film that focuses almost entirely on one tight taught plot rather than go off in various directions with lots of subplots Some may like this approach like I did while other s may not but I think it draws you into the action a lot more as it comes thick fast without the film slowing down any giving you a chance to relax I really liked the plot for Red Eye sure a film like this is always going to have one or two questionable moments in terms of plotting but what the hell it s a film made to entertain for me that s what it did I really liked the two central character s Lisa comes across as very likable while Jackson Rippner an obvious play on the name of the notorious Victorian serial killer Jack the Ripper is a suitably slimy villain with a cold I m only doing my job type mentality Another plus point is that I didn t think anyone behaved overly stupid here everyone actually seemed like human beings the films plays out in a relatively plausible fashion I really liked this it s one of Craven s better more recent films br br Craven turns in a good solid tense tight taught fast paced thriller with an attractive cast some good action a gripping plot He certainly doesn t hang about once he starts the action tension he never lets up far away the most effective part of the film is when Rippner is holding Lisa hostage on the plane once the film switches to Miami Lisa s fathers house it does become a little bit more routine but it s still good A special mention goes to Rachel McAdams who is absolutely gorgeous in this I could probably watch Red Eye again just because she is in it looks drop dead stunning Those who see Wes Craven s name attached to Red Eye expecting a horror film should think again since there s no horror in it at all despite the IMDb listing Horror as Red Eye s genre I am not sure about the ending on the one hand it was nice to see the villain live for a change which goes against traditional expectation but it might have been more satisfying to see Lisa kill him in some way br br DreamWorks apparently gave Red Eye an initial budget of 44 000 000 but reduced it to 25 000 000 although it s still a very well made film with glossy production values Actually shot in Los Angeles Florida in California The film was supposedly written with husband wife Sean Penn Robin Wright Penn intended for the leads but eventually the makers opted for younger leads As I have already said Rachel McAdams is pure eye candy is a total babe in this worth watching the film for on her own Oh she puts in a decent performance too br br Red Eye is a really fast paced taught tension filled little thriller that I enjoyed immensely I didn t think I would enjoy it as much as I did I am glad I decided to watch it This definitely gets a recommendation from me Rachel McAdams really is hot stuff in this
Greetings again from the darkness What a relief a thriller that actually is thrilling New IT girl Rachel McAdams Wedding Crashers and The Notebook dominates screen time in this nice little classic suspense thriller from famed horror film director Wes Craven Scream movies and A Nightmare on Elm Street Craven even has a cameo as one of the passengers on the plane br br What makes this one work is the realism of the first 15 20 minutes as we see McAdams interact with 4 or 5 people either in person or on the phone She is a natural When she meets Cillian Murphy the Scarecrow in Batman Begins in what appears to be happenstance the film really takes flight Watching the two yuppie types flirt while the audience knows something evil is brewing is bewitching film making The plane boarding sequence is mesmerizing and the 30 plus minutes onboard is excruciatingly claustrophobic Craven keeps us guessing as to the involvement of others and if anyone will come to her rescue br br As with many thrillers the only letdown occurs during the climax when the lamb turns into a superhero An interesting plot device leads us to believe little Rachel has the necessary pent up frustration to see this through but we can t help but cringe a bit The most overdone scenes involve irate hotel guests an annoying airline passenger Cillian s injury and the FX at the hotel The strength of the film is in the character development and psychological games between the leads Sadly the fine screen veteran Brian Cox is under utilized but overall this is an above average suspense thriller worth seeing for all but the finale
Red Eye is not the kind of movie that s going to win the Palme D or but Wes Craven has never been that kind of director anyway and his branding is a good indication of what a film goer can expect br br The fact that Red Eye is a tight little undemanding package at 94 minutes is part of its charm and an indication of Craven s craft in producing lightweight but generally enjoyable box office fare In fact it s the perfect kind of movie to show as inflight entertainment attention holding without putting any intellectual or emotional challenges on the viewer br br Overall there is a cheesy feeling to the plot vague terrorist subplot motivation and the supporting characters and the main section has a TV movie feel However there are definite elements of Hitchcockian suspense and echoes of Schumacher s Phone Booth which ultimately is a more sophisticated and pretentious play on the same idea of emotional crisis being played out suppressed in public br br For a film that focuses mainly on two people sitting in airline seats it lives or dies on the characters and script Cillian s icy but eloquent Jackson Rippner and Rachel MacAdams resourceful Lisa are the main reasons the film gets carried off Not only making the dialogue zing but also giving some sort of Adam s Rib type dimension to their battle of male logic against feminine sensitivity br br In the final portion of the film Craven indulges himself a little Scream style as man chases girl with knife The most surprising revelation here is what Brian Cox looks like after the Just for Men treatment his ubiqutous appearance in films as diverse as Super Troopers The Ring and this making him the sexegenarian version of Jude Law br br Short haul fun
I also just got back from an advanced screening of Redeye and I must say I haven t had so much fun at a movie in a long time WES CRAVEN is at his best ever He brings us an amazing end of summer thriller I was so desperately craving This is THE thriller of the year no doubt br br All the actors are amazing and the action is realistic and fun The F X were great It steadily built suspense I was on the edge of my seat most of the movie It s been a while since I heard an audience cheer and clap and get excited in a theater br br If your looking for thrills action and a GOOD plot this summer REDEYE delivers Go see it
On an overnight flight from Los Angeles to Miami Lisa Reisert Rachel McAdams meets a charming man who turns out to be a hired killer who demands her help killing a businessman or else her own father will die br br Red Eye is a terrific thriller that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats The premise is similar to Cellular and Phone Booth but Red Eye is better than both of those films Almost everything about Red Eye is above average including the suspense the acting and the direction Most of the film does take place on a plane but that doesn t slow down the movie The film is very fast pace and exciting with no slow or boring spots Wes Craven does a really good job behind the camera Instead of focusing on the thrills he focuses on the story and the characters The movie does have its share of suspenseful moments but that s not what the film is really about I also like the way Wes Craven focuses on the other passengers and the small details that become important later on Red Eye really shows his skills at storytelling br br Red Eye also works well because of its young and talented cast Rachel McAdams gives a very engaging performance and her character is hard to hate You may even end up cheering for her out loud Cillian Murphy gives a very creepy and effective performance as the villain The way he acts charming at first but then turns psycho is especially impressive The supporting actors are also pretty good which include Brain Cox and Jayma Mays br br The movie is also very stylish and it has this overall creepy vibe to it The setting works well since there is an obvious fear of isolation and no escape Overall the tone of the film is consistently creepy The screenplay isn t as strong as everything else though There are a few unrealistic moments that may distract the viewer Most of them didn t bother me but there were of few that left me shaking my head Also the ending is disappointing It isn t a bad ending just a very simple one and a different approach would have been better Since the movie focuses on the characters there is really no scream moments maybe just a few jumps If you expect a horror movie then you will end up disappointed In the end Red Eye is an engaging thriller and it s one of the best movies of the summer Rating 8 10
Beautifully filmed well acted tightly scripted suspense movie Had me on the edge of my seat I liked the lead actress very much and thought the villain was very well done Not much to chew on here in the way of a theme but if you just get in your seat turn your brain off watch the fancy camera work and enjoy the plot you will have a great time The plot is well worn and regular movie goers will probably know more or less what to expect by about ten minutes in But that didn t bother me as I enjoyed watching it unfold In the old days they might not have focused so tightly on just two characters and there were some enticing moments when I hoped they were going to let some other people have a few lines But these folks were probably right to keep the movie so tightly focused The plot got me by the throat fairly early on and never let go It s not a good idea to think too much either during or after the movie as I m not sure it makes a great deal of sense Just sit back and enjoy
Scream was Wes Craven s last decent thriller Since then there has been nothing but an unbearable streak of Hollywood trash barely good enough for a blockbuster night including the disappointment of the Scream sequels Perhaps the genius and the craftsmanship devoted to the movie drained all the energy and creativity out of him so that when it came time for supper he had nothing to serve us but his own doo doo Finally after who knows how many bad movies later he gives us a delicious ruthless gripping chilling suspense thriller with Red Eye br br Rachel McAdams once again delivers an enjoyable performance as she plays a hotel manager who has the unfortunate connection with an important political figure and regular at her hotel Then she meets Jackson Ripner Cillian Murphy Batman Beyond at the airport who she gets to know a little better after a delayed flight and a bay breeze What she doesn t know is he already knows her And he also knows her father who she will never see again if she fails to cooperate and meet Jackson s demands to use her connections to set up her hotel regular for assassination br br You re probably thinking this is nothing but your everyday thriller complete with predictability and chase scenes Although this is a good old fashioned thriller that s the beauty of it No special effects No cheap make up Just classic suspense You feel the desperation and regret with every decision McAdams is forced to make and you actually care for her as you cheer her on every move she makes to find an escape from her claustrophobic position br br As always she delivers an entertaining and convincing performance It s either her sweet face or her uncanny ability to sincerely cry but you always seem to sympathize with her if her role demands it Cillian Murphy on the other hand is naturally creepy looking so even if the trailer didn t reveal it his ultimate transition from charming stranger to merciless jackass isn t so surprising Perhaps it would have been more trippy to see a nice guy persona like Toby Maguire transforming into evil relentless madman Nevertheless Cillian Murphy after his true identity is established played the role so solidly you d really want him to die or at least get his ass kicked br br Don t overlook this feature There are plenty of chalkboard screeching moments and heart jumpers that will keep your eyes on the screen instead of your watch like you would at Craven s recent pictures If not for the you do it for all the times you ll see your girlfriend or boyfriend or someone with popcorn jump and cling on to you Wes finally gets it right Aside from his trademark mastery in suspense Red Eye is not without its humor as McAdams replacement Cynthia at the front desk fumbles to keep the hotel in order It was a relief that Red Eye wasn t a disappointment Instead you ll get the pleasure of seeing McAdams deliver another incredibly talented performance Murphy look creepier by the minute and Craven craft a classic traditional thriller A flight that was delayed and would have been the beginning of Craven s renaissance had it arrived right after Scream
I had fun watching Red Eye It s not a masterpiece but it s well directed and structured Cillian Murphy and Rachel McAdams are perfect in the role Yes it s the same old story with a different setting but Wes Craven gave it a good pace At least not another Scream with the usual college killer It s nice when you can see a clean coherent thriller even when originality doesn t stand out as its main character Particularly from a film maker like Craven that has brought so many innovative ideas to the thriller and horror genre in the past and that now just lends himself to bringing home what could have been a good TV movie had it not been released theatrically Good job
I saw an advanced screening for this movie tonight I absolutely loved it The movie kept me on the edge of my seat all night Cillian Murphy is extremely creepy as the villain For those of you who have seen Batman Begins his character was much scarier in this film He played his character very well The scariest bad guy I have seen in awhile Rachel McAdams was great Everyone in the audience laughed gasped and cheered at the same time as if we were on cue The suspense is held through out the movie THe amazing part is that the end was not anti climatic I was not disappointed in the end I felt satisfied The trailer does not do the movie justice The movie is much better than the trailer indicated Do not wait for this movie to come out on video Go see it Although I did not have to pay to see this movie I would have gladly given 10 75 to see it Enjoy
What I liked best in this film is that like the films of Hitchcock it is a thriller that does not take itself too seriously br br Hitchcock understood that people go the the movies to have a good time Something that Hollywood seems to have forgotten in recent years This is a thriller but it has plenty of laughs and always has one eye winking at the camera br br Rachel McAdams is wonderful as always Cillian Murphy is creepier than he was in Batman Begins In the old days there were guys who always played the bad guy We don t see much of that these days because I suspect the Hollywood agents consider it a bad career move but Cillian Murphy is really good at being bad br br The directing is surprising stylish The story is good but the dialog could have used some sprucing up br br Red Eye is a really fun film and people were applauding when the closing credits started rolling If you are in the mood for an enjoyable escapist thriller Red Eye might be your ticket
I just caught an episode about Brad the crack cocaine addict who turned to a drug addicted life on the streets after his bicycle racing career went to shambles as fast as it started I have to say that the story about his biking career was more heart breaking than his drug addiction Here s this young guy who is winning bike races left and right and is invited to train with an Olympic training team for two weeks and immediately upon arriving he insults Lance Armstrong one of the greatest athletes who ever lived and is generally callous and unfriendly to everyone in general Understandably he is soon asked to leave Most of the show is about his struggle with addiction and how he got his life back but what I wanted to know was what was wrong with him in the first place to make his act like such an ass br br At any rate I was confused about how the show was put together since it shows Brad at the height of his addiction We see footage of him pan handling and sleeping in gutters and ditches and even smoking crack cocaine I didn t even know that was legal to show but why would a camera crew just follow him around and film that Do they do that in hopes that this guy will turn his life around and give them some material for a good TV episode br br At any rate it is an enlightening show because it shows the effects of various addictions and the total control that they can take over people s lives Sometimes it s hard to watch because you really see how badly the families and friends suffer in the face of the addict s indifference although I have to admit that at the end it all seems a little too clean cut There are times during the episodes when terrible things happen and everything seems lost but still and maybe I should warn about spoilers here everything has a little too much of a happily ever after feel at the end and I have a feeling that that is a very uncommon occurrence in real life But still it s a show about people trying to help other people and you can never complain too much about something like that
Intervention has helped me with my own addictions and recovery I m a middle aged married father of two I m quite functional in my personal and professional life Still I have pain from my past that I use addictions to soothe and issues from which I am slowly recovering When these addicts and their families share their lives with me they help me to improve my life and my relationship with my family br br The show unlike many others digs into the past of the addict and reveals events that probably caused their addiction Many of us suffer because it s too scary to go back and do as Alice Miller says the discovery and emotional acceptance of the truth in the individual and unique history of our childhood The show deserves a lot of credit for at least getting this process started This digging is painful and difficult but worth it So much coverage of addiction fictional and non fictional seems to ignore the underlying issues Often it s assumed that the addict just one day started to shoot up or whatever for fun or pleasure or self interest and now they can t stop Not so addictions are about killing pain I can relate to the different events and hardships in people s lives There are common themes and surprising exceptions Many addicts have suffered miserable abuse Some kids simply respond badly to divorce To those who think that addiction is an over reaction to a hardship I would just say that different people respond differently Although some kids handle divorce well others like Cristy in the show collapse in a heap on the floor and have their lives forever changed by the event br br For example last night s counselor said that pretty young Andrea seeks validation from men She strips for cash for a 75 year old neighbor and lets men abuse her Sound familiar to anyone The series is filled with information that we can use to understand our own motivations and make adjustments to our lives Often it s those of us with smaller issues who suffer the longest As they say even a stopped watch is right twice a day but a slow watch can go undetected for quite a while until it s made your life miserable br br To the producers Thank you for making the show for digging into the past for the follow ups Also the graphics the format and the theme music are brilliant br br To the addicts thank you for your courage to share Whether or not you have helped yourself you have helped me
I find I enjoy this show but the format needs some work First off the good attributes I like how this show will take us through the day to day life of an addict because the producers have a knack at getting the addict to show us how bad they ve allowed their lives to become This is followed by an intervention which is then followed by an outcome Intervention doesn t candy coat things and sometimes the outcome often short term due to the constraints of time between filming and airing is a negative outcome This makes the positive outcomes all the better br br Another thing I like about the show is the quality of the camera work Given the reality that these cameramen have to squeeze anywhere and don t have the benefit of re shooting scenes the photography is surprisingly good and stable It s actually superior to scripted shows like The Shield where the photography is so bad it can induce nausea br br Now for the bad An episode will sometimes contain two completely different and unrelated cases that will be mixed together during the show You ll get caught up in the story of one addict then suddenly you re thrown into the story of another Get caught up in that story then suddenly you re back to the first addict or are you By now you may have forgotten which case the individual currently on screen belong to This constant flip flopping between addicts really gets disruptive during the intervention scenes because the show will even mix together the two completely unrelated interventions I once heard the marketing B S reason for this poor design The show can get so intense that switching to another addict allows the viewer time to absorb what they re watching Oh please Clearly the reason this is done is because they have two cases that aren t big enough for an hour show so they mix two together By mixing them instead of giving each a half hour block like they should it forces the viewer to watch the entire thing and the commercials if they are interested in one case but not the other br br I used to find these blender episodes so annoying that I d only tell my TiVo to record episodes containing one addict but then it became easier just to record all of them
This show is awesome I have been a fan since it premiered and it only keeps me watching I ve seen some terrible things here that I wish I hadn t BUT it really shows you how addiction affects all involved not just the addict You can see all kinds of different addictions from drugs and alcohol to the shopping addict or the eating disorder addict And actually it s really sad to see some of the famous faces that have come through also We ve seen accomplished musicians an NBA player and even young people who really need the help And since they have started showing a few follow ups that s been awesome too Now you can see how they are a long while after their ep aired If you haven t checked this one out please do It s on A E and it s awesome The new eps are Sunday nights at 10PM EST if I remember correctly so set your TiVo
I was on France around March 05 and I love to go to this Film Festivals I knew about this Cin√©mas d Am√©rique Latine de Toulouse but I ve never went to it I decided to go and then I caught Cero y van 4 br br The film is stunning It doesn t caused the impact on me like with the Mexican users because it was french subtitled but it s still shocking br br This film is a satire about urban violence about kidnapping and crime on the streets in Mexico It is a crude portrait of the city Of a Metropolis Secuestro Express with a stunning Mia Maestro which was also a satire of kidnapping almost but with a more serious tone has and I think so some kinda connection with Cero y van 4 A sort of redemption story and that how much is too much Man on Fire that was stunningly strong was also not a satire but a crude portrait into the streets of Mexico Or it is like The Brave One A film that shocks and hits you in the guts very hard This is like The Usual Suspects it has some plot twists and turns but that makes it even more believable Verdict A film that shocks and makes you believe that there s no security on the streets anymore Stunning dialogue impressive direction and astonishing performances Cero y van 4 is a film that you won t forget soon Leaves you shaking and stunned
This movie even though is about one of the most favorite topics of Mexican producers producers the extreme life in our cities has a funny way to put it on the screen br br Four of the more important Mexican directors of the last times approach histories of our city framed in diverse literary sorts as it can be the farce or the satire which gives us a film with a over exposed topic in our country but narrated in a very different way which gives a freshness tone him br br With actors little known but that interprets of excellent way their paper each one of the directors reflect in the stories the capacity by we have been identified anywhere in the world that capacity of laugh the pains and to make celebration of the sadness Perhaps to many people in our country the film not have pleased but I consider that people of other countries could find attractive and share the surrealism of the Mexican
I can give you four reasons to see this movie br br 1 Four of the best filmmakers in the contemporary Mexican cinema br br 2 Four good stories related into a big scheme br br 3 A surprisingly good cast br br 4 A bitter reflexion about the biggest trouble in this country and many others br br POSSIBLE SPOILERS br br Alejandro Gamboa opens this movie with a good story in a comedic mood about the authority practicing the extortion against regular people and still expecting to be appreciated by its efforts br br Then Antonio Serrano gets more dramatic in the second piece with a story heir to the Italian neorealism with a Peter and the wolf like anecdote br br In the third story the one that seems more independent from this series even in the context Carlos Carrera tells us the story of a man being at the wrong place in the wrong moment But after the recent lynching at Tlahuac and the tradition in this awful matter at the State of Mexico this story couldn t be more updated br br And at the end Fernando Sari√±ana returns to the dark humor in the grand finale in which he puts together the most of the characters from the past sequences in one of the better comedy pieces ever filmed Reprising the center scene from one of his previous films Todo el poder Sari√±ana gives the final lesson of the theme And by the way give us the scene that steals the movie with Anna Ciochetti making a brief striptease br br Once the movie has ended you get a bittersweet feeling about having looked at a good movie and maybe enjoyed it with a very painful subject They say that in Mexico people laugh at their own disgrace and this is the best example This film is a testimony of how Mexicans have learn to live in the middle of a crime state and perhaps accepted it between two fires The criminals and the so called authorities full of corruption Even this movie is a wishful thinking because almost all the good people have been a victim of crime and they don t get this unhurt If you had an assault without a scratch then you re lucky Meanwhile don t lose the chance to see this movie highly recommended br br And it s a beautiful life in Mexico
There are people claiming this is another bad language ultra violence Mexican movie They are right but more than that this film is a call to create awareness of what we have become The awful truth hurts or bores when you already have accepted the paradigm of living the third world as the only possible goal One of the most important things of Cero y van cuatro is the open invitation to profound reflexion over our current identity Is that what we all are Is that all that we want to be I am abroad and I realized how spoiled is the Mexican society when the Tlahuac Incident came to light I still cannot understand viewers witnessing a mass broadcasted murder I nearly puked when I saw some of the images It was not Irak or Rwanda just a tiny village near Mexico City when rampage was carried out with the indulgence of media and government The recreation of a similar situation in this film shocked me deeply The other stories were good portraying other situations of corruption dishonesty betrayal and violence but I consider Tamales de Chivo the best one br br The movie is deeper than some cabr√≥n and pendejo screams Those are meaningless compared with the actions of the people With a few exceptions they are all perfect examples of human rubbish Just like in real life honesty is becoming more the exception than the rule in our country Moreover honesty is only rewarded miraculously
What an absolutely stunning movie if you have 2 5 hrs to kill watch it you won t regret it it s too much fun Rajnikanth carries the movie on his shoulders and although there isn t anything more other than him I still liked it The music by A R Rehman takes time to grow on you but after you heard it a few times you really start liking it
A most awaited film of the year 2002 After three and half years of hibernation Rajini has acted in this movie The hype for this film was toooooo high br br This is not a typical Rajini film in this film he gives some spiritual messages also But it also includes typical Rajini actions style songs etc Its a good entertaining movie and gives good messages also br br I will rate this movie as Good instead of Excellent because of the screenplay Its a must watch movie Dont miss it
WHEN FRIENDSHIP KILLS in my opinion is a very touching and kind of heartbreaking drama about the consequences of being anorexic or bulimic Anytime Lexi Katie Wright or Jennifer Marley Shelton threw up I wanted to vomit myself It s kind of hard to explain why If you ask me they should have been more cooperative about things However I did enjoy seeing them do things together as well as get lectured by their parents Before I wrap this up I d like to say If you ask me WHEN FRIENDSHIP KILLS does indeed show you how being anorexic or bulimic can affect a person s body Now in conclusion I recommend this movie to everyone who hasn t seen it You re in for some tears and a good time so the next time it s on TV kick back with a friend and watch it
I came across this film by accident when listing all the films I wanted my sister to record for me whilst I was on holiday and I am so glad that I included this one It deals with issues that most directors shy away from my only problem with this film is that it was made for TV so I couldn t buy a copy for my friend br br It s a touching story about how people with eating disorders don t necessarily shy away from everyone and how many actually have dieting buddies It brought to my attention that although bulimics can maintain a fairly stable weight it has more serious consequences on their health that many people are ignorant of
Lexi befriends Jennifer a thin intelligent girl at her new school Lexi s parents have just split up Soon Jen tells Lexi of her eating disorder and the two begin dieting and exercising together They both are in the school s volley ball team Lexi s mum becomes aware of her daughter s illness as she is losing lots of weight Lexi is admitted to hospital She is diagnosed with Anorexia nervosa and is made to gain weight Her father visits her in hospital and orders a feeding tube She is better and is allowed out of hospital and she tells her mum that Jen has bulimia This leads to the two falling out as Lexi s mum tells Jen s mum her suspicions br br At a party Jen is hit by a car and because her heart is weak it kills her Lexi s condition worsens as she blames herself for her best friend s death
I agree with the above comment I love the realism in this and in many movies not just movies on eating disorders the producers seem to forget that They take an every day problem and create a hugely dramatic scene and then come the end of the movie everything is perfect again which I dislike because its not reality Not meaning to say things can t get better and not meaning to say things don t in this movie but it doesn t spend most of the movie creating all these problems and come the end of the movie everything is perfect again When people have eating disorders people don t just admit it and want to get better and then life is peachy it takes time and I like how in this movie we grow with the characters we go through the difficulties with them getting better and worse because it is a very important part of the movie It gets into the minds of people with eating disorders and shows the complications and pain in a very realistic way and I loved that I also love how it shows The secrecy and betrayal people feel when suffering from eating disorders it is scary to see how people react when they find out especially if they approve of it I thought this movie was very touching and beautiful and well told and defiantly one of my favourites
There are way too many subjects avoided in cinema and eating disorders is one of them This film shows it as it is It is not glamourised for the viewers to enjoy it is shown with real truth which makes it all the more powerful I ve only seen it once and that was a few years ago but i can still remember everything about it and how it made me feel It is a very powerful film and is good support for anyone suffering from a eating disorder to give them the willpower to stop This is what films should be about they should be there to help people and not glamourise things that are wrong
I have seen a couple movies on eating disorders but this one was definitely my favorite one The problem with the other ones was that the people with the eating disorders towards the end just automatically get better or accept the fact that they need help and thats it this movie I thought was more realistic cause in this one the main character Lexi doesn t automatically just get better She gets better and then has a drawback I think this movie shows more than the others that I ve seen that getting better doesn t just happen it s hard work and takes time it s a long path to recovery I think this movie shows all of that very well There should be more movies like this
The surprise nominee of this year s Best Animated Feature race at the Oscars It s an Irish film by heart but it was co produced by Belgium and Brazil with I m guessing animators working in all three countries The product is one of the most beautiful and unique films in recent memory The character design is a little reminiscent of the French animated film Persepolis from a couple of years back with very simple characters with thick black outlines This film is not in black and white Oh no What makes this film great is its use of color simply some of the most outrageous and startling use of colors I ve ever seen The general design of the pictures is also a lot more geometrical with characters who are basically rectangles or ovals Much of the film can be spent playing find the circle a major aspect of the visual design is a circle in the center of the image All of these geometrical designs have a purpose the story is about a young boy who is learning to be an artist working on illuminated manuscripts the Book of Kells is a real illuminated Bible the art of the film is based on the drawings in it The story of the film isn t especially deep but it s a pretty good fantasy tale Brendan is a young boy in Kells a city surrounded by enormous walls built by his uncle to keep out Vikings A newcomer to Kells Brother Aiden inspires Brendan to take up illustrating He also inspires him to do things like leave Kells and explore the nearby forest within which lives a nymph Bruno Coulais provides a fantastic score almost as good as the one he did for Coraline which I consider the very best of the year
First animated feature film from Ireland is also one of the best animated films I ve ever seen Its a real warts and all story that is unlike any of the other Oscar nominees and any other film from this year or any other year br br The plot of the film has the Abbot of Kells a village in Ireland building a wall around his town to prevent the vikings from destroying the town should they ever attack His nephew Brendon is a young monk who does the best he can but meets the ire of his uncle by doing things in his own time When a legendary illuminator Aidan arrives from a destroyed monastery Brendon drifts towards him and his warm personality Much to his uncle s chagrin Aiden offers to teach Brendon how to illuminate In order to help Aidan work on his great book saved from his destroyed monastery Brendan goes out into the forest to get material to make ink While outside the walls he meets Ashley a forest spirit with whom he develops a friendship Unfortunately the Abbot finds out that he went outside the wall and there is hell to pay But lurking in the distance are the vikings br br Forget what you think you know about this film you re wrong Even what I ve explained doesn t do this film justice Its a simple story with so much more going on This is a wonderful movie about trying to find your way in the world over coming demons and finding the beauty of the world outside of the walls As the film says the world is a dangerous place and doesn t cease to be even if you build walls br br Its a film that treats its audience as adults and deals with all of life including the darkness There is death and destruction and joy and happiness Its not sugar coated People die Monsters lurk it freaked out some of the kids but in the end there is hope Frankly the darkness in this film is completely unlike anything in any recent American film Forget the sadness in a Pixar film this is the real thing and its refreshing and it shows how homogenized even Pixar has become br br Its a Genndy Tartakovsky esquire Samurai Jack animated film who s look is actually based upon the the Celtic art of the period Its a film that looks unlike any other Here again is another film that takes the movie frame and uses it in every way possible the Images are designed to fill the available space as much as possible Often the film manipulated things to make it look like a page in the legendary Book of Kells Its stunningly beautiful and best described as art come to life br br Director Tomm Moore has fashioned a film that is a masterpiece I can t say more than that Its a masterpiece Its one of the best animated films I ve ever run across
This animated feature a co production between Ireland Belgium and France deals with what is surely one of the oddest subject ever for a movie the creation in the 9th century of a famous illuminated manuscript the book of Kells In this fantastic retelling of that story a prepubescent boy named Brendan living in a monastery ruled by his uncle a stern abbot who is worried preparing the defenses of the abbey from the impending attack by the feared vikings must get into the forbidding surrounding forest to find the materials that a master illuminator named Aidan needs to finish the book To do that task in the forest he unexpectedly finds the help of a friendly fairy named Aisling Gorgeously and delicately drawn by hand there is some computer animation in a few key passages in a manner that wants to resemble both medieval and traditional Celtic art and with a very creative use of color and all sorts of geometric shapes this film is relentlessly strange but is a good strange not of the off putting variety but of the eye opening sort If one were to nitpick beyond some anachronisms like an African monk in 9th century Ireland one would have to say that the blend of Catholic mysticism with Celtic paganism in this movie never really coalesce And the comic relief is sometimes a bit too broad That s why I cannot give them the highest ranking But these are minor problems with an otherwise delightful and superbly imaginative film
A beautiful piece of children s cinema buried in a world of archaic Celticism Setting the story around the famous Book of Kels believed to have been comprised by monks from the small island of Iona off the western coast of Scotland br br Telling the tale of a young abbots apprentice who goes off into the forest in search of Crom Cruic the fierce headless horseman of pagan mythology In hopes of recovering a lost artefact br br The films true beauty lies in its animation Cell shaded in a bright and inspirational style of deep complexity resulting in a look of seem less simplicity Deriving much from the artistic style of the brilliant Cartoon Network series Samurai Jack for its genius use of mark making and background depth The Secret of Kels creates a consistently affective Celtic world living under the shadow of Viking invasion br br The history may be intensely inaccurate and the ways of life portrayed lacking realism but these facts are utterly irrelevant as the film sets itself in a world of fantasy and Celtic revivalist mysticism The girl of the forest is a wonderful addition and in my opinion makes the picture what it is as she glides from branch to branch Appearing and disappearing like a mysterious nymph with qualities resembling the legendary Cheshire Cat from Alice and Wonderland br br The Secret of Kels is an absolute treat For all genders all ages it s a lovely piece of family cinema br br Don t expect to be awed but instead pleasantly impressed
While watching this movie I was frustrated and distracted and by the end I wanted to give the movie a solid 4 or 5 I thought the animation was random and all over the place and there was too much going on Even my A D D couldn t keep up It felt like a slight acid trip Everything looked flat there was no dimension to anything There were so many shapes lines and patterns I really wanted to stop the movie mid way and smash my burned copy of this movie But after I finish watching it I went online to read up on the movie and I should have done a little research into this movie before watching br br The Secret of Kells is loosely based on the true story about the original Book of Kells A small boy Brendan is given the task of penning new pages in what is set to be the greatest book ever written This book will contain information that will help change darkness into light Brendan lives in the village of Kells behind huge stone walls Taking place in the 8th century Brendan s uncle the Abbot of Kells is trying to build the wall to keep the Vikings out Brendan s uncle insist he help complete the wall but a traveler and keeper of the book secretly trains Brendan to hone in on his illustration skills and convinces him to complete the book and carry out it s word br br The entire time I watched the movie I thought I was missing something because I didn t really understand what was going on I figured I was just missing a piece of Irish history A simple Google search taught me all I needed to know about the original Book of Kells After reading many articles my opinion of the movie greatly changed br br The Book of Kells is a copied version of the first few books of the New Testament transcribed into Latin by Gaelic monks in Ireland in the 8th century Along with it s paleographic and insular script the book is also beautifully illustrated in insular art a type of early art form know for it s intricacy complexity and miniature illustrations Much of the art in the Book of Kells is depicted as lots of art was at the time flat and dimensionality challenged with no perspective But what makes the Book of Kells stand out from other early pieces of art is it s use of many colors br br The Secret of Kells is very colorful I originally thought the animation was flat and boring It reminded me a lot of the cartoon Samurai Jack which also had a flat and amine look to it Once I learned about the art styles of the Book of Kells it s obvious that many of the styles from the book are mimicked in the movie There are lines and swirls and various shapes that inhabit Brendan s mind Whenever he goes into his imagination circular shapes resembling the sun cogs clocks and wheels begin filling the screen The edges of the screen become framed in decorated moving triangles or circles Transitions are filled with color and Celtic knots From the trees to the floors many things in this world are covered in shapes or patterns br br Clocking in at 70 minutes minus credits The Secret of Kells is a fun little history lesson with a little adventure and silliness thrown in to keep people maybe just children interested I think one has to generally be open mined to The Secret of Kells as half art piece half movie about history Despite looking like it was animated with Adobe illustrator It s a very nice looking movie But based on the 20 films submitted for Oscar consideration I don t think it was worth being nominated over Mary and Max br br ThatWasJunk Blogspot com
The Secret of Kells is one of the most unique beautiful and eye popping animated films I have ever seen Before watching this film I was convinced that nothing could give Up a run for its money and that it was a shoo in to win in this category but I found in Kells a serious contender br br The Secret of Kells tell the story of a young orphan named Brendan who lives with his uncle the Abbot of Kell The Abbot is a loving guardian but perhaps a bit too strict and much more concerned with fortifying the wall around the town from a coming attack by vikings than he is at nurturing the boy s imagination When the legendary Brother Aidan who looks surprisingly like Willie Nelson shows up and takes the boy under his wing Brendan goes on a journey into the woods and meets a lovely forest nymph named Aisling who takes a liking to him and saves his life more than once With Aisling s help he attempts to save the town and help Brother Aidan complete the mystical book which legend has it can turn dark into light br br See my full review of The Secret of Kells at http theoscarsblog blogspot com 2010 02 movie review secret of kells html
The Secret of Kells is an independent animated feature that gives us one of the fabled stories surrounding the Book of Kells an illuminated manuscript from the Middle Ages featuring the four Gospels of the New Testament I didn t know that this book actually exists but knowing it now makes my interpretation and analysis much a lot easier There are a few stories and ideas floating around about how the book came to be who wrote it and how it has survived over 1 000 years This is one of them br br We are introduced to Brendan an orphan who lives at the Abbey of Kells in Ireland with his uncle Abbot Cellach voiced by Brendan Gleeson Abbot Cellach is constructing a massive wall around the abbey to protect the villagers and monks Brendan is not fond of the wall and neither are the other monks They are more focused on reading and writing something Abbot Cellach does not have time for anymore He fears the Northmen those who plunder and leave towns and villages empty and burnt to the ground br br One day a traveler comes from the island of Iona near Scotland It is Brother Aidan a very wise man who carries with him a special book that is not yet finished Abbot Cellach grants him permission to stay and Brendan buddies up with him Aidan has special plans for Brendan First he needs ink for the book but he requires specific berries The only way to get them is to venture outside the walls and into the forest an area off limits to Brendan Seeing that he is the only chance for Aidan to continue his work he decides to sneak out and return with the berries before his uncle notices his absence br br In the forest Brendan meets Ashley the protector of the forest She allows Brendan passage to the berries and along the way becomes akin to his company She warns him of the looming danger in the dark and not to foil with it There are things worse than Vikings out there From there Brendan is met with more challenges with the book and the looming certainty of invasion br br I like the story a lot more now that I know what it is about Knowing now what the Book of Kells is and what it contains the animation makes perfect sense I m sure you have seen pictures or copies of old texts from hundreds of years ago with frilly borders colorful pictures and extravagant patterns creatures and writings adorning the pages Much like the opening frames of Disney s The Sword in the Stone The animation here contains a lot of similar designs and patterns It creates a very unique viewing experience where the story and the animation almost try to outdo each other br br I couldn t take my eyes off of the incredible detail This is some of the finest 2D animation I have seen in years It s vibrant stimulating and full of life The characters are constantly surrounded by designs doodles and patterns in trees on the walls and in the air just floating around It enhances the film br br The story is satisfactory although I think the ending could have been strung out a little more With a runtime of only 75 minutes I think there could have been something special in the final act It doesn t give a lot of information nor does it allude to the significance of the book We are reminded of it s importance but never fully understand We are told that it gives hope but never why or how That was really the only lacking portion of the film Otherwise I thought the story was interesting though completely outdone by the animation br br I guess that s okay to a certain degree The animation can carry a film so far before it falls short The story lacks a few parts but it is an interesting take on a fascinating piece of history I would recommend looking up briefly the Book of Kells just to get an idea of what myself and this film are talking about I think it will help your viewing experience a lot more This a very impressive and beautifully illustrated film that should definitely not be missed
THE SECRET OF KELLS is an astonishing first animated feature which will dazzle your eye and move your heart The shortcomings of the film s limited budget and sometimes limited animation are more than compensated for by the visual poetry of the story of young Brendan s heroic quest to become a master illuminator during the dark ages Historically this was in the late 8th century when the centers of Irish learning were over run by the Vikings The Vikings appear here as brute antagonists the equivalent on the North Seas of the plundering Huns and Mongols further East The film s narrative which functions more as a parable centers around the conflict between Brendan who seeks to create beauty in his illuminations during a time of encroaching darkness and his stern Uncle the Abbot who seeks to protect the town of Kells and his nephew with a looming wall as barrier against the Norsemen The Abbot disregards the value of Brendan s art in his quest for security This is the movie s outer conflict Brendan s inner conflict is to find the hidden eye of creative illumination which will allow him to complete the most difficult painting in the Book of Kells This eye is guarded by a Dragon Ouroboros who destroys from within those not suited to this quest as surely as the Vikings will kill from without That s as much of the story as I ll divulge br br What I really like about this film is its creators imaginative understanding of some of the greatest art work to survive in the West from 1200 years ago The characters are stylized in flat abstract shapes defined by line just as in the original Book of Kells Particularly noteworthy is monk Aidan s pet cat defined in few lines yet purely and even magically metamorphically feline The range of emotion which Brendan and the other animated characters convey given their economy of abstract design is a tribute to the excellent artistry of the director and his animators The decorative borders on the edge of the picture change to complement the dramatic impact of a given scene and this characteristic of illuminations from the dark ages is brought to wondrous animated life in THE SECRET OF KELLS Of course historical dramas usually tell us more about our own times than the times which these dramas endeavor to depict However by introducing archetypal elements into this story the writers and director of THE SECRET OF KELLS convey a numinous sense of lived life from that far off time in Ireland which feels psychologically true however much the script might stray from pedantic historical fact The United Nations band of illuminators who appear as a rogues club of artists in The SECRET OF KELLS aren t historically probable but they re all well designed individuated characters who do much to convey the universal appeal of this quintessentially Irish story Animation has always seemed the best vehicle to me to better help us understand the visual art of different times and cultures The magnificent art direction of this movie clearly derives from its historical visual source but has also been cleverly adapted to the demands of animated storytelling if animation had existed in the Dark Ages the SECRET OF KELLS is what it would look like Finally Brendan s hero s quest in this film is the artist s perennial quest to convey the spirit of beauty life and inspiration Without being preachy or even particularly Christian this movie affirms Jesus dictum that Man does not live by bread alone In my estimation the most inspired movie about the creative process of visual artists is Andrei Tarkovsky s ANDREI RUBLEV a film about the great Russian icon painter of the 15th century The SECRET OF KELLS expresses much the same sense of mystery and exhilaration about the artist s visual quest and creative process It s certainly not as profound as ANDREI RUBLEV but heck its a cartoon And one which will appeal to young and old alike I think this movie will hold up well to repeated viewing in its own modest life affirming way this stylized SECRET OF KELLS is a classic
I would not have known about this film if not for its surprise Oscar nomination for Best Animated Feature film Thankfully it came to pass that I was able to watch this animated little treasure br br The story is about the child Brendan who was the nephew of the imposing and overprotective Abbot of the township of Kells The main pre occupation of the Abbot is to build a wall to protect Kells from the attacking Vikings One day Aiden the renowned illustrator from Iona sought refuge with them Aiden opens Brendan s eyes to the art of illustration and the lure of the outside world Along the way Brendan befriended the white forest sprite Aisling as he sought to recover an ancient crystal invaluable to the meticulous art of book illustration br br The Secret of Kells is unlike most of the animation released these days It is a throwback of sorts as the illustrations are done in stark geometric lines and design without much care for realism as much as symbolism The movements of these lines are reminiscent of the simplistic yet fluid animation style used at the beginning sequence of Kung Fu Panda However it is the magnificent use of color that is the main source of wonderment for the audience The reds used in the Viking invasion sequence is unforgettably haunting br br Try to catch this quiet gem of a film It is a welcome respite from all the senseless bombast of current animated fare such as Monsters vs Aliens and the like The sparse Celtic musical score is effective in evoking the sense of fantasy that imbues the film OK the story might be a little shallow and the ending a bit wanting I would have liked to know more about the Book that Brendan and Aiden was working on But the clear star of this film is clearly its amazing stylized artwork said to be based on the artwork in the real Book of Kells
THE SECRET OF KELLS may be the most exquisite film I have seen since THE TRIPLETS OF BELLEVILLE Although stylistically very different KELLS shares with TRIPLETS and the jaw dropping opening 2D sequence of KUNG FU PANDA incredible art direction production design background layout and a richness in color that is a feast for one s senses KELLS is so lavish almost Gothic in its layout somewhat reminiscent of Klimt wonderfully flat in general overall perspective ornate in its Celtic illuminated design yet the characters are so simplistic and appealing AND it all works together beautifully You fall in love with the characters from the moment you meet them You are so drawn to every detail of the story and to every stroke of the pencil brush What Tomm Nora Ross Paul and all at Cartoon Saloon their extended crews have achieved with this small budget VERY small crewed film is absolutely astounding The groundswell of support amongst our animation community is phenomenal This film is breathtaking and the buzz amongst our colleagues in recommending this film is spreading like wildfire Congratulations to KELLS on its many accolades its Annie nomination as well as its current Oscar qualifying run They are all very well deserved nods indeed
The Secret of Kells is a film I ve been waiting for for years after seeing some early footage at the Cartoon Saloon in Kilkenny I m here to tell you now it s been worth the wait The cartoons are heavily stylised but not annoyingly so as I d feared The whole film is a thing of beauty and great imagination I particularly love the animated illuminated book where the little figures come to life on the page The characterisation is superb I love Brendan Gleeson s voice as the stern Abbot and I especially liked the voice of the sprite Aisling The forest is a triumph such a beautiful place The story is well realised a mix of fact and fantasy and really draws the viewer in to cheer on Brendan in his quest for the perfect materials for the Book I m a lover of calligraphy and illumination anyway so the subject is close to my heart but all the people I know who ve seen this and are not fans of the craft agree that it s a lovely little film I will definitely buy the DVD when it s released and would like to say well done Cartoon Saloon and all the people involved in this mammoth project May there be many more Coming back in here to say that I bought several copies of the DVD as soon as I could and gave them out at Christmas everyone loves it And I wish them all the luck in the world at the Oscars such a joy to see this nominated
By 1945 and after a string of solid WWII propaganda pieces Errol Flynn s hold over U S box office had started to decline so in spite of the increased burden of waning looks he embarked on a series of films pertaining to that genre which had earlier made his name the swashbuckler The first of these was a good one actually ADVENTURES OF DON JUAN 1948 but it also proved to be his last big budget Hollywood starring vehicle The rest of his sword wielding days were spent wandering all over Europe in England for KIM 1950 THE MASTER OF BALLANTRAE 1953 and THE DARK AVENGER 1955 in France for ADVENTURES OF CAPTAIN FABIAN 1951 and Italy for the aborted THE STORY OF WILLIAM TELL 1953 and the little seen CROSSED SWORDS 1954 However Hollywood did beckon him one last time to his old seafaring ways albeit for a modestly budgeted Universal picture rather than a Warner Brothers A production to which he had been accustomed when at his peak br br Still the glorious Technicolor cinematography leaps off the screen here and while an older and flabbier Flynn may look like the pale shadow of his former self his red headed leading lady Maureen O Hara has a field day as a tomboyish buccaneer leader who deep down craves romance and wants to be treated like a lady Anthony Quinn was still a few years away from his larger than life starring vehicles so here he is typically seen as the baddie the pirate captain Roc Brasiliano a role he attacks with gusto Like THE BLACK SHIELD OF FALWORTH 1954 a viewing of which preceded this one AGAINST ALL FLAGS takes me back to my cherished childhood days of constant TV viewing when vintage Hollywood movies were the order of the day on both the local and neighboring Italian channels br br For all I know this might well have been the very first pirate movie I ve ever seen and I cringe at the thought of today s generation of youngsters supposedly believing that the grossly overblown PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN trilogy is what buccaneering is all about As I said earlier AGAINST ALL FLAGS might not be the finest pirate yarn ever brought to the screen but it s a solid example of this prolific genre all the same Nowadays the amorous persistence of the child like Indian princess Alice Kelley towards her pirate captor Flynn may strike one as being awfully silly but the rest of it despite clearly not scaling the heights of THE SEA HAWK 1940 and THE BLACK SWAN 1942 to mention the finest seafaring ventures of its respective stars is briskly paced and reasonably engaging Incidentally the film would later go on to be remade as THE KING S PIRATE 1967 with Doug McClure br br For what it s worth the unprecedented box office success of that unappetizing modern franchise is most probably what induced reluctant movie studios to dust off their catalogue swashbuckling titles and release them on DVD and as a matter of fact AGAINST ALL FLAGS itself was the one gem in a poorly thought out Pirates Of The Golden Age Movie Collection set from Universal which also consisted of obscure dross like BUCCANEER S GIRL 1950 with Yvonne De Carlo DOULE CROSSBONES 1951 with Donald O Connor and YANKEE BUCCANEER 1952 with Jeff Chandler Value for money perhaps but so far I have only acquired the Errol Flynn flick from other sources even so if the mood strikes me in future I might wish to lay my hands on similar marine adventures like Edward Dmytyk s MUTINY 1952 the afore mentioned YANKEE BUCCANEER and PIRATES OF TORTUGA 1961
Being the prototype of the classical Errol Flynn adventure movie and having a good story as well as two more brilliant co stars in Maureen O Hara what an exquisite beauty and Anthony Quinn I can only recommend this movie to all those having even the slightest liking for romance and adventure br br Hollywood at its best
A featherweight plot and dubious characterizations don t make any difference when a movie is as fun to watch as this one is Lively action and spectacular stunts for their day give this movie some real zip And there s some actual comedy from the ripping chemistry between the two leads Quinn makes a good villain also although his role is completely overshadowed br br But don t be fooled by Maureen O Hara s tough broad role this is as sexist as any Hollywood movie of this era You might be able to forgive that because of the time in which it was made but it s still hard to get past For all the heroism and gruesomely adult off screen situations this is still little more than an adolescent good time
Against All Flags is every bit the classic swashbuckler It has all the elements the adventure fan could hope for and more for in this one the damsel in distress is well not really in distress As Spitfire Stevens Maureen O Hara is at her athletic best running her foes through in defiance of the social norms of the period Anthony Quinn rounds out the top three billed actors as the ruthless Captain Roc Brasiliano and proves to be a wily and capable nemesis for Brian Hawke Flynn For the classic adventure fan Against All Flags is a must see While it may not be in quite the same league as some of Errol Flynn s earlier work Captain Blood and The Sea Hawk for instance it is still a greatly entertaining romp
Excellent pirate entertainment It has all the good ingredients to keep one s attention an absorbing tale of intrigue a fiery lady pirate named Spitfire Stevens Maureen O Hara who s attracted to the irresistible Mr Hawke Errol Flynn who is out on a secret mission of his own They make a fine romantic pair onscreen sigh br br Anthony Quinn is the mean bad pirate weaving his villainous web of divide and conquer I noticed the very familiar face of Mildred Natwick playing a supporting role as Mrs MacGregor the protector of young Princess Patma Alice Kelley br br There is beautifully filmed scenery of shorelines ships and the bay Lots of action too of sword fighting clashes ship battles daring leaps of Errol Flynn Robin Hood on board ship From the flaming redhead herself I once heard in an interview of Maureen O Hara that she boasted great command of the bullwhip and could also outdo Flynn in sword fighting in those days but there d be no need to put it to the test here br br Very enjoyable movie
Having seen Charley Boorman in Long Way Round with Ewan McGregor I was very interested to see how Charley would be in his own show I thought Charley came across as a lovely guy who is very grounded and down to earth Its nice to see that celebrities struggle with their weight and fitness it just show s their human too I don t know a lot about bikes but this show gripped me right from the start The preparation and organising for this event seems immense The event itself seems very dangerous and I m fascinated to see why Charley and everyone else is doing it and how far he gets I love the pace of the show and the fast upbeat music I can t believe he broke his collar bone I really hope its not the end I cant wait to see the next episode
The planning episodes were a bit dull but when they reached the desert it was quite fun to watch The reason why I call it the most realistic reality show is because much to my surprise Charley fell out of the race relatively early When his hands were sore I expected the usual stress and then a miracle fix but instead he actually quit the race The most anxious moment of the show must ve been when Max was stuck out in the desert with almost no water or food The ending was great and I was very happy to see at least one of the team make it Overall not as great as the Long Way Round but definitely an interesting watch as one gets a peek into the most challenging race in the world
I always follow the Dakar so when my husband bought Charlie s Race to Dakar DVD home I couldn t wait to watch it Of course we d seen the broadcast of the race when the actual race was on but that never gives the background and specific teams br br If you watched Long Way Round then you won t be surprised by the language which frankly I find more amusing than offensive br br I think the only thing that annoyed me about the DVD was Charlie s hair but he had it styled before Dakar so my feminine need for neatness was assuaged tho I could have lived without the flame undies lol As with LWR the preparation was every bit as interesting as the race itself I nearly cried when Charlie broke his hand and winced at every bruise he sustained while training and of course the death of Andy Caldicott that was an appalling tragedy but then every year there s something br br Russ drives me nuts although his attitude has improved a thousand times from the argumentative cynic he was in LWR It s great to see him get along so well now with Charlie br br What I learned from this odyssey was 1 never let Scorpion prepare your vehicle for ANYTHING they had months to prepare the X5 and still the day before the team left for Lisbon Scorpion had only done half of things that needed to be done and the vehicle was a pain throughout the whole race 2 the Dakar organizers need to put a lot more work into their rider driver retrieval plan leaving Matt and presumably a large number of other riders drivers out to dry the way they did was nothing short of culpable negligence 3 Charlie has an endearing enthusiasm for rough and tough adventure but needs to toughen up a lot to really perform as he d like and finally 4 Charlie and Ewan are planning another of these epos called the Long Way Down in 2007 and I can t wait to get my hands on it D If you love bikes and or genuinely nice blokes having a go you have to watch this I guarantee you love it It s very entertaining br br In conclusion to Simon Pavey you sir are a hero I was so impressed by the your quiet achiever manner and the fact that you actually finished just incredible considering what an monumentally difficult race it is And to Charlie Matt and the rest of the team full marks for pulling it off To think that a relatively green team could have achieved so much is truly admirable You re all wonderful
If you loved Long Way Round you will enjoy this nearly as much It is educational funny interesting and tense Charley shares the screen with two interesting teammates two tired mechanics two excellent cameramen and too much Russ Ewan makes a few appearances but Charley really pulls it off alone He is funny engaging and still a puddle of stress and doubt Great stuff br br The series wraps up in 7 episodes Like LWR the preparation is nearly as interesting as the race Though they cover the ins and outs of the race well there could be a bit more explanation of the trucks and cars which are merely mentioned and rarely even seen racing It is a motorcycle movie though and anyone on two wheels will love this br br The series features stunning photography as well as a few interviews of peoples mouths Yikes There is another extremely catchy theme song like LWR but this one is not nearly as good as the Stereophonics br br If you live in the US god knows when it will be released so buy it on Amazon uk and watch it on your computer as I did Oh and be prepared to buy another motorbike
I loved Long Way Round and wasn t even aware of Race to Dakar until i saw it on the shelves of my local supermarket I bought it and after a slightly hmm will this be as good first episode i decided that it was Charlie Boorman was great as were the other members of the crew Great to see him with Ewan again There was a fair bit of swearing in it but that didn t bother me As for their being no mention of it on the package Thats more to do with the silly Excempt from Classification certificate that the BBFC have They should have given it a 15 just for the language alone br br Highly recommended series i want more
Clara Bow Hula Calhoun is daughter of plantation owner Albert Gran Bill Calhoun who is mainly interested in playing cards and boozing with friends She s interested in riding in the countryside until engineer Clive Brook Anthony Haldane shows up to build a dam One of her father s friends Arlette Marchal Mrs Bane then competes for his attentions His wife Maude Truax Margaret Haldane shows up for the contrived finale br br Lots of pre code elements like nude bathing br br Wonderful location shooting in Hawaii
clara bow s beauty and wonderful appeal are the chief reason to watch this film hula is not quite up to par with clara s best films but it is still enjoyable she dances she rides her horse and pursues the man that she loves this film is just over an hour in length and was directed by future oscar winner victor fleming gone with the wind the film moves quickly and clara bow has lots of screen time if you like clara i would reccomend hula
OK Clara Bow silent film from 1927 it s a spin off of Rain with Bow playing the half Hawaiian wild daughter of the local pineapple king who falls in love with the staid English engineer Clive Brook Bow competes with the local widow Arlette Marchal for his attentions but both women get a big surprise when his wife shows up Patricia Dupont The predatory wife is ready for a divorce until she discovers he might be on the verge of a fortune Bow settles her hash fast br br Bow has personality to spare and has a few great scenes her opening nude bath her hula in a grass skirt and the dog rescue scene with Bow and Brook doing their own stunts br br Note the IMDb credit list is wrong The film credits from the DVD I have list Patricia Dupont as playing Mrs Haldane not Margaret Truax as listed on IMDb
Many of the reviews and comments I have read about this movie say that this is a rather stale film and performance by Clara Bow Although the story line was rather typical of Clara s later silents I still find it somewhat heart stirring and incredibly fun Clara plays a happy go lucky Hawaiian girl who will stop at nothing to win the man she loves never mind that this man is married Clara s lack of modesty was shocking in the day but I believe it lends to the sweetness and general fun of the movie Though definitely not a brilliant story line quite typical actually this movie is a nice showcase of Clara s ability to make the audience laugh
There s a theory of time that posits that all the moments that ever existed and will exist actually exist right now It s a bit too much to wrap your head around but perhaps a bit of a comfort to those who wish they could go back to a simpler time and place For Barbara Jean Trenton Ida Lupino that time was twenty five years earlier the mid 1930 s when her youth and glamor held the greatest promise For my part if I could travel through time it would be back to the 1950 s when I grew up Maybe to a place like Willoughby but that s another episode br br One thing that wouldn t be so special about 1959 would involve dealing with all that clunky machinery just to watch an episode of The Twilight Zone How many reels do you think it would take to catalog the entire series and then find a particular story you wanted to watch I guess you have to consider the trade offs convenience versus simplicity having it right now or taking the time to spool it up to the exact spot where the story begins Popping in a CD has it s advantages br br I m a little surprised that Rod Serling would pen a story that so closely resembled Sunset Boulevard Ida Lupino s character mirror imaged Norma Desmond just a bit too closely to be considered an original concept Martin Balsam portrays very much a similar character to Erich von Stroheim the husband turned butler who s loyalty is unquestioned Where the story diverges has to do with the way Danny Balsam and Sall Ted de Corsia challenge Barbara Jean to get with reality and clear the cobwebs that paralyze her existence br br Fortunately for us viewers Ida Lupino had no such reservations about taking parts that were not big but a nice showcase It s a real treat to watch any episode of The Twilight Zone and get to see who pops up from days gone by Sometimes you get a two fer like you have here with Lupino and Balsam celebrities who sometimes made their mark before the series began and sometimes after Combined with the stories that the program produced it s not surprising that they still manage to entertain so well today
I really enjoyed this episode which was a great surprise given the bad reputation it seems to have acquired From a pure writing perspective The 16mm shrine is an absolute treat with fantastic dialogue and character analysis typical of Sterling In particular I really enjoyed the philosophical indulgences of the episode tackling themes of existence and reality whilst balancing it with more psychological topics such as denial pride and desire The sixteen millimeter shrine is an episode about how these ideas based around an unwillingness to accept change can seemingly alienate a person from the rest of the ever changing world It is also a fantastic example of cerebral Twilight Zone one that explores the mind rather than the world outside it These elements all come together very nicely to create a thought provoking and incredibly interesting 25 minutes br br The episode is not without its faults however which mainly lay in Lupino and Leisen shoes Ironically I felt Lupino was unconvincing throughout with only a few scenes that could count as memorable This of course being an absolute shame considering how well Sterling had written her character Furthermore Leisen didn t seem to know what to do with most of his characters sometimes having them stand around on set doing next to nothing which probably explains why accepted the poor performances from Lupino half the time Thankfully Balsam does a good job of covering up a lot of weak spots helping redeem the show from an acting perspective at least br br As I said previously however if you re a fan of classic film and cerebral science fiction this shouldn t be as bad as it s sometimes made out to be In addition to the writing that I mentioned above the episode also features some fantastic photography it still amazes me that the show looks this good nearly fifty years later and decent enough set design Overall The sixteen millimeter shrine is a great episode and above all is certainly one to make you think
After hitting the viewers with three very different episodes right off the bat Serling continued to go about introducing viewers to The Twilight Zone in a very strange way by scheduling one the series biggest growers as the fourth episode The Sixteen Millimeter Shrine is one of the more understated episodes focusing on an aging movie star s inability to cope with the changing times and only introducing a supernatural element in the closing minutes Because of this approach the episode is under whelming at first but subsequent viewings reveal it to be a thoroughly classy and beautifully written short story br br Both the leads Ida Lupino as Barbara Jean Trent and Martin Balsam as her frustrated but caring agent shine in their performances The main problem with the episode is that the supposedly 25 year old footage of the actress is unconvincing Lupino looks identical when playing the young Trent as she does when playing the middle aged Trent and this diminishes the tragedy of the situation significantly Fortunately Lupino acts her socks off in convincing us of her desperation to return to the past It s a situation most can sympathise with and yet Trent is far from a sympathetic character She is a prima donna who gives little thought to the feelings of those around her such as the disastrously withered co star who she tactlessly belittles because he reminds her of just how long ago her glory days were It is somewhat surprising then that she is rewarded with a happy ending It is clear what is going to happen from the moment we see the huge projection screen and it is cleverly pre empted in the opening moments when Trent scares her maid by stepping out from behind the screen What is not clear at the beginning however is whether being sucked into the projector will prove a reward or a harsh lesson in appreciating what we have and living in the moment As it turns out Trent is allowed to return to the past she longed for a testament to how strong the wishful thinking of humans can be br br The Sixteen Millimeter Shrine gets better with each viewing The top notch writing and acting combine to create a short play of enormous power which reflects the nature of humans to long for the past even though we can never return Except in the Twilight Zone
I found this movie really funny because you have a youthful black comedian Chris Rock who dies and is sent back to earth in a mid 50 s white mans body He doesn t realize that his behavior should change and continues to act as he had before He listens to rap music sings along and plays the stereotypical part of an urban black man The real humor in this movie was watching the trouble that this behavior gets him into with the black community
THis was a hilarious movie and I would see it again and again It isn t a movie for someone who doesn t have a fun sense of a humor but for people who enoy comedy like Chris Rock its a perfect movie in my opinion It is really funnny
My fondness for Chris Rock varies with his movies I hated him after Lethal Weapon 4 but I hated everyone in that movie after it I like him when he is himself and not holding back like in Dogma Well this is his best yet wasn t expecting this to be that good Laughed my arse off the whole time Chris Rock delivers a sweet wonderful story backed by some of the funniest comedy I ve seen in quite some time Loved it
Down To Earth is the best movie It is SO funny and it s really sweet too It has a good plot and it s unique It isn t like those movies that are all the same with the similar story lines and it s not all comedy and no story This movie also has a very good ending
Hopefully the score has changed by now due to my brilliant and stunning review which persuades all of you to go and watch the film thereby creating an instant chorus of 8 s this movie s true score br br As mentioned before Chris Rock is The King Previous to going to see this movie I wasn t that over the top about him but now I m banging on the doors of Chris Rock s website begging him to take me on as his protege This film is truly funny if you don t find this movie funny you REALLY need therapy and it s humour which targets all areas of society including race predictably class division love wealth employment dreams stand up comedy the list goes on br br There was one slight disappointment for me however This was that in going into this film I didn t realise that it was actually a remake of Heaven Can Wait another quite good movie made in 1971 with Warren Beatty As such I was quite surprised when I watched this movie and suddenly the plot began to unravel to be distinctly similar to an older movie I had watched on TV a few weeks ago Regardless this movie is in my opinion the better version out of the two of them simply because of the different areas it covers and the fact that Chris Rock is funnier than Warren Beatty any second of any day of any week of any year of any you get the picture br br Well to the actual plot of the film br br Don t spoil the experience for yourself Don t read the plot Just go and watch a movie because there have been two reviews on IMDb so far that have raved mad about it go see it because it is the funniest thing you would have seen in a long time go and see it because it s a cinema experience that doesn t leave you grumbling ad nauseum at the cost of cinema tickets Go see it because it is a good movie
This movie i have been dying to see Well it took till now to decide to actually rent it It was completely worth it This movie made me laugh from the beginning to the end Chris Rock is funny no matter which movie he is in However this should come real close to being his greatest If ur lookin for a family movie ie pre teens and up then this is one u can t pass over
Great movie when I saw it Have to say one of my favorite movies of all time I saw it like 8 times in the theater and got the DVD As I got older and saw it again I realized that the movie is average Compared to movies that are known ad good comedys this is nothing I mean Rock was hilarious in the movie and the whole switching with the racial stuff breaks a little barriers which is great Also the thought of how the movie goes is a nice way of thinking It s like most thought of a movie but also a little twist which is a very nice touch I like the movie overall so i give it a br br Still a good 7 10 for me
I m not saying that just as a Chris Rock fan I m saying this as a person who had low expectations going in to this movie and was proved wrong The first flaw was it s everything works out ending that everybody saw coming Flaw number two was I found that the chemistry between Regina King and Chris Rock seemed fake Finally the acting in this movie was sub par with the best actor being Regina King and the worst being Mark Addy but I saw past that flaw and saw a solid comedy In a heads up scenario watch heaven can wait instead it s better So for all you Chris Rock fans out there WATCH THIS MOVIE you ll enjoy out He has some good stand up in this movie br br Overall 7 out of 10
This movie is a remake of two movies that were a lot better The last one Heaven Can Wait was great I suggest you see that one This one is not so great The last third of the movie is not so bad and Chris Rock starts to show some of the comic fun that got him to where he is today However I don t know what happened to the first two parts of this movie It plays like some really bad B movie where people sound like they are in some bad TV sit com The situations are forced and it is like they are just trying to get the story over so they can start the real movie It all seems real fake and the editing is just bad I don t know how they could release this movie like that Anyway the last part isn t to bad so wait for the video and see it then
Chris Rock stars in this remake of Warren Beatty s Heaven Can Wait itself a remake of the 1941 film Here Comes Mr Jordan a comedy about a man who dies before his time before he can realize his dreams and his adventures in his new albeit temporary body In the Beatty version the protagonist was a backup quarterback for the then Los Angeles Rams In Rock s hipper version our lead character is a struggling young and decidedly low talent standup comedian br br It s very funny to see the razor sharp Rock playing a bad comedian It s kind of like seeing Tom Hanks play a bad actor Lance Barton s dream is to play the legendary Apollo Theater on a non amateur night But every time he tries out his material he s booed off the stage lustily so much so that his nickname becomes Booie His jokes are lame his delivery painful In short Lance is everything that the real Chris Rock isn t br br Lance is also a bike messenger and he s riding the streets on his way to try out even more material when BAM He s hit by a truck Ok so maybe he was taken from his body a tenth of a second early by a slightly incompetent angel Eugene Levy but hey he was going to get hit anyway No dice it appears Lance isn t due in Heaven until 2044 So what to do Mr King Chazz Palminteri the manager of Heaven reluctantly agrees to find a new body for the not quite dead Mr Barton Trouble is the body they find is of a greedy old white man Turns out this fella a Mr Wellington owns all kinds of things he s the 15th richest man in the country What luck You can imagine how Lance will turn things around br br But of course while in the body of the affluent Mr Wellington Lance falls for a gorgeous hospital worker Regina King We males know how tough it is to find a female given our own body but try winning one over while you re an dumpy old white guy And it s even worse when she s not impressed by your money br br This is Rock s first shot at a lead role and in my opinion he performs admirably There s still a lot of the standup comedian in him and of course if he ever wants to get diverse roles he might have to stop incorporating standup routines into the script but this isn t really a bad thing Rock s personality his drive his delivery his demeanor and his passion are what fuel this film He s clearly having a lot of fun in the role and he seems bent on making sure you have fun watching him
This is such a great film Never mind the low rating here I really have no idea where that came from they must be discussing a different film then Because I absolutely loved it and found it to be a little hidden treasure br br It s story was so original and charming I really can t think of anything bad to say about it Maybe it has to be your type of thing but I saw this with my sister and my mother and we all were taken by it br br The acting was also very good and that is hard to do in a film like this But I found all the characters very intriguing and sympathetic br br I ve always been very fond of Dougray Scott and found his new dark role very interesting It is really awful hard to get me to like a bad guy but I absolutely had no problem with that this time Even more so I adored him br br Everyone who loves a good thriller drama that also has a good dose of love and tragedy should definitely go see this film no question about that Anyone wanting to see a film with 80 bloodshed should go rent something else though But I guess the title already kind of gives that away This is a love story not Saw 3 br br I give this film 4 out of five stars Good job br br xxx Enjoy
A Thief in the Night is a film that was generally ignored by movie fans at large due to its low budget which was obvious and its subject matter the Rapture of true Christian church and the fate of those left behind Nevertheless it was a gripping story that held the viewer and definitely made him or her review their relationship with Jesus Christ It touched everyone showing even a pastor who preached the Word but did not believe it knowing exactly why he was left behind This movie and its sequel Distant Thunder are must see movies Even with the new Left Behind series coming out telling the same story with a much higher budget the impact is still the same A Thief in the Night broke the ground of this genre and will always be remembered
This Film was really eye opening I have seen this film several times First when I was four and I actually remembered it and then when I was 12 The whole message that the director is conveying is for everyone to wake up and not make the mistake of leaving God out of our everyday lives or just Plain going the extra mile to insult him br br A great Movie for Non believers and Believers alike
I would say for it s time this movie was awesome and yes if you have no desire to become a Christian then why bother watching it I saw this movie after I had already been saved and found it to be very moving I see now they have taken these movies to another level and have created the Left Behind series they run a close comparison and definitely are more modern to reach people I think in order to actually judge this movie you should see it there are 3 or 4 of them in the series if I am not mistaken don t use our comments to judge see the movie for yourself God will bless you if that is why you are watching them
I have seen this movie a whole dozen times and it s awesome But the only thing with it was that in the beginning there was too much talk of who s going out with who I think that it would be interesting to do a remake of it But on the official site they said that they will not be making a remake of it because so many people have gotten saved when viewing it What s even happened to Patty Dunning now She is a pretty good actress She has done several other movies in the 70s and 80s but we haven t heard from her since I know for sure about Thom Rachford who plays Jerry works for Accounting at RD Films But overall I have to say that the series itself is like Left Behind gone old school
I ve read most of the comments on this movie I have seen this movie and the whole prophecy series many times with family members of all ages we all enjoyed and it just made us meditate on what we already knew from reading and studying the bible about the rapture and end times No one got scared or traumatized like I have read on some posts The movie is just based on biblical facts I have seen a lot of end time movies Tribulation Armagedon and so on and by far this one is one of the best in presenting bible truths It may not have a lot of great special effects like todays movies but I believe it is a good witnessing tool This movie and its prophecy series can be seen free at this website higherpraise com and judge for yourself Blessings to all
This is a great movie for all Generation X ers What a different world the America of 1972 was compared to our psychotic 21st Century You can get a sense of what an 1972 America gone by was like by watching this movie I found that the clothing and the car styles brought back to me fond memories of a much better country than we have now Just think back then there were only 4 or 5 TV stations to choose from There was no AIDS Muslim terrorists Road Rage 911 Bird Flu Freeway Snipers etc etc The Vietnam war was just over There will still be 7 years before Star Wars comes out The personal computer and internet would still be 29 years away br br When this movie first came out the producers had to market the film themselves as no other film company wanted it So it began touring small Protestant churches around the country being shown on movie projectors This was the days before VCRS of course The pastor of a church who would would be interested in showing A Thief in the NIght to his congregation would obtain a copy of the film Then he would set up a evening to show it in the church meeting area or lunch room Members of the congregation would invite unsaved friends and family members and it would be a social event of the week br br If you can get past the limited production values of the film and just watch it for its nostalgic value then I think you will enjoy the film more Of course I am speaking as a gen xer br br If I had a time machine I would go back to 1972 and say goodbye to the 21st century cesspool we have now
A Thief in the Night has got to be the best out of all the end times thrillers I have no clue what people are complaining about what people are whining about when they say that these movies scared them into accepting God They just needed to find an excuse and blamed A Thief In The Night Do not listen These movies do not only tell of one of the many possibilities of the tribulation but they re also fun to watch in their simplicity They are in fact low budget and that is a little obvious but not all too obvious upon first viewing I had no clue because I really assumed that a lot of movies like these made in the 70 s included low budgets all the time br br A Thief in the night tells the story of young and cynical Patty Myers who lives for what comes her way until her husband and nearly all her friends disappear in the prophetic rapture everyone warned her about At first the movie isn t all based around her until the rapture happens What it leads up to are showing that everyone else around her are becoming christians and believing in Christ which is usually what happens to a lot of people Everyone around them they once knew and loved will be gone forever and the one who is left behind is the one who blames everyone but themselves No one can ever blame themselves because they re always right br br Just like these whiners who complain about the movie These people must be full grown adults I m thirteen and you don t see me whining especially since I was exactly like Patty before I re accepted Christ into my heart For those who haven t seen it if you want a little bit of everything tossed into a Christian movie instead of stereo typical everyone else is wrong movies than you ll enjoy A Thief In The Night Don t knock it before you try it Something new is always good Trust your own instincts
This is a great movie Some will disagree with me but if you know anything about the bible you know it is I think everyone should see it I agree a new updated version like be nice but the message is still right on If you can see this movie Is not a scare the hell of you movie it is truthful with the Bible I think the U N will play a major role in the world government to come The last days are lining up with the Bible Look at what has happened with the chip for dogs and cats that now has come to light to protect on children from being kidnapped It s the size of a grain of rice This I feel is the fore runner of the mark of the beast spoken of in the Bible Without the mark you can t sell or buy with this chip that small in the future there is no telling how much info can be put on it
A THIEF IN THE NIGHT is an excellent fictional account of the weeks leading up to the RAPTURE and the weeks following that pivotal event br br I thoroughly enjoyed both the production values and the content values of this independent Christian movie br br THE PRODUCTION VALUES Hey it s an independent movie with a shoe string budget so ya it s going to look a bit cheesy if your standard is A list Hollywood fare But properly compared with other independent movies this film is perfectly acceptable More important than acting style costumes and music is the narrative itself Is the story compelling Do the dramatic moments work Does the story trajectory build to a satisfying climax The answer to all these questions is an unqualified yes As a side note the truly important technical stuff continuity sound lighting are fine The viewer is able to watch the show without being distracted by sloppy craftsmanship br br CONTENT VALUE The message of the movie is superb When you consider how many ideas the movie maker developed within the brief span of 69 minutes you begin to appreciate his artistry He presents the message of salvation the consequence of unbelief the danger of backsliding the truth of the rapture and the threat of a world dominating satanic government with flare imagination and most importantly for an evangelical movie with biblical accuracy br br The movie maker is a good storyteller For example he develops the message of salvation in two important ways 1 he shows us through action the reality of Jesus Christ s sacrifice for our sake This is achieved in a subplot where the zoo keeper is bit by a poisonous snake and nearly dies The only cure is blood from someone who is immune to the snake poison The poison is like sin the cure is like Christ s blood shed on the cross 2 The filmmaker also develops the message of salvation through dialog He has various characters explain the truth about human sin and the need for salvation through faith in Christ So the movie maker uses both action and dialog to tell his story br br As a side note the fact that a movie produced by evangelical Christians actually contains dialog and scenes that convey a clearly delineated message of salvation couched in explicitly evangelical Christian language imagery and theology is also perfectly acceptable To criticize this film for being explicitly Christian is absurd it s akin to criticizing a Nike commercial for promoting sport wear What else would evangelical Christian movie makers make if not a film that states their case Also the fact that the movie maker employs the idea that the unbelieving will be left behind in a godless world is again perfectly acceptable The movie maker uses the dramatic potential of that idea admirably How do I know I heard about A THIEF IN THE NIGHT from a woman who saw the show way back in 1974 it still lived in her memory thirty years later How many movies can you say that about All around a very enjoyable thought provoking show I plan on showing it to my teen group at church
Obviously there wasn t a huge budget for this film which definitely hindered the production But the story and ending were so brutal that they made up for a lot I mean brutal on the level of Ju Dou and other great Chinese films I first saw this when I was 14 years old I ran home and begged God to forgive me for everything
To all the reviewers on this page I would have to say this movie is worth seeing So It was made in 1972 so what The fashion in the movie was exactly the same fashion of its time People who didn t study culture of the decades would think that this movie is a cheese ball Compared to the modern series Left Behind Which is made for our time right now it does look cheezy However the only cheezy part of the movie is the fashion which again was over 30 years in the past BUT The message that is sent in this film is very powerful and carefully preserved There is just so much to say but I refuse to say it for fear of spoiling it So go out and see this film If you don t like the message that it sends then you have issues that need some attention
I remember seeing this movie a long time ago back then even though it didn t have any special effects the acting was really good And it still has the same message for today even though the technology has changed maybe they should make a remake of this movie it would be interesting to see a remake I also enjoyed the music from the movie as well Larry Norman was a really good songwriter during that time period although now most Christian music is now worship and praise music I was always curious to know what ever happened to Patty after the series ended Did she go on to make more movies did she get eventually get married and raise a family I would like to have an update
The reason why people say that this movie scared them is because it did That means the movie purpose was felt by a few who did see it When I first saw this Movie it scared me and made me think about life and religion This is not a blood and gore scary type movie but the kind that you would think that it may be possible for things to happen the way the movie was written Of course non believers will say its only a sci fi movie Truth is this movie is a must have for your thriller collection even if it does have a religious view If you are a fan of classic thrillers Omen etc this is one of them and its a must have I never saw the sequel Distant Thunder but I believe it picks up where this movie ends
Now for all of the cinematographical buffs out there this film may not rank high on your list of things to see But if you know anything about plot development profound truth and the intentions that this film the series had you d understand my p o v br br Granted the specifics of the film are renderings of the writer who cannot be expected to know what will happen in the end But the film is biblically accurate and justifiably scares viewers into thinking about what may be I m a Christian not due to this movie but due to my personal decision to accept Jesus as my Savior The film and potential that something similar to the circumstances portrayed therein can remarkably scare someone into thinking about their actions and decisions It s not some cheap attempt to scare people into believing in God but rather a means to get your attention br br As a Christian I know I ll not be left behind and thanks to movies like this I can look beyond the superficialities of entertainment acting and film budgeting to appreciate the depth that the film has to offer This is a movie you shouldn t not only see but feel with your heart and soul
Long before Tim LaHaye and Jerry B Jenkins would shake the world of the Christian subculture and make millions in the process with the LEFT BEHIND books MARK IV Pictures the Christian film distribution company of the Billy Graham evangelistic association gave us this masterwork What I love most about this genre is its incredible attention to detail sitting in a living room Instead of taking us to the dramatic scenes of this post rapture tribulation we sit in the living room hearing about it on the news because the filmmakers can t afford to show it The film s premise is grounded in Pre Millenial pre Tribulation eschatalogy believing that Christ comes once for the secret taking of the true church and then comes again at the end of the seven years of hell on earth What used to terrify me in junior high now makes me laugh The intriguing adventures of Patty and her journey throughout the tribulation and two of the film s three sequels tells her remarkable story of unbelief and ultimately damnation I hate to admit it but I still thoroughly enjoy watching this It even has the SAME EXACT score of Monty Python and the Holy Grail I think I m the only person in history to make that observation
Ms Patty Duke s story about her life and struggles with manic depression were just like my life struggles I saw myself acting out just like her I was so amazed at the similarities of our lives to include the sexual abuse that we both endured as children br br I saw the movie when it first premiered in 1990 and I have loved this movie so much Anyone who has struggled with manic depression could get so much from this movie Never mind about if it showed her awards or what they were for That is not the issue here The issue is how Ms Duke had an illness and fought to survive it and overcame Ms Duke has much to be proud of in her accomplishments with her struggles for survival of a disease that often leaves many victims without hope br br Unless a person has struggled with this illness personally they don t know the hell they have to live with The movie to me was a success because it showed the real issues and how a person who is depressed and manic acts It was so real so so real It was like watching myself up there on screen br br I wish I could thank Ms Patty Duke in person for having the courage to let the public know about her illness Bocka
This is such a great movie Call Me Anna because it shows how a person has suffered for so long without knowing what was wrong with her For Patty Duke to come out in the publics eye and tell her story is an inspiration to those who suffer from this disease I have a lot of respect for her as a person The only thing I don t like is I can t get it on tape I ve tried looking for it but with no success Any one know how to get it
I think it took a lot of guts for her to come forward like that It is unfortunate that when a celebrity suffers that is what helps people most But in her case what she did was remarkable I have been in the mental health field for five years and I think it is great that mental illness is not a terrible word anymore and I believe she helped I always thought she was great and always will I am glad that she wrote this book and that the movie was made She is a remarkable lady and I hope she continues to act She has been through a lot and has faced it I would really love to see her work more with children especially child actors Her ordeal should not have happened and I think she would be wonderful as a mentor to young people The movie was so moving to me that I was very touched Suffering a TBI which brought the onset of my disorder and having PTSD it is good to know that someone has the courage enough to display her life as she did I believe it helped this nation and people in general realize that there are others like them and that there is help Thank you Ms Duke or Anna which ever you prefer
Then you must see this film to understand the reality Having read the book Ms Duke is now an advocate for those afflicted with bipolar disorder formerly labeled manic depression br br It is hard to believe that in this day and age people still critique others with emotional problems or those who seek psychiatric help Regressive and discriminatory thinking still exists and this is unfortunate br br In this film the audience sees the pain and suffering Ms Duke had been through especially as a child Many of us may remember her from the teenage Patty Duke Show She was a household name in America by age 15 br br You learn of her exploitation by the Ross well played by Howard Hesseman As she was growing up in the 1950 s the stigma was in full force However we see as she advances in her career yet the illness becomes worse She goes through bouts of substance abuse and promiscuity even marries someone whom she divorces the next week and she has several conflicts and tantrums with her children and elderly mother All these problem occurred before she received adequate therapy and medication br br A recent survey released by NAMI National Alliance on Mental Illness recorded that a majority of US adults fail to recognize most of the classic symptoms of bipolar disorder It also was released that one in five respondents to the poll believed that people could CONTROL their illness without medication if they wanted to bp Magazine Winter 2006 If you watch this film you will learn the true story of a talented woman who could not pull herself up by her bootstraps and get well until she was educated about her disorder and received proper treatment Thank you Ms Duke for being an advocate against ignorance and prejudice
This is a cute little horror spoof comedy featuring Cassandra Peterson aka Elvira Mistress of the Dark the most infamous horror hostess of all time This was meant to be the pilot vehicle for Elvira and was so successful that it was picked up by the NBC Network They filmed a pilot for a television series to feature the busty babe in black but unfortunately the sit com never made it past the pilot stage due to it s sexual references This film however is very amusing Elvira is the modern day Chesty Morgan and the queen of the one liners This film was followed up a few years later by the abysmal Elvira s Haunted Hills which was meant to be a take off of the old Roger Corman movies but falls flat on it s face Watch this movie instead for a much more entertaining experience
Cassandra Peterson originally created Elvira as the television hostess of late night horror films and when the character proved unexpectedly popular she suddenly found herself doing everything from beer commercials to spots on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson She reached the peak of her popularity in the late 1980s and the film ELVIRA MISTRESS OF THE DARK was the result br br The plot is flyweight Television horror film hostess Elvira dreams of success in Las Vegas When her great aunt dies she travels to New England in hopes that the estate will provide enough money to back a stage show she is disappointed to find she has inherited a rundown house a poodle and an old book It happens that the town is puritanical beyond all description and she provokes righteous indignation everywhere she goes It also happens that her great uncle is secretly an evil warlock and very intent on laying hands on the old book Throw in a few teenagers a stud muffin and a hateful woman with falsies and there you go br br No one would accuse it of being a cinematic masterpiece and it does drag now and then But Cassandra Peterson demonstrates tremendous flair from start to finish squirmy sexy and mixing lowbrow humor with flashes of sharp comedy she dances through the film like a ringmaster in a circus of corny and often self mocking jokes From a FLASHDANCE disaster to witchcraft craziness she is never less than wildly entertaining It s a tremendous amount of fun and the film s conclusion even manages to generate considerable suspense Will Elvira best her evil uncle and save the day Well I don t want to give anything away so let s just say you ll have a lot of fun finding out br br DVD quality is okay and there s little in the way of bonus material but if you re in the mood for something silly this one is sure to answer the urge And if you ve never seen tassle twirling you re in for a treat Recommended br br GFT Amazon Reviewer

Those who love Elivra as I did in her late night movie hostess duties will love this movie she is just plain cool her car is great and she is a bit of a Transylvanian Dolly Parton she is so innocent and naive at times and sexy all of the time plus more than a touch of Mae West br br The sets are well done as well and the comic cast is great with Edie McClurg at her usual best plus Sally Kellerman as Patty is hilarious Any time I have to crunch something for a topping I will think of how Elvira crunches the potato chips br br This movie is one to be watched again and again just for the fun of it Now I have to get the sequel to it Elvira s Haunted Hills and see if it lives up to this one
Elvira Mistress of The Dark is a fun camp horror comedy in which the fourth wall is broken a couple of times and the jokes often stay below the navel And the breasts of Cassandra Peterson become a character of their own br br Elvira Cassandra Peterson is stacked horror show hostess who learns that she has inherited her aunt Morgana So she goes to a little town of Fallwell which is ruled by the most horrendous monster ever to embrace the earth Morality comity Elviras boobacious appearance is of course too much for the prunes but the kids of the town get a kick out of her different kind of approach on life And of course there is even more sinister evil her uncle Vincent William Morgan Sheppard who is after Elvira s mothers book of spells See Elvira actually is a real witch she just doesn t know it Yet br br For what it is Elvira is quite funny film even though the script does leave a lot of room for improvement Most laughs come from the difference between Elvira and the people of good morals but there are a couple of good visual gags as well Over all direction is okay but it never rises to be anything more than that In all a good intentionally campy comedy If you like this kind of thing that is
I wasn t expecting much and to be honest I didn t like this film the first time around but watching it again and I realised that it s kinda cool Sure it s a one joke film but it s a funny gag br br Someone posted that it could be better written and it could be I think this film had the potential to be a over the top My Cousin Vinny But with a horror host instead of a lawyer Sadly it s a wasted opportunity With just a bit more writing it could be a classic The kids are underused there s no reason why they should latch on to Elvira Apart from the obvious reasons It would have been great to see their relationship flourish I know it s a comedy but it s little differences that separate the good films from the brilliant br br Elvira herself is always fun and engaging Not to mention flirty Every time she smiles you will too It s hard to knock a film when the main character is so charming And it really is her charm don t let her looks fool you into thinking that she s some sort of tart Well she is But she s a nice one The sort of person you d let look after your kids Wouldn t let her cook for them though br br I d recommend giving it a go br br Just don t expect too much br br She s more than just a great set of boobs She s also an incredible pair of legs
The magnetism radiated from Elvira drawing her legions of devoted admirers has a primordial quality With her lengthy well toned figure large bust innocuously mischievous attitude and grab bag lexicon of me generation valley slang the character of Elvira has a universal and timeless appeal As an aspiring folklorist and an individual deeply interested in the structure of storytelling it is evident that the Elvira persona has certain archetypal elements that help to make the character more than the sum of her corny one liners and large chest As initiated from the manner in which the children of the town react to her she represents the deep adolescent fantasy for an experienced woman whom can connect to them of their level a strange mixture of one dimensional romantic yearning boyish sexual craving and the desire for non threateningly lighthearted fun She symbolizes an undeveloped ideal of womanhood perfected for the boys and a source of strength for the girls of the town The other adults have trouble with her for the same reasons In the end however her film cannot move pass its more campy ingredients The end result is that while Elvira is infinitely interesting her film is limited by how weak a showcase it is for her talents Nearly everything is tailored to an adolescent mindset and although it is a straightforward comedy only those who can still process information with the mind of a young person will be able to enjoy the nonsense Fortunately I have such ability and found the film to be a delightful charmer br br Best Quote Bob Redding How s your head Elvira I haven t had any complaints
To be honest I watched this movie only because of my pubert needs I mean I couldn t get women at my age I was 9 or 10 so I thought watching Elvira s cleavage was the closet thing to sex br br I ended up having a great time with this cult classic about horror comedy Halloween parties sassy humor and some sexy evil displayed by Elvira br br They just don t make movies like this anymore It had the feeling of an amateur effort mixed with a late night cable talk show host style br br The truth is that it generated plenty of fans because of it s humor and the ability to perform by Cassandra br br This is classic that reminds me of the good days of USA Up All Night
Since the start of her career in the 70 s and vastly throughout the exuberant 80 s Elvira Cassandra Peterson has grown into a modest icon and genuine cult figure in the world of horror bad monster movies While Ms Peterson has taken on various supporting roles in motion pictures covering a wide variety in genres it was her TV character Elvira that brought her the most fame Part of her charm and respect from the fans lies in the fact she never turned her back on the horror genre that made her famous unlike many other big name actors actresses that like to distantiate themselves from their early work I ve seen only bits pieces of her TV performances but her cameo role in Ghoultown s recent tribute song Mistress of the Dark really encouraged me to check out more of her stuff One thing had been clear to me already long before this music video Over the years Elvira had become a force of influence herself by the time the mid 80 s came around br br And in 1988 after films like Fright Night and TerrorVision incorporated homages to and spoofs on her TV work it finally happened Elvira Mistress of the Dark the motion picture Now I had seen the trailer for it already back in the VHS rental days but it took me until last week to finally see the actual film A few years ago I did manage to watch Elvira s Haunted Hills made in 2001 but for some reason it didn t impress me all that much Was it really that forgettable or should I give it another watch I actually really do feel like re watching it now as this first Elvira film from 88 really convinced me Though perhaps partly responsible for making this film work might be Sam Egan and John Paragon with their contributions to the script there really is no way to deny it Cassandra Peterson has a great feel for comedy she also co wrote the screenplay br br When Elvira learns she s one of the beneficiaries of a Great Aunt she never heard of before she takes it as the long cherished opportunity to start up her own show in Las Vegas Out to claim her rightfully inherited money she travels to a quiet New England town But the uptight townspeople of Falwell are in for a treat In less than no time she manages to shock and insult all noteworthy inhabitants of the conservative little town with her often unintentionally provocative behaviour To make things worse her inheritance turns out not to be what she expected A rundown mansion a cookbook and a poodle But what she doesn t know and her evil uncle Vincent Albot does is that her Great Aunt was a witch and the cookbook contains recipes to concoct the most hellishly dark powers imaginable And if you haven t turned off the movie yet by the time Elvira has cooked up her first dish from the recipe book then rest assured you re going to sit out this ride with a smile on your face br br It s surprising how a script rigged together with boob jokes witty one liners movie references inside jokes and bade taste merriment also manages to tell a coherent story Simple of course but coherent While other movies heavily relying on gag like situations often make you loose track of the story completely like the Naked Gun films for example this film doesn t A lot of horror comedies were being produced during the 80 s but not a lot of them actually worked Let alone a horror spoof that doesn t derail at some point Killer Party although I m grateful for this one going completely bonkers during the finale or becomes too tedious too quickly Saturday the 14th Although Elvira is more comedy than horror it doesn t loose track of what it s doing and consistently builds up towards a mildly grotesque finale complete with a supernatural showdown in the streets of Falwell between newborn witch Elvira and evil uncle wizard Talbot including a real honest to god witch hunt and Elvira s very own burn at the stake moment br br I m telling you there s no power in hell that could make this movie unfunny One of the first giggles I got was during the opening credits already when Daniel Greene s name appeared Daniel who Oh yes I recognized his name and later on his dim witted macho face How can one not forget Daniel Greene once you ve seen Atomic Cyborg aka Fists of Steel But if you haven t seen Atomic Cyborg then I m sorry but you won t be able to laugh with his face in this one And on a side note I never could have imagined Elvira looking this cool while ignorantly driving away from a gas station Even Robert Rodriguez could not have made that shot look any better
Elvira Cassandra Peterson is the host of a cheap horror show After she finds out that her dead aunt has left her some stuff elvira goes to England to pick it up hoping it will be some money But to her horror elvira finds out that all her aunt has left her is her house her dog and a cookbook Elvira decides to settle in the house anyways but with her striking dark looks and her stunning features she will not be able to live in peace All the neighbours are now turning the whole town against her and with Elvira s outrageous attitude and looks everyone better watch out because Elvira is on Fire I really enjoyed this movie it s really fun to watch get Elvira into all these adventures she s just great The whole movie puts you into a halloween mood sure it s silly and the jokes are cheap but it s a pleasure to watch it I would give Elvira Mistress Of The Dark 8 10
I suck at gratuitous Boob references so i m just going to write a plainly flat no pun intended review I love Elvira not in a I m going to shoot the pres just to impress jodi foster fanatical way But suffice to say I think she rocks The movie is played like a 50 s horror film only alot more fun look for the Leasurely stroking of the ankle reference to know what I mean what relay shines through in the movie is Elvira s or should that be cassandras absolute charm i first saw this movie at the tender age of 8 and have seen it contless times since I realy should get around to buying a copy the videostore version is looking a little worse for the wear If any other fans of the movie want to e mail me about it feel free br br p s another great performance from Edie McClurg chastedy pariah an actress who never gets the attention she deserves
when my sister said this movie was gonna be good i had second thoughts but i watched it and it was actually funny basically the movie is made of a weird girl who goes to a small town where no one likes her and she just wants to go there and get the reading of her aunts will don so she can go but its not all that easy In this movie you will come across hilarious humor a witch a book of spells recopies a mentally challenged uncle and a dog You will understand the meaning of the word freak a after anyways i hope you run right out and try to find this really old movie hope you like it in total i will have to give it a 0 no I m totally joking ill give it a 9 hope you understand that you will laugh you will scream and you may just be offended br br love yours truly Dakota you can email me at dakota_loves_it hot mail com if you wanna
This film is fun if your a person who likes a good campy feature film every now and then By no means is this movie fine cinema but if you dont take things too seriously and can laugh at yourself once in a while Elvira is a good frownbuster
There are two things that I like about Elvira and they re both bigger than she is and she keeps them covered up her wit and her talent A movie is the best thing to show off how funny she can be or how she commands attention Looking like a combined clone of Morticia Adams and Anna Nicole Smith she inherits a distant relative s estate only to discover that she is really the heiress of the occult The comedy in this movie is the best thing about it but it could have been a lot more scary and chilling It s mostly a campy fare with as many bad horror movie references in it such as the rioting mob or the fleeing heroine who trips and stumbles on her heels My favorite part is when she uses her marvelous endowments to break the chains keeping her locked in the cemetary The ending is sappingly sweet as if it were written by the Bradys but the Las Vegas act at the end seems too grandiose for this type of movie
elvira mistress of the dark is one of my fav movies it has every thing you would want in a film like great one liners sexy star and a Outrageous story if you have not seen it you are missing out on one of the greatest films made i can t wait till her new movie comes out
What can one say about Elvira that hasn t already been said in the world s press The classic comedienne that IS Elvira delivers in her first full length big budget comedy masterpiece br br From the very first movie frame thingy Elvira packs an acting punch that clearly says Film Great eat your heart out Bette Davis See a forlorn Elvira see an excitable Elvira see a jealous Elvira see a murderous Elvira You can do nothing but marvel at her acting prowess br br At the heart of this comedy masterpiece is Elvira s desire for Las Vegas show stardom Despite putting the boob back in the boobtube as a horror hostess with the mostest Elvira finds the small screen constrictive emotionally and PHYSICALLY Nuff said she packs up her kitbag and heads East a hotdog in one hand and a letter from her Aunt s lawyer outlining her inheritance windfall in the other br br I ve seen this movie so many times I can almost recite it verbatim verbatim would just be showing off br br Grab a copy laugh yourself silly learn the lines br br Why she didn t win the Best Actress Oscar for this role is beyond me
I think that this movie is very fun and horror I love Elvira and I like this movie It s very pity that second part of this wonderful movie had no success because it very funny like a first part I also regret that besides of this movie I have no seen Cassandra Peterson in other films I think that she is amazing actress with big potential I hope that II ll see her in future in the third part of Elvira s adventures Cassandra Peterson is one of my favorite comedy actresses Cassandra if you read this know that you are the best and my heart will be with you You can rely on me What can I more add This is cool and classical movie
OK I saw this in the theaters when it came out and I don t know why I haven t seen it since but I ended up on this page because I found myself thinking about this film again I don t know why But the fact that I remember it speaks volumes br br Comedy is hard much harder than any drama Doing it right makes it seem easy but doing it wrong is there anything worse than a bad comedy Steve Martin pay attention you are falling in this category again for some reason br br Elvira Mistress Of The Dark must have done it right for me to remember this movie fondly Done at a quick pace with tongue in cheek and knowing it isn t the Philedelphia Story it entertains from start to finish Brain Donors is another that fits right in this category sans most of the gratuitous boob jokes br br One point of contention the ending It seems the writers director had no idea how to finish a comedy The ending tries to be a love story somewhat undermining the quirky fast paced dialogue up to that point Then there is the tassle scene Whereas this has to be seen male opinion it is so over the top and out of place it s like a shock One more rewrite for the ending was needed br br This is not comedy genius like Spinal Tap or The Producers or The Holy Grail But if you don t try to dissect it and just let the puns and sappy fun come to you you ll laugh I guarantee it
Elvira Mistress of the Dark is just that a campy concoction of fun sex appeal horror and comedy all poured into a low cut black gown and toped with a sky high black bouffant hair do This movie is sure to delight any fan of Elvira s It takes you upclose and personal with Elvira and probes deep into her um past revealing her enormous ancestry br br The movie takes you on a ride with Elvira as she goes from TV Horror Hostess with the Mostess to her home town of Fallwell Mass to claim her inheritance from a deceased Great Aunt Where she encounters a stuffy town a studly cinema owner a creepy Great Uncle who seems to be after her for more than her good looks A slew of high school kids that immediately love her and a town board who are will do anything to get her out of town even if it means burning her at the stake Watch Elvira woo the kids stalk the stud avoid her creepy Great Uncle and thumb her nose at the stuffy uptight preservatives who have no kind words for her in Elvira Mistress of the Dark br br As Elvira would say I guarantee it ll be a scream screams in background Whoa Good thing I didn t say it d be a gas
This has to be one of my favourite flicks unlike the weak Elvira s Haunted Hills anyway I love the way the movie is a goth com Wizard of Oz story br br Elvira is a goth Dorothy who is stranded in an unfamiliar town after the death of a Good Witch elviras Aunt Morgana she inherits a Ruby ring which is extremely powerful and sought after by the Bad Warlock Her uncle She befriends four Characters whom she inadvertently helps grow throughout the movie all the while with a dog in tow There is a show down with her uncle the wicked witch of the West where Elvira realises that she has the strength within her and ends up defeating him In the end she gets sent off by the towns folk after winning over their hearts and finally gets to her destination Las Vegas Dorothy s home in Kansas br br There are many references made to the wizard of oz throughout the movie she and her uncle both quote lines relevant to their parallel characters Elvira Youe must be aunt Em and you must be uncle Remus There s no place like home there s no place like home Bad uncle Vinny I ll get you my pretty and your little dog too br br There is a sign that Elvira passes when first on her road trip which mentions the state of Kansas br br But aside from this the fact that one of the sequences she ripped off um I mean was inspired by FlashDance is pure genius and if you don t roll around laughing at her titty twirling at the end of her very 80 s Las Vegas show then you haven t got a camp bone in your body This movie is a Cult Camp Classic
This film is pure Elvira and shows her at her breast I mean best The story co written by Cassandra Peterson Elvira s alter ego is inspiring and captivating and is brought to life by Elvira s wit and charm The viewer gets an opportunity to see Elvira in a whole new light as she struggles with the prejudices of the people of Fallwell Massachusetts where she has travelled from Los Angeles in order to attend the reading of her Great Aunt Morganna s will and at the same time tries to help the long suffering teenagers who have been deprived of fun by the matriarchal Chastity Pariah and the rest of the town council She also has to deal with her attraction to Bob Redding the owner of the local cinema and another woman Patty who has her eye on Bob as well but is not nearly as deserving of his love as Elvira And later in the movie she also faces the complications of being descended from a major metaphysical celebrity and the charges of witchcraft brought against her which mean that she will be burnt at the stake Elvira manages to be both sexy and vulnerable streetwise and naive in this film while cracking risque jokes and delivering off beat lines with double meanings br br This movie is inspiring because it gives out the message of never giving up on yourself and always trying to follow your dreams In the end Elvira s dreams finally come true which is the best thing that could happen to this wonderfully unique and determined woman br br I ve seen this movie countless times and I never ever get tired of it There are no unnecessary scenes and I found myself captivated throughout the whole movie A review will not do justice to the actual movie so I can just tell you to PLEASE watch it because it is one of the best movies ever made Meanwhile I wish you unpleasant dreams
Those who are not familiar with Cassandra Peterson s alter ego Elvira then this is a good place to start br br Elvira Mistress of the Dark starts off with our heroine with the gravity defying boobs receiving a message It seems that a great aunt of hers has died and that she needs to be present for the reading of the will Anxious to raise money for a show she wants to open in Las Vegas she decides to go in hopes of getting lots and lots of money br br Unfortunately the place she has to go is the town of Fallwell Massachusetts Having to stay a spell due to her car breaking down she finds out that her great aunt left her 3 things a house a dog and a cookbook The town residents have mixed reactions the teens like her the women hate her and the men lust after her Although trying to remain moral pillars of the community Her worst problem turns out to be her great uncle Vincent W Morgan Sheppard because he wants her cookbook Seems that the cookbook is a book of spells that will make him a more powerful warlock br br The film is actually pretty funny with Peterson a k a Elvira using her endowments and sexiness as a joke And don t forget tomorrow we re showing the head with two things I mean the thing with two heads Especially funny as Edie McClurg as Chastity Pariah the woman that works her hardest to keep the town in line but ends up looking ridiculous The picnic scene is the perfect example Deserves a peek The film not her boobs of course
OK this movie is stupid I mean that in a good way though It was stupid on purpose and was one of the better stupid movies I ve seen The jokes and gags are purposefully bad but delivered in a way that it struck all the right notes with me The supporting characters were pretty shallow and mediocre There is a pretty weak plot but it works just fine br br Elvira s character is the focus here She is lovable and adorable Cassandra Petersen has a world of acting talent that just glows in this movie On top of that acting talent she had physical attributes which were frankly stunning Few men could disagree with that The parts that show off her figure were also some of the funnier scenes in the movie br br I had a smile ear to ear from the first scene to the last br br Highly recommended to fans of comedy and to fans of beautiful women I wish they had made a dozen more Elvia movies

Elvira Mistress Of The Dark is a sort of Harper Valley P T A with touches of the supernatural Elvira Cassandra Peterson walks off her job as television horror movie hostess after the new station s owner gets fresh with her She s now relying on a Las Vegas show to carry her through but learns she needs to come up with more money to get the show started Things look hopeless to raise that money until she receives notice of her aunt s death which then takes Elvira to Massachusetts for the reading of the will A house in need of repairs a dog and a cookbook are all that is left to her by her aunt and again it seems Elvira is having trouble coming up with the money for the Las Vegas show The adults of the small and narrow minded town make things worse by making things more difficult for Elvira Only the local hunk Daniel Greene and a group of teenagers will befriend her Elvira s Uncle Vinnie W Morgan Sheppard presses to make a deal with Elvira for the cookbook but Elvira soon learns of her powerful heritage that includes spellcasting and a couple very effective casseroles Elvira no longer wants to sell the cookbook to her uncle but he is determined to get his hands on it knowing of its power Elvira then faces being burned at the stake on the town s old charge of witchcraft and the showdown between her and her uncle The plot is pretty simple but the humor and well developed characters keep it moving at a nice pace Elvira Mistress Of The Dark is full of cute gross bawdy and clever humor carried through by the many sight gags puns props songs and parodies The film s touches of the occult make this one of the best horror parodies ever made It is a well made film with terrific acting by all performers including Edie McClurg and Jeff Conaway of Grease There are also nice special effects Many people including myself wondered if the Elvira character could carry a feature film and the answer is delightfully YES
I don t doubt that the critics panned this movie especially the artsy fartsys who need a laxative This is a great vehicle movie in the tradition of Abbot Costello or more recently Don Knotts It won t shake the world or change movies forever What it will do is entertain When all is said done that s the most important thing anyway Watch this movie forget your troubles It even has a simple kind moral message at no extra charge I always loved Elvira s TV show when I lived in LA She did not really steal her schtick from Vampira any more than Vampira did from the original Theda Bara This sort of mythic character belongs to whoever does it best Cassandra Peterson does it best Long live Elvira we need more of these kind of movies There are never enough The villain William Morgan Sheppard was also excellent He exudes a wonderful refined malice I could find no technical faults The execution is as close to flawless as the art form gets My profound compliments to the director James Signorelli all his crew
This tender beautifully crafted production delved deep down bitter sweet into my being The irreverent pupils the life embittered bus driver and the teachers personalities present a subliminal debate as the story unveils The adult characters all seem familiar my teachers my bus driver each one of their opinions so plausible and well known When a key incident happens on the bus we are sent on a circuit of viewpoints All the time the babble of teenage energy is only just kept under control by the organisers of the trip Mr Harvey is experiencing much pain throughout He reminds me of war damaged teachers I did not understand when I was an irreverent pupil br br Rhidian Brook and the producers deserve much acclaim for this well shaped British film The acting unblemished the scenes appropriate it should be widely available yet does not seem to have been given the right opportunity
Why did they make them so big Why didn t they just give the money to the poor The question about cathedrals was asked by a student to Mr Harvey during a school field trip to Salisbury Cathedral That s a good question he replied Partly to inspire them to get them to look up with awe I m not sure that cathedrals have that impact on everyone but this movie certainly had that impact on me It was awesome br br It didn t start out that way For a while it seemed to be little more than a depiction of well a school field trip to Salisbury Cathedral If you ve ever been on a high school field trip to anywhere this is basically it You have a group of largely disinterested kids just happy to be out of school for a day the bus driver who s driven crazy by them and some teachers trying desperately to keep it all under control Been there done that got the t shirt was my initial reaction I figured that in the end this was going to be a typical story of a teacher managing to inspire a group of disinterested students YAWN But it turns out to be so much more Timothy Spall was brilliant as Mr Harvey a sombre unsmiling teacher with a strange fascination for cathedrals Over the course of the movie his story slowly comes out and becomes the focal point of the story We also get introduced to some of the troubled students most notably Helen also brilliantly played by Nathalie Press who s into self mutilation br br This isn t a religious movie but it includes some powerful reflections on religious themes When Harvey s colleague Jonathon played by Ben Miles says I don t care what anyone believes as long as they don t try to force it on anyone else Harvey replies that isn t tolerance it s indifference which is in fact in my opinion what often passes for religious tolerance in our society There are scenes of reconciliation between various characters and the final scene of the movie was brilliant As Harvey climbs back on the bus director Susanna White has the camera slowly pan upwards so that the final shot is simply of the sky hearkening back to Harvey s comment that the purpose of the cathedral is to get people to look up in awe The cathedral accomplishes its goal We look up into the universe in awe seeking something greater than ourselves however we choose to define it This is a very powerful and very inspiring movie 9 10
Although this was not without its faults this drama was a fitting one to be shown around Easter time It reminded us of our spiritual selves and showed that behind our facades we often hide our deepest sufferings and experiences There was so much to enjoy in the drama not least the rapping teenagers who provided a better musical accompaniment to the drama than the rather poor sound score in the background The acting was excellent and Timothy Spall was once again superb The climax was very satisfying if rather simplistic Timothy Spall s letting go of his long dead wife s suicide was credible and mirrored well the feelings of despair that were present in the teenage girl who self harmed The resolution between the graffiti boy and the Muslim was gratifying but less believable A wonderful drama which left myself and my husband felling that the evening had been well spent Congratulations
Mr Harvey Lights a Candle is anchored by a brilliant performance by Timothy Spall br br While we can predict that his titular morose up tight teacher will have some sort of break down or catharsis based on some deep down secret from his past how his emotions are unveiled is surprising Spall s range of feelings conveyed is quite moving and more than he usually gets to portray as part of the Mike Leigh repertory br br While an expected boring school bus trip has only been used for comic purposes such as on The Simpsons this central situation of a visit to Salisbury Cathedral in Rhidian Brook s script is well contained and structured for dramatic purposes and is almost formally divided into acts br br We re introduced to the urban British range of racially and religiously diverse kids with their uniforms I couldn t tell if this is a private or public school as they gather the rapping black kids the serious South Asians and Muslims the white bullies and mean girls but conveyed quite naturally and individually The young actors some of whom I recognized from British TV such as Shameless were exuberant in representing the usual range of junior high social pressures Celia Imrie puts more warmth into the supervisor s role than the martinets she usually has to play br br A break in the trip leads to a transformative crisis for some while others remain amusingly oblivious We think like the teacher portrayed by Ben Miles of Coupling that we will be spoon fed a didactic lesson about religious tolerance but it s much more about faith in people as well as God which is why the BBC showed it in England at Easter time and BBC America showed it in the U S over Christmas br br Nathalie Press who was also so good in Summer of Love has a key role in Mr Harvey s redemption that could have been played for movie of the week preaching but is touching as they reach out to each other in an unexpected way unfortunately I saw their intense scene interrupted by commercials br br While it is a bit heavy handed in several times pointedly calling this road trip a pilgrimage this quiet film was the best evocation of good will towards men than I ve seen in most holiday themed TV movies
if you have a chance of seeing this film do see it it s quite shocking in parts and really makes you think about so many important issues but it s not didactic in my opinion it s a piece of art beautifully filmed fine music of many styles the typically impressive level of acting that one has come to expect from BBC Drama Nathalie Press billed as Natalie Press is convincing in her role as depressed teenager exploited by a male classmate Celia Imrie has that beautifully reassuring quality that gives the sometimes unnerving action stability and the viewer comfort in the knowledge that someone out there is actually normal but the real star as always is Timothy Spall surely one of the greatest actors of our time
Amazing acting music A simple and clear plot but it drew me in and kept me captivated all the way through I don t know why it was so fantastic but it simply was So many of the characters were so real It moved me and made me think I would like to watch more like this br br The idea of a school trip as a forum for such an amazing plot was a genius idea and so many of the people were like people were like those encountered every day by teachers in the classroom br br The film tackles issues of religion prejudice drugs friendship memories difficult experiences and simple the diversity of life itself
A fine effort for an Australian show which is probably not surprising seeing as there seems to be somewhat of a resurgence in quality Aussie drama dare i compare this show to the brilliance of love my way no but it is reminiscent of early secret life of us the cast is great gibney works her magic in the first two episodes i have seen the British cast is strong also especially the callum and lizzie characters but abe forsythe may be the saving light not that it needs saving if this show is to get another season i wasn t a fan of his performance in the awesomely awesome marking time mini series a few years back but he was great as hal in always greener its also good to see brooke satchwell again lets hope the show keeps improving with each episode
Tripping Over I must say at first I was a little disappointed in the first few episodes but having faith in the show and Abe Forsythe s unquestionable talent I continued to watch I can safely say I m now glad that I did The story did develop quite well and all the characters have a strong base and most don t have any information missing br br The only thing I can fault in this production is the somewhat annoying voice and pronunciation possessed by the character Lizzie br br Some good acting coupled with a stellar plot really gets this show over the line Here s to hoping for another season
Finally we get a TV series where we get to see the acting talent Episode one was excellent The script gave us a little more than usual yeah there was still the i m not your father i m your father and omigod you cheated on me rubbish but the script allowed the actors to actually feel and live those real moments rather than show us what it would feel like if like so many TV soaps do br br The camera work also gave us a little more than usual there were no boring shots of repeated angles for hours yet there was no unnecessary shots inside shots or hand held camera crap to add an artistic edge it gave us what we needed to see and also some beautiful scenery pictures as well br br Nothing was over dramatised or melodramatic they were real people in a real place dealing with real situations the show lacked nothing in drama and was completely relevant It was SUCH a relief to be exposed to real acting and so nice to let our country see just how talented our actors can be when given a real script a real opportunity Thank you Tony Tilse Sam Miller channel ten and all cast and crew wonderful work please continue what you are doing your efforts are much appreciated and do not go unnoticed
Saw this in the theater in 86 and fell out of my chair laughing more than once Beirut What do you know about Beirut Beirut he s the best damn baseball that ever lived br br You know how it s going to end but it has a great time getting there The training scenes are very funny but the best scene may be the one when Jack and Reno are attempting to watch the Falcons v Vikings Monday Night Football game while attempting a make up dinner with their wives br br Williams and Russell seem to have a lot of fun with this one and it s too bad that it s overlooked as a top notch comedy
Kurt Russell is at his best as the man who lives off his past glories Reno Hightower Robin Williams is his polar opposite in a rare low key performance as Jack Dundee He dropped the Big Pass in more ways than one br br You ll see some of the most quotable scenes ever put into one film as Jack hisses at a rat Reno poses and the call of the caribou goes out br br Don t miss this classic that isn t scared to show football in the mud the way it should be played
For all of the Has Beens or Never Was s or for the curious this film is for you Ever played a sport or wondered what it felt like after the lights went down and the crowd left this film explores that and more br br Robin Williams Jack Dundee is a small town assistant banker in Taft CA whose life has been plagued by a miscue in a BIG rival high school football game 13 years ago when he dropped the pass that would have won over Bakersfield their Arch Rival that takes great pleasure in pounding the Taft Rockets season after season Kurt Russell Reno Hightower was the Quarterback in that famous game and is the local legend that now is a van repair specialist whose life is fading into lethargy like the town of Taft itself br br Williams gets an idea to remake history by replaying the GAME He meets with skeptical resistance so he goes on a one man terror spree and literally paints the town orange yellow and black to raise the ire of the residents to recreate THE game After succeeding the players from that 1972 team reunite and try to get in shape to practice which is hysterical The game is on Bakesfield is loaded with all of the high tech gadgets game strategies and sophisticated training routines Taft is drawing plays in the mud with sticks stones and bottle caps what a riot Does Taft overcome the odds does Robin Willians purge the demons from his bowels does Kurt Russell rise from lethargy watch The Best of Times for one of the BEST viewing experiences ever br br One of Robin Williams best UNDERSTATED performances the chemistry between Robin and Russell is magic And who is Kid Lester br br Holly Palance and Pamela Reed give memorable performances as the wives of Williams and Russell Succeeds on Many Levels A 10
hi I m from Taft California and i like this movie because it shows how us little town people love our sports football is the main thing in Taft and this movie shows just how important it is i personally think they should make another one but instead of actors use us kids to play the games well show you our determination we ve beat Bakersfield every game for the past 6 years and since I m a senior next year its my last chance and then its college we ve had running backs lead the state and I m next if you want to know me I m kyle Taylor and i average seven to eight yards a carry and about five times a game ill break away on a 75 or around that yard run so check us out at our website and go to our sports page bye
Robin Williams does his best to combine comedy and pathos but comes off a bit shrill Donald Moffat is too one note as his father in law Jeff Bridges is excellent though as the quarterback and Holly Palance and Pamela Reed are marvelous carrying the film through most of its rough spots It fills time nicely but is little more than that
I love this movie but the music at all the alumni gatherings is just stupid br br The fateful game took place in 1972 That means that the protagonists graduated in 1972 But almost all of the music played at the dances etc is from the 1950s and very early 1960s br br Having just attended my 30th high school reunion I can assure you that the last music to be played at a reunion or dance of former high school people is their parents music br br I understand the difficulty of finding relevant 1970s music we all know what a desolate time it was musically But it wasn t completely bereft and the producers of the film should have taken more care I found those dance scenes very jarring to my otherwise willing suspension of disbelief in the rest of the film br br This was a bad director and or producer decision
The film did not do well at the box office br br I saw it in a sneak preview br br I have always enjoyed the film br br I live in 1 of the cities mentioned in the film where past players moved to br br Not the best film ever put to screen but enjoyable br br Robin did well with his role br br Best line of the film at the beginning by Robin s character Jack I was that SOB Cleaned up here as not to offend anyone br br Was glad when it came to DVD a few years back in the wide screen letter box format br br I am not a football fan or a real sports fan But you do not need to be one to like this film
Robin Williams and Kurt Russell play guys in their 30 s who put their marraiges in jeopardy by deciding Russell somewhat reluctantly to replay their heartbreaking tie with rival Bakersfield years after the fact Williams is ok but Russell is flat out great as legendary Taft quarterback Remo Hightower Holly Palance does a nice and attractive turn as Williams wife who could live without this rematch Film is worth watching just to see the famed Remo in action Highly recommended
Spoiler This movie is about such a concept Williams will go to any low in order to replay the football game that haunts his life Russel plays the ex jock who peaked in high school Finally the under dog get its shot and Williams can save face instead of being the clown A great reverse tragedy 7 10
The Best of Times is one of the great sleepers of all time The setup does not tax your patience the development is steady the many intertwined relationships are lovingly established the gags and bits all work and all are funny There is lots of sentimentality Kurt Russell playing Reno Hightower puts in one of his best performances and Robin Williams playing Jack Dundee is sure footed as ever The cast also includes many great supporters Jack s wife is played by Jack Palance s daughter who is lovely as is Reno s wife who is a great comedian I can t tell you how many times I ve watched this movie how many times I have enjoyed it and how often I wish that more people could see it
Why did this movie fail commercially It s got a sharp script by Ron Shelton and great performances by Kurt Russell and especially Robin Williams in a brilliant manic nerd turn that s different from any of his other work A great renter
Kurt Russell is at his best as the man who lives off his past glories Reno Hightower Robin Williams is his polar opposite in a rare low key performance as Jack Dundee He dropped the Big Pass in more ways than one br br You ll see some of the most quotable scenes ever put into one film as Jack hisses at a rat Reno poses and the call of the caribou goes out br br Don t miss this classic that isn t scared to show football in the mud the way it should be played note to the NFL
Have you ever in your life gone out for a sport s activity tried your best and then found yourself in an important segment of it where for a brief moment you were given a chance to be a hero and a champion and failed I believe many of us have had that moment in our lives This is the premise of the movie The Best of Times In this story a middle age banker named Jack Dundee Robin Williams suffers from the deep melancholy of a football mistake which happened years ago is inspired to re play the game again In order to accomplish this he must convince the once great football quarterback Reno Hightower Kurt Russell to make a comeback For Reno who is satisfied with his present lot in life see s no need to change the past record which get s better as he ages Added to both their problem is the fact years have passed and in addition both their marriages are floundering and in need of re vamping Not easy when his Father in law Donald Moffat habitually reminds him of the biggest drop Nevertheless Dundee is persistent and will do anything to try and correct the greatest blunder of his life Great fun for anyone wishing to enjoy their youth again
I guess that everyone has to make a comeback at some point And that s exactly what embarrassed Taft resident Jack Dundee Robin Williams intends to do in The Best of Times Yep the man who went all crazy with the radio in Good Morning Vietnam is playing football In this case he seeks to replay a game that cost his high school a prestigious title But ex teammate Reno Hightower Kurt Russell isn t just going to go along with it so easily br br Granted it s not the best movie for either man But Williams and Russell are actually a pretty good comedy team And some of the names in this movie are likely to give you the giggles to say the least Check it out
Saw this in the theater in 86 and fell out of my chair laughing more than once Beirut What do you know about Beirut Beirut he s the best damn baseball player who ever lived br br You know how it s going to end but it has a great time getting there The training scenes are very funny but the best scene may be the one when Jack and Reno are attempting to watch the Falcons v Vikings Monday Night Football game while attempting a make up dinner with their wives br br Williams and Russell seem to have a lot of fun with this one and it s too bad that it s overlooked as a top notch comedy
This movie surprised me it had good one liners and laughs a nonstop action packed storyline with tons of gun action and explosions This movie surprisingly had a lot of good twists and turns The plot is solid despite what others may think it kept my interest the whole time right up till the very end In conclusion this is a great way for an action movie buff to spend time on
This movie has everything you want from an action movie Explosions shootouts bad guys and worse guys It is fun to see James Belushi using his humor to get out of the trouble he has gotten himself in to since he stole 12 million dollars from the ultimate big boss The Skipper Does this sounds cheesy Of course it is But boy did I have fun watching this movie It is a whole lot better than all the direct to DVD garbage that is made nowadays If you can get over the silly plot than you will find out that this movie has quite a few surprises in store You could argue about the twists being predictable But the fast pace of this movie doesn t give you time too think too much of them which is a blessing since this movie is not about revealing the ultimate twist But more about the journey to that moment Only the title is a bit misleading and that could be the reason why so many people hated this movie They probably expected a movie about mobsters in stead of some crooks double crossing each other Pure fun
What a good film Made Men is a great action movie with lots of twists and turns James Belushi is very good as an ex hood who has stolen 12 million from the boss who has to fend of the gangsters hillbillies his wife and the local sheriff Timothy Dalton you wont be disappointed jump on board and enjoy the ride 8 out of 10
This movie surprised me in a good way From the box I got the impression that it was an action thriller but it was too funny to be a thriller even though it was somewhat exciting br br There s a lot of nice one liners and funny situations in this movie and James Belushi was born to do Bill Manucci he does a great job The rest of the cast ain t half bad either and especially Timothy Dalton is a treat br br The story can get pretty confusing at times as new characters shows up during the film Things get more complicated as nobody seldom tells the truth about things If you don t pay attention things might get a bit messy in the end but I really liked it br br Louis Morneau isn t all that well known but he has done a perfectly OK job with this one and I never really grew impatient while watching the movie br br Made men is well worth checking out
I bought this movie a few days ago and thought that it would be a pretty shitty film But when i popped it into the DVD player it surprised me in a very good way James Belushi plays very well as Bill The Mouth Manuccie But especially Timothy Dalton plays a very good roll as the Sheriff The end scene in the house of Bill is very excellent good camera work nice dialogues and very good acting Bill The Mouth Manuccie has stolen 12 Million Dollars from the Mafia Together with his wife he lives in South Carolina in a witness protection program But the Mafia tracks him down and wants the 12 Million Dollar Bill can only trust the only person he knows inside out himself
i was hoping this was going to be good as a fan of timothy dalton s james bond and although it wasn t his deserved 3rd bond outing it was a laugh Belushi brought some good humour to his part and dalton hammed it up nicely but was probably underused his part was liked a camped up version of jack nicholson in a few good men the other brit in it was a bit shocking but overal it was a laugh
Great entertainment from start to the end Wonderful performances by Belushi Beach Dalton Railsback Some twists and many action scenes The movie was made for me Funny lines in the screenplay good music Dalton as the tough sheriff and Railsback as redneck villain I must recommend this film to every action adventure fan 10 10
In another one of Bugs Bunny s hare raisingly wacky shorts the famous leporid works in a department store display case when owner Gildersleeve decides to stuff him Of course this proves nearly impossible as Bugs apparently knows the store better than Gildersleeve and knows when to cross dress As always they keep everything coming at top speed and so you have to wonder how hilarious this cartoon must have seemed when it first debuted Among other things Hare Conditioned is a fine example of how the Looney Tunes looked in the 40s before the Termite Terrace crowd polished them But don t get me wrong the cartoons were still really good after the refined forms arrived br br Anyway this is a great one br br Leporids are rabbits and hares
A great Bugs Bunny cartoon from the earlier years has Bugs as a performer in an window display at a local department store After he s done for the day the manager comes in to tell him that he ll be transferring soon Bugs is happy to oblige into he figures out that the new job is in taxidermy and that taxidermy has to do with stuffing animals Animals like say a certain rabbit This causes a battle of wits between the rascally rabbit and his now former employer I found this short to be delightful and definitely one of the better ones of the early 1940 s It still remains as funny nearly 60 years later This animated short can be seen on Disc 1 of the Looney Tunes Golden Collection Volume 2 br br My Grade A
Is it a good idea to use live animals for department store window displays br br No and here s why br br In Hare Conditioned the sale that Bugs is helping promote is over and the store manager Nelson is transferring him to a new department taxidermy Naturally Bugs objects and the fun begins br br using nearly every department in the store children s wear sports shoes costumes women s nightgowns don t ask Bugs comes out on top at every turn even referring to the manager as The Great GilderSNEEZE Even when trapped in the confines of an elevator Bugs makes the best of the situation br br Director Jones is on top of his pictorial game as always as are Blanc as Bugs natch and Nelson the manager who DOES sound like radio mainstay Gildersleeves go ask your grand parents br br And a sage word of advice when confronted by a fuzzy looking woman wanting to try on bathroom slippers always check her ears br br Ten stars for Hare Conditioner the best argument yet for animal labor laws
This along with Hare Tonic ranks as one of the best Bugs cartoons indeed one of the best Bugs ever There are some comments about how Bugs in these cartoons is basic meaning I guess that he is as yet not fully developed I actually prefer this basic version from the mid 40s Chuck Jones was the best version who is actually more rabbit sized and far more amusing than the eventual long legged version who towered over Yosemite Sam and Daffy Duck The latter day Bugs came to be too suave and sophisticated for my liking Also check out Hair Raising Hare 1946 and Rabbit Punch 1948 for great examples of classic Bugs and classic Chuck Jones
Chuck Jones s Hare Conditioned is a fast paced often hilarious cartoon Pitting Bugs Bunny against a strange yellow skinned apartment store manager who wants to have him stuffed Hare Conditioned takes full advantage of its multi purpose setting The chase takes Bugs and his pursuer through a variety of departments leading to an inspired gag in which they quickly emerge from various departments wearing whatever clothes are associated with that part of the store This great gag is trumped however by a truly inspired sequence involving elevators in which Bugs disguised as an elevator boy tricks the store manager into relentlessly getting on or off elevators at the wrong time It s a brilliant climactic set piece which unfortunately gives way to a not very funny final gag By that time however Hare Conditioned has made its mark as one of the great chase films bursting with wild energy As Bugs was becoming more refined in some of the other cartoons from this period Hare Conditioned showed that he could still be just as appealing as a more anarchic character
Jared Diamond made a point in the first episode that other peoples of the world didn t have animals to domesticate but Europeans did and that accounts for why we were able to make steel and invent complex machines It is obvious that the person who wrote this comment hasn t understood the reasoning behind this documentary or the original book Please don t ruin this great piece by your simple mindedness The reasons are far more complex than the single thing you mentioned Please read the book as is it a great source of information I enjoyed it a lot This book is even a taught as a text book at some universities
This series adds new information and background to the book and includes personal appearances by the author and by archaeologists and other anthropologists It brings the book to life and makes even more sense of the author s subsequent opus Collapse br br Diamond himself comes off as personable and caring not just a disinterested or disengaged academic This series makes it clear that his book was not just a response to a need to publish or perish as the saying goes about academe but a deeply considered answer to a question from someone he respects Why you white people got so much cargo and we have so little Because he respected the intelligence of the questioner and his community Diamond looked for an answer that didn t insult that intelligence or that community I like to think of his answer in a very simple way in the same spirit as South Park s Blame Canada Blame wheat
Having read Diamond s book I was slightly disappointed in the series but all in all it is quite informative Reading the other comments it is comforting to know that the culture warriors are hard at work seeing attacks on Western Civilization under every rug br br Is Diamond a little preachy Sure Like a lot of academics he sees his theory as the most important thing ever He uses the phrase guns germs and steel at seemingly every opportunity during the series We get it after about the first 10 minutes br br Is Diamond a little simplistic in the series Sure The part about the Spaniards in South America is particularly amusing condensing some very long complicated history down to smallpox swords and horses wrapping up the whole conquest of South America in about 15 minutes But the point remains valid these things did in fact contribute but not totally define the reasons for the Spaniard s success against the established cultures br br Is he preaching against Western Civilization in any way Nope Not a word Not to my ear All he says is that luck played a large part in determining which cultures advanced more quickly not that luck is the only reason br br In the end if you re looking for something that validates your own sense of superiority then this series is not for you But if you are interested in all of the factors than influence how societies succeed or fail this series presents a useful interpretation of the historical evidence
This is a documentary I came across by chance on the UK TV channel More4 and I have to say I found it extremely interesting and thought provoking I will also be seeking out the book that was the source material for this documentary Basically this is Professor Jared Diamond theory on why certain parts of the earth s societies prospered and others did not The argument he presents was new to me and argued about how the fortune of the right crops and the right animals that where able to domesticated is certainly a compelling one As for the documentary itself it is well shot and well narrated with not to much of the re created scenes that spoil many a modern documentary Diamond also helps by not being to condescending which is a fault of a lot of intellectuals when trying to get a message to the masses People have claimed his theory is Marxist but I do not buy this and see it more socio geologist It was also refreshing to hear an theory on the evolution of society not based around religion Highly recommended viewing
The documentary presents an original theory about Guns Germs and Steel The series graphically portray several episodes strongly supporting the theory and defend the theory against common criticism br br I was deeply puzzled to find user comments complaining about lack of new information in these series They say documentary presents information which is taught in middle school Indeed it does In fact I greatly enjoyed the original look at the information which I have known since middle school and the unexpected analysis br br So if you like knowing WHY things work if you have taken apart the telephone trying to determine how it worked if you have gone to the farm to see how farm works and how cows are milked you will enjoy this series A definite recommendation
Don t know if this contains any spoilers or not but I don t want to risk being blacklisted until the year 3462 br br I disagree entirely with the viewer comments that have described Guns Germs and Steel as politically correct and neo Marxist They cannot have watched the same series that I did br br The series I watched depicted the history of European colonisation in the Americas and southern Africa with no particular inaccuracies I saw nothing in the series that portrayed Europeans as bad people who happened to be lucky though Europeans often were lucky and there s nothing wrong with luck Neither did I see native peoples portrayed as poor little innocent things If anything the Inca was rather arrogant as you would expect any leader would be when dealing with foreigners if his country has not been conquered in living memory by any other world power br br I certainly saw nothing that could be construed as Marxist or Neo Marxist except by the most incredibly elastic of imaginations br br Otherwise many African peoples do have a built in immunity to malaria and other tropical diseases that Europeans lack At the time they were at the height of their successes the Aztec Maya and Inca civilisations were as advanced as any other in the world and as wealthy sometimes more so Aboriginal American and Khoi San populations were decimated by smallpox and other diseases introduced by Europeans just as European colonists were decimated by tropical diseases like malaria NOTE The Khoi San peoples are completely different from all other sub Saharan African peoples br br So I don t see what some of the other commentators are complaining about The only thing I can find to complain about is that the series doesn t tell me anything I did not know by the time I finished seventh grade There s really nothing new in the way of historical information in this film It does however present some nice dramatisations of events such as the conquest of the Incas the production values are very high and it fills in a few holes here and there that didn t get covered in Mrs Gruber s Sixth Hour Social Studies Class at Milan Middle School br br If you rent or buy this assuming you had a decent primary and or secondary school education you won t learn anything new but you will have an enjoyable and entertaining time reviewing what you already learned or should have learned by the time you hit high school
Rock Star INXS was the best music TV series I have ever watched It had some of the greatest rock n roll songs ever written performed by 15 very talented singers performers It also had in my opinion the most heart felt feel good surprise endings in all of reality TV It actually made me shed tears of happiness for the winner Over the 13 weeks of this televised competition the viewing audience got to know and became familiar with all of the contestants After 30 some episodes the remaining contestants seemed more like friends than just some more strangers competing against each other on a reality TV show And the fact that INXS was and still is one of the greatest rock n roll bands EVER just added to the emotional tension created by this wonderful reality series If you don t have the series recorded ROCK STAR INXS the DVD is a great alternative
As has been well documented by previous posters the real stars of Rockstar INXS and indeed it s sequel Rockstar Supernova are Paul Mirkovich Rafael Moreira Jim McGorman Nate Morton and Sasha Krivtsov Don t know who they are They are the awesome tight rockin House Band whose music savvy and talent made this show something more than a sad American Idol clone br br Remember the strings night That was musical precision and perfection if ever I ve seen it Suzie McNeil s epic rendition of Queen s Bohemian Rhapsody Ty Taylor s memorable cover of the Stones You Can t Always Get JD Fortune singing Suspicious Minds The common denominator here is the awesome House Band br br As good as INXS were in their prime they are sadly a shadow of their former selves though JD s live performance has somewhat breathed new life into their music this show is all about the HB br br Memo to producers Season Three if we re blessed enough to have it happen should be Rockstar House Band Get those boys a good lead singer and they are going places
I don t quite know how to explain Darkend Room because to summarize it wouldn t really do it justice It s a quintessentially Lynchian short film with two beautiful girls in a strange mysterious situation I would say this short is definitely more on the Mulholland Drive end of the Lynchian spectrum as opposed to The Elephant Man or The Straight Story It s hidden on Lynch s website and well worth the search
This is almost typical Lynch However What makes this film slightly unusual for Lynch is the fact that it looks very raw almost amateurish But i believe Lynch does this on purpose to give a greater sense of realism which serves to increase the intensity of surreal moments br br However a lot of Typical Lynch motifs are present such as floating camera work haunting music long excruciating pauses hanging curtains dim lights growing darker at a slow almost indiscernible pace extreme close ups themes of women in trouble over bearing incompassionate all knowing characters facing off with characters who are distraught temporarily oblivious in the dark and so on br br The performances are great and the short is thought provoking As usual Lynch leaves almost everything up to interpretation Many questions are left unanswered and this ignites the imagination br br Another brilliant effort from Lynch I only hope he makes some shorts more along the lines of his sony playstation 2 commercials They were inspired
It s a short movie from David Lynch with just 8 minutes but it got all the Lynchian ingredients It s mysterious dark inconclusive eerie and strange and before the blond girl starts to talk it s even a bit scary The soundtrack is exceptional to create this odd atmosphere because it s also sinister and mysterious br br About the setting itself it hasn t the traditional red curtains but it has socking purple painted walls which give it an equally effect of eeriness br br The plot is about a girl who s locked in a dark room and she cries for help then comes another girl who starts talking to her in a mysterious way saying she s there just because of her fault We don t know what did happen or what will happen next it ended unsolved and puzzling as a good Lynch movie must end br br It s a great short despite some amateurish acting The girls are professional actresses but I think their acting could have been better in this short
I really think that people are taking the wrong approach at this one First of all I find this short film very entertaining and interesting I just take it for what it is I think the suspense and mystery are ingenious in their insinuation upon the watcher One other thing that caught my fancy was that it immediately gets the viewer involved even though there is no clear story just hints and pauses and emotions played out by the characters that kind of give you the impression that there is a story to all that is going on No one else could have done that better than Lynch This is the essence of lynchianism at its best Sure I will agree with anyone that people that start viewing this with the desire to be entertained without any really imaginative work from the viewer s side will find themselves disappointed And in good right Lynch is not about that At least this side of Lynch is not The one that helped make Lost Highway Mulholland Dr is at full tilt here and people that just expect to be entertained like they would watching anything else will just not get what this is all about My opinion is that Darkened Room is all about messing with your animal core your instinctual self by giving you the means image sound situation by which you instinctively react It s not about pleasure of any kind it s about getting the desired reaction out of you And that my friend is pure art
Hello this little film is interesting especially for an artist film maker or music creator or a visual artist for br br One can feel and examine David s touch style straight out of a short piece of relative simplicity br br You can see the rhythmic spacing of the shots the pans and the sound elements br br Even as simple film this creation is multy layer For example there are some sounds that drone all along while others appear though subtle at certain points to support certain shots br br One can see also several types of pans some go up and down in a gentle back forth way There is diagonal pan Zooms also go back and forth sometimes br br The lightning and the composition disposition of elements in the space is as usual and obviously work of a painer artist This can be felt even in this crappy room This is to say one can make exquisite art already by the simple art of placing the look view and composing the scene Then comes the forcelines of the visuals like digonales parallels etc The light s degrad√©es and the colours although without too much research for textures as in big productions are fine too This is an artist s sketch of a sort br br All this is not calculated but done with inner feeling and this feel gives the David s touch feel to it as with any true artist
David Lynch s new short is a very Lynchian piece full of darkness tension silences discreet but very textured background music and features again two beautiful actresses a blonde and a brunette a recurrent theme in his work br br Both characters create a very intriguing slave mistress relationship that could be seen as a direct follow up to the same kind of relationship featured in Mulholland Dr br br Beautiful For Lynch fan s br br
This is a very intriguing short movie by David Lynch and saying the name David Lynch is probably enough for a lot of people This is your typical Lynch short A blonde and a brunette are in a dark room The blonde has been crying the brunette is talking in a threatening way to the blonde and that s about it br br With a lot of silent moments but with the haunting music from Angelo Badalamenti there is a strange form of suspense This short feels a little like Mulholland Dr a movie I loved and therefore I liked this one as well It is probably especially for Lynch fans but there is a chance you like this
I am going to go out on a limb and actually defend Shades of Grey as a good clip show episode which delved into the life and death struggle of Commander William Thomas Riker who was battling a terminally fatal disease br br The scenes from the flashback sequences were implemented quite well with the mood Riker was in such as when he was reliving his romantic episodes such as 11001001 Angel One and Up the Long Ladder Tragic moments were highlighted such as Tasha s death in Skin of Evil as well as elements of pulse pounding danger in Heart of Glory Conspiracy and the aforementioned Skin of Evil Riker also exhibited courage under fire by telling some humorous jokes such as An ancestor of mine was bitten by a rattlesnake once after 3 days of intense pain the snake died This episode highlighted the psychological ordeal of Will Riker under extreme duress And YES I am biased in my opinion in proclaiming Shades of Grey as a solid episode because at the time of its original airing my face was covered in sweat wondering whether or not Riker would pullout of it alive and live to see other great galactic outerspace adventures beyond the final frontier br br Of course in subsequent years I seem to have formed a singular opinion of this particular episode but if an award should go for the best clip show episode in the history of television then I believe that this episode should be highly regarded in that respect
I am watching the series back to back as fast as possible I am attempting to watch all things Star Trek This is month 3 and I am now on Season 3 of TNG and I have already gone thru DS9 in its entirety Star Trek is the greatest television phenomenon ever achieved br br Shades of Grey is the first recap episode in the TNG series Having just watched the shows these clips were fresh in my mind but I noticed how a couple of them were re shot because the film looked better Season 1 always seemed real dark and ugly to me and the actors looked silly like they didn t fit in their own skins br br The show is essentially just made of up a greatest hits of the happiest and saddest moments in Riker s life on the Enterprise up until this point The Data and Riker scene in the holo deck is a classic moment of new friendship My other favorite is when the 2nd officer on the Klingon ship challenges Riker s authority as first officer and Riker beat the living CRAP out of that Klingon Then the admiral kicks his a but good This entire episode is a heck of a reminder that a LOT of crazy great things have happened already in a mere 2 seasons with 5 more to go and a handful of movies At this point in the series they are really starting to develop the emotions that tie Riker to Deanna Troi as Imzadi Up until this point they have mentioned the fact but they have yet to exploit it Let the record show that the ST Wiki Memory Alpha claims that Imzadi means first and denotes that she has had intimate relations with Riker and also remains deeply close on an emotional one This episode further proves there will be a tense romantic interest in each other for a long time to come br br Here is the article http memory alpha org en wiki Imzadi By this point in the series production value is up to speed and Star Trek TNG is settling into the sci fi behemoth it was destined to become Watching this again as an adult I see now what GREAT ACTORS the Star Trek Universe provides They really need to make a new ST show set after all the current shows A DS9 movie would have been nice too
This is quite the gripping fascinating tragic story Quite good and for the most part pretty accurate considering it IS a TV movie rather than a documentary They did create some fictional characters and combine several actual people into one character but otherwise this is a good telling of a very tragic and dark story br br The final moments of the movie depicting the mass suicide murder are almost directly taken from an audio recording made by Jim Jones This recording was made during the final 44 minutes of the Peoples Temple s existence It is available in several places on the internet This portion of the film is almost spot on in that regard br br To sum up a documentary this is not However it does cover most of the base elements to the People s Temple story
I will never forget this film or the events that lead up to Jonestown in Guyana It just seems so tragic but needs to be told Powers Boothe give a commanding performance as the leader Rev Jim Jones from obscurity until total madness It would have won him an Academy Award easily if it was released in the movie theaters It is the kind of mini series you won t forget You won t forget the images of the cult s brutality control and obsessiveness of it s leader His rise and fall and the threat from the outside world to destroy what he considered to be paradise The mass suicide is horrifying almost unreal to anybody s imagination as to why so many people 900 went willingly or resisted JOnes orders They don t make mini series like these anymore where we re left with out mouths open and hungry to know what happened to the others
Just given the fact that it is based on the most infamous mass suicide incident of modern times would have been enough to give this 2 part 1980 made for TV film attention But the fact is that it is a superb recreation of the life of the Rev Jim Jones who built a church into a virtual empire and then encouraged it to disintegrate into a sleazy cult in which a Congressman and his entourage were assassinated and 917 cult followers committed suicide by drinking Kool Aid doused with cyanide br br Done very tastefully but horrifying enough unlike the excruciatingly sadistic CULT OF THE DAMNED GUYANA TRAGEDY features an all star cast including Ned Beatty as Rep Leo Ryan Meg Foster Randy Quaid Brad Dourif Brenda Vaccaro LeVar Burton and Madge Sinclair But it is Powers Boothe in his first big role that really stands out as Jim Jones He actually BECOMES the man and his performance is riveting and chilling Thus it is no wonder that this film still manages to attract attention after more than twenty years
Powers Booth is hypnotic as cult leader jim jones who led his Peoples Temple followers from 1953 until 1978 when he led them in a mass suicide in 1978 where over 900 died A very well done movie which may seem a little dated due to the 70s time period but well worth the time 8 of 10
I ve seen this film literally over 100 times it s absolutely jam packed with entertainment Powers Boothe gives a stellar performance As a fan of actors such as William Shatner Impulse 1974 and Ron Liebmann Up The Academy 1981 I never thought an actor could capture the intensity like Shatner and Liebmann in those roles until I saw Boothe as Jim Jones As far as I m concerned Powers Boothe IS Jim Jones this film captures his best performance
A well cast summary of a real event Well actually I wasn t there but I think this is how it may have been like I think there are two typically American standpoints evident in the film communistophobia and parallels to Adolf Hitler These should be evident to most independent observers Anyway Boothe does a great performance and so do lots of other well known actors The last twenty minutes of the film are unbearable and I mean it Anyone who can sleep well after them is abnormal That s why it s so terrible it all happened and it probably looked just like that But actually did that last scene on the air station really take place
Powers Boothe turns in a stellar performance as 1970 s cult figure Jim Jones of the Peoples Temple Jones physical likeness to Jones is uncanny and the story is acted out chillingly The movie keeps you riveted and is a must see for anyone check it out
I read a few reviews of this TV movie which all said that the film dragged on for too long and that it was basically only sensationalistic entertainment I agree that perhaps the film goes on a bit too long 2h30 would have been enough but I certainly do not think it sensationalize the subject matter Jim Jones expansive power trip and slow degradation into mental illness paranoia and drug abuse are never treated in a voyeuristic manner The movie takes its time in showing how Jones recruited followers Brenda Vaccaro s and Brad Dourif s character are stand outs in that matter but also in observing an uncanny shift in Jones perception of reality It is mind boggling to see an egalitarian left wing and compassionnate preacher become such a destructive and cruel dictator Perhaps the movie doesn t explore Jones motivations enough which can make the whole ordeal a bit superficial at times may have to do with censorship as well But Powers Boothe s mesmerizing performance makes it all come true I am not familiar with the details of the real Jim Jones life but Boothe sure makes the monster he plays believable and real The movie features many strong scenes among them the preaching messes of Jones Jones s meeting with Father Divine a remarquable James Earl Jones Congressman Leo Ryan Ned Beatty s visit to the Guyana camp and of course the suicide scene It is quite a gloomy spectable to watch and Boothe is quite commanding in those last moments Madge Sinclair shines in this scene as one of the suddenly sceptic follower and so do Veronica Cartwright as Jones wife and Brad Dourif especially when their time comes to drink the murderous potion The relative calm of the end of this scene the tasteful direction and the contrasting beauty of the natural surroundings all work in making those images quite impossible to erase from one s mind A disturbing reflection on human nature and its weaknesses Worth watching if only to keep in mind one of the truly horrific events of the 20th century Not to let it be repeated again Like ironically the inscription in Jim Jones camp Those who do not know the past are bound to repeat it
This isn t the best Bigfoot ever made but by the recent standards of Nature gone awry movies mostly showing on the Sci Fi channel this is quality stuff It has some action some humor decent F X and Bigfoot CG is used but so are some practical F X which I like br br Overall this movie is worth a watch if you are a fan of B horror sci fi and need a fix It s better than the movie Sasquatch and not a sequel to it so don t be fooled br br The acting is better than you may expect to find in a movie like this and the directing is more than adequate Expect a bit of a lul as the characters are developed but know that things will pick up If you are watching a DVD you may want to skip a chapter or two

Rented the movie as a joke My friends and I had so much fun laughing at it that I went and found a used copy and bought it for myself Now when all my friends are looking for a funny movie I give them Sasquatch Hunters It needs to be said though there is a rule that was made that made the movie that much better No talking is allowed while the movie is on unless the words are Sasquatch repeated in a chant I loved the credit at the end of the movie as well Thanks for the Jeep Tom Whoever Tom is I say thank you because without your Jeep the movie may not have been made In short a great movie if you are looking for something to laugh at If you want a good movie maybe look for something else but if you don t mind a laugh at the expense of a man in a monkey suit grab yourself a copy
Fragglerock is excellent in the way that Schindler s List was excellent A Great watch for children and adults of all genders Big noses can be seen as hinting towards phallic symbols in the same way that H R Puff N Stuff had hinted towards marijuana smoking Your kids will love this movie I enjoyed it very much as a child My father showed me this movie as a child He enjoyed it as well and pointed out that the exaggerated noses were phallic symbols Although at the time I had no clue about what those were The movie is comedy and adventure The storyline is wacky and cheerful I and you shall enjoy this together

After seeing Dick Tracy in the 6 99 bin at Future Shop I decided to give it a go with no previous knowledge and being a big fan of Mafia and Crime movies I was very surprised to see a very fun smart entertaining movie with solid performances throughout The movie moves along well it has of course another solid performance from Warren Beatty but the real standouts of the film are Al Pacino and Madonna I was happy to find out that Pacino was nominated for his performance as an over the top gangster trying to take down the city Madonna was great as the damsel in distress she really impressed me and added depth to her performance If you go in with the attitude of wanting to watch a fun smart movie with great acting and a solid script then give Dick Tracy a try I don t think you will be disappointed And Watch for the cameos from Paul Sorvino James Caan Kathy Bates and Dustin Hoffman among others
At one end of the Eighties Warren Beatty created and starred in the literate epic Reds about the founding of the Soviet Union as seen through the eyes of iconoclast radical John Reed It was a profound film both entertaining and with a message presented by an all star cast At the end of the decade Warren Beatty created another kind of epic in Dick Tracy that makes no pretense to being anything other than entertainment with a whole bunch of the best actors around just having a great old time hamming it up under tons of makeup br br That both Reds and Dick Tracy could come from the same individual speaks volumes about the range this man has as a player In this film Beatty managed to get all the famous cartoon characters from the strip and put them in one original screenplay br br The city s top mobster Big Boy Caprice is making a move to really eliminate competition The film opens with him rubbing out Lips Manlis s henchmen in a Valentine Massacre style shooting and then Lips himself being fitted for a cement overcoat But Caprice s moves are making him a target for Tracy br br In the meantime a third mysterious and faceless individual is looking to topple Caprice himself Will our hero sort out this thicket of crime br br The spirit of fun this film has is truly infectious When people like Al Pacino Dustin Hoffman Paul Sorvino William Forsythe R G Armstrong get themselves outrageously made up to look like the cartoon creations of strip author Chester Gould and then indulge in an exercise of carving the biggest slice of ham you ve got to love this film br br Al Pacino got a nomination for Best Supporting Actor but any of these guys could have it s only that Pacino as Big Boy Caprice gets the most screen time Only Beatty plays it completely straight the others all seem to play off of him Dick Tracy won Oscars for Best Art Set Design Best Song written by Stephen Sondheim and introduced by Madonna Sooner Or Later The fact he was even able to get somebody like Sondheim to write a score for this film only shows Sondheim wanted to get in on the fun As for Madonna the Material Girl does more than hold her own with all these acting heavyweights as club torch singer Breathless Mahoney br br Before this film Dick Tracy movies were consigned to the B pictures and worse as Saturday afternoon serials The only thing that rivals this all star extravaganza is a radio broadcast done for Armed Forces Radio during World War II that got to vinyl Can you believe a cast like Bing Crosby Bob Hope Frank Sinatra Dinah Shore Jimmy Durante Judy Garland Frank Morgan and the Andrews Sisters Try and find a recording of that gem br br Until then Warren Beatty s classic comic strip for the big screen will do nicely
Dick Tracy wasn t the best for many comic book fans because they wanted something with blood like Batman Dick Tracy plays the innocence of just being a comic book with villains that have severe appearance disorder and being fun Warren Beatty directs and stars as the main character that fights crime without even using super powers I have liked Dick Tracy since I was a child because of the comic atmosphere of the main colors red blue orange yellow green and black This is the perfect film for anybody to watch with their children Al Pacino is like the Jack Nicholson in Batman and plays Big Boy Caprice with zest Madonna as the babe who is the second villain in this film doesn t play the same boy toy she represents Like I said no blood obscenities sexually innuendo or anything to offend anybody
I still liked it though Warren Beatty is only fair as the comic book hero What saves this movie is the set the incredible cast and it offshoots a mediocre script I really expected something more substantial in the terms of action or plot but I got very little The main reason to watch this movie is to watch some of the biggest stars in Hollywood at the time in such an unusual film br br The one person who did a terrible job and did not even belong in this film was Madonna She did not belong in this movie and her acting job was pretty bad The movie at some points just stood still You expected something more and you got nothing Al Pacino plays a really bad dude and he does pretty good He and Beatty do make an excellent good guy and bad guy br br It is also interesting to see Dustin Hoffman and Warren Beatty in a film other than Isthar I did not see Ishtar but I heard bad things The thing about this movie is it is good but it could have been so much better I liked it as a child because I thought it looked cool and visually the movie is amazing the sets are incredible the writing is only fair and with such a cast in the movie I would expect a little better anyway br br SPOILER br br I especially thought the finale was not big enough It was interesting but for such a grand scale film I just thought it could have ended with a little more of a bang The reason to watch this movie is the atmosphere The movie only uses the 7 comic book colors making it all that more excellent visually anyway br br The costumes and makeup were flawless as well The facial makeup for the villains was great Beatty is just not up to such a bigger than life character Still this is a good movie that could have been much much more It is to me better than Batman the other comic book adaptation that came out close to the same time Of course that movie was much bigger in terms of gross
Dick Tracy was originally a comic book created in 1931 by Chester Gould He is a plainclothes detective who tracks down a crew of villains ranging from all types of visually original characters such as Flattop to The Blank to Big Boy Caprice These villains became so popular in the 40 s that Warner Bros created their own take on the Tracy style villains in such cartoons as Daffy Duck Tracy s comics were known for their liberal use of gunplay and the up to date technology advances notably the wristwatch communicator which got their fair share of screen time on this excellent movie The music was done wonderfully by Danny Elfman and the original songs by Madonna were interesting but they were not the high point for her career It s weird because as you watch the film and see the suspenseful moments the film feels so much like Batman because of Elfman s memorable sound to his pieces br br I love the tough talking kid Pacino s acting as Big Boy Caprice and that chin Madonna s take on villainy and the cinematography and directing were impeccable This film was very professionally made and features tons of great actors who were known as great actors for a while before this film was made Warren Beatty Al Pacino William Forsythe Dustin Hoffman Kathy Bates Mandy Patinkin Catherine O Hara Dick Van Dyke The film was directed by Beatty himself which was interesting It is almost like Beatty saw himself as Tracy in a past life or something because he really fit the part br br I had to give this film an 8 10 for everything that it brought to cinema that got overlooked for whatever reason There have been tons of misunderstandings over the rating of this movie on IMDb and I still don t understand why The characters were completely original and vibrant as was the style of the sets wardrobe lighting and everything in this film Go buy it today You will not be sorry
This movies is the best movie to watch for comic book feel The sets costumes and the color are just so vivid it is just like stepping into a comic book This is the movie I think of when the Mob is mentioned the suits the hats and the attitudes br br Hoffman gives comic relief as Mumbles and you can t help but feel sorry for Madonna as she tries and fails to win Tracy over This movie contains all the classic mob clich√©s burying people in concrete blowing up peoples cars tieing up the good guy and attempting to blow up his girlfriends house br br This movie is a classic in ever sense of the word even camera angels cry out comic book Its so great to be able to go back to an older movie and see that someone knew how a comic should be made into a movie after seeing such mistakes as Spawn and the Hulk br br YOU HAVE TO SEE THIS MOVIE
Love it or loathe it it s hard to not find Warren Beatty s take on Dick Tracy the 1990 film adaptation of Chester Gould s famous comic strip anything short of a genre classic Superhero films have been coming out of the woodwork in recent years and may soon become a genre all on its own br br Beatty s film liberally uses Gould s source material to full effect shooting in all six of the strip s primary colors and thus giving this unique yet familiar world of trigger happy mutant gangsters and loose seductive women a lush visual style and tone br br It can be stated that the film s strong visual aesthetics drastically short change the characters and their acting abilities which I don t think can be any further from the truth br br Dick Tracy relishes in its look and ghastly characters and Beatty himself who plays the dogged and incorruptible detective of the title is appropriately stoic and ready to bust the bad guys at any and all costs br br Other than the visual treats and Oscar winning makeup there is a plot and Big Boy Caprice Al Pacino deliciously over the top in an Oscar nominated performance seeks to eliminate Tracy in one well planned move but also seeks to gain control of all criminal action in the city by uniting all the feuding gangs under him br br Tracy meanwhile is juggling his relationship with Tess Trueheart Glenne Headly who as her name would have it remains faithfully by his side and cares for The Kid Charlie Korsmo who eventually finds a father figure to look up to in our crime busting hero Tracy s fidelity to Tess is tested by the tempting advances of Breathless Mahoney Madonna who is also Big Boy s main squeeze At the same time that all of this is going down things become heated when a new criminal figure arrives in town and decides to play both sides against the middle br br The performances are good as Beatty s focus on the strained and romantic relationships between each of the leads becomes the center of the material as opposed to just concentrating on pointless action and special effects Pacino freely chews up the scenery in a role that s truly standout from the rest br br Dick Tracy is one of the best and most overlooked of the comic book movie genre I think that if Chester Gould was still alive he would be proud of Warren Beatty s take on his beloved crime fighting detective br br 8 10
Usually when we use the word escapist we mean it negatively Warren Beatty s big screen version of Dick Tracy proves that escapist can be good This is truly one entertaining movie As the eponymous yellow clad fearless title character Beatty creates a detective to whom we can all relate ready for action but not without his weaknesses br br From there the rest of characters are almost a world unto themselves Tess Truehart Glenne Headly is as glamorous as one would expect the hubby of any crime fighter to be Breathless Mahoney Madonna is possibly the most perplexing person imaginable Big Boy Caprice Al Pacino is the average villain ruthless but cool Other characters include the speech challenged Mumbles Dustin Hoffman the over musical 88 Keys Mandy Patinkin and The Kid Charlie Korsmo Charles Durning James Caan Dick Van Dyke Estelle Parsons Catherine O Hara Seymour Cassel Paul Sorvino and Kathy Bates also star br br Oh wait a minute I haven t even explained the plot The plot involves Tracy trying and failing so far to find some way to nab Big Boy Simultaneously some very bizarre events have been going on in town the answers to which may or may not be closer than everyone thinks br br Of course the main thing about this movie is that it s fun to watch If Warren Beatty was having trouble acting his age then he made good use of that here Dick Tracy is one cool movie
At the time I am writing this I see out of over 15 000 votes it has a 5 8 rating Something is wrong with that picture Personally I give it a 10 I can see a 7 at the lowest or a possible 8 if it was rated by people that see this movie for what it truly is It is a movie based on a comic book hero This movie won more than it s share of awards Won 3 Oscars Another 5 wins 26 nominations right there tells me it s better than a 5 8 Some great acting from some very good actors some great special effects and in my opinion will be if not already a classic for years to come If you re looking for pure entertainment be sure to check out Dick Tracy Definitely a movie you can watch more than a few times Al Pacino is great as Big Boy Caprice
That was great fun I never read those Chester Gould comics but it s not necessary to know them Maybe there were some inside jokes I didn t figure out but what the eye doesn t see the heart cannot grieve over This is such an ironic colourful film and the actors are good humoured all together The setting is similar to that in the Batman movies but not as dark and grey Okay the story is not so original but there is a plot which is not self evident and a more or less surprising ending br br With this movie you could play an interesting game if you watch it with friends Don t watch the credits at the beginning and then look who s the fastest to find out who are the famous actors under their make up
I saw Dick Tracy when I was very young I didn t know who any of the actors were and I didn t know the movie would turn out different than the way it was previewed I sure loved it though br br Warren Beatty stars as the crime fighting 1930 s detective Dick Tracy who goes after the biggest mob bosses in the city This time Big Boy Caprice Al Pacino has killed a very powerful man and is out to take over the city with his singer girlfriend Breathless Mahoney Madonna who has her eye on Tracy It becomes even worse because a new criminal is invading and the worst part is this criminal has no face He or she is very unknown Plus the famous villians are back from the comic book collection br br I thought that this movie was very colorful and creative It was entertaining and fun to watch especially as a child Warren Beaty was just like James Bond of the 1930 s the way he played Dick Tracy br br An ensemble cast of the film includes Charlie Korsmo Glenn Headly William Forsythe Dustin Hoffman James Caan Ed O Ross Tommy Lee Jones Mandy Patinkin Charles Durning Plus More br br Dick Tracy is a movie for all ages and is a fun movie for a family to enjoy Take my word for it
Most successful comic book movies usually depend on having villains that are bigger than life ready to jump off the screen and strangle you alive with a smile or a demented line or two of dialog The Tim Burton Batmans had it as did in an even more grotesque manner Sin City With Dick Tracy producer director star Warren Beatty piles on the villains until it becomes part of the framework Like a boisterous homage to 1930s gangster pictures only this time meant for kids as opposed to the darker Bonnie and Clyde Dick Tracy is filled joyfully with archetypes and bright primary colors where the criminals carry tommy guns and are formed on their faces to shape their personalities Villains like The Stooge Shoulders Lips The Brow Mumbles the Blank Pruneface Spud Chester Gould gave the names to his characters that fit their profiles and gave his hero a jaw that could cut glass The film is a continuation of sight gags that are perfectly taken seriously br br If at the time movies like Batman and underrated Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were darker depictions of reality within a comic book outline Dick Tracy is more old school It s a story of cops and crooks or rather A cop detective Tracy as he tries to bust Big Boy Al Pacino in what is arguably his BIGGEST performance to date and in a sense the one that makes sense for his grandiose style but with no such luck There s also a little kid called simply the Kid Charlie Korsmo who somehow brings more spunk to this little kid than would ve been imagined and Tracy s love interest in Tess And then there s the nightclub dame Madonna who probably doesn t give any kind of great acting performance but maybe that suits the role fine and she sings excellently when called upon who wont testify unless Tracy admits feelings he doesn t have for her Then there s convoluted dealings with taking Tracy down and a mysterious masked figure with a scraggly voice br br Meantime as if doing an impersonation of a Howard Hawks film in a splash of visual effects and bigger explosions Dick Tracy adds on the wink and nod comedy and the action like its syrup on a tall stack of pancakes It s a wonder to look at this world which is created in ways that have a fascination to them that had they been done today would just be simply by proxy of computers i e Sin City which can be justifiably compared to Beatty s film We re driven through this world in great big shots and then thrust in the plot line or whatever there is of it in big editing montages with camera angles that seem to come out of those little tilted panels in the comics of old I m almost reminded of the Cotton Club during these sequences as story music detail and a few BIG punches and gun shots go a long way to revealing what needs to be said which actually isn t more than it needs to And there s a heap load of catchy dialog from the script one of my favorites the enemy of my enemy is my enemy plus any of Pacino s references to other figures in quotes br br Revisiting this after seeing it for the first time in the movie theater and only remembering little bits Dick Tracy is a hard boiled fantasy to the finest degree It s filled with good cheer for the kids and with some pretty good action squared away without some of the more sinister intent of its cousin comic book movies i e PG 13 fare and for the adults its throw back central done with panache and a solid feeling for the unsubtle Even Dustin Hoffman hams it up and he barely says an audible word
Just picked this up on DVD and watched it again I love the bright colors vs dark imagery Not a big Beatty fan but this is an excellent popcorn movie Pacino is astounding as always and well this movie marked the period where Madonna was her absolute sexiest I wish she had stuck with the Breathless look for a while longer Charlie Korsmo s first really big role other than What about bob The makeup effects were cutting edge then and still hold up for the most part Beautiful scenery and mood transport you directly into a comic strip environment The cars wardrobe buildings and even the streetlights et a great tone not to mention the perfect lighting although the scenes with a lot of red can get a tad annoying as it tends to blur a little Just wish Beatty had gotten the chance to make a sequel All in all a fun few hours
Heh if I tell you to compare The Dark Knight with some 18 years old comics adapted movie rated 5 9 will you call me crazy That s just to catch your attention Everyday I meet people complaining there are no good movies who seem to only know the recent blockbusters It s never a bad thing to search and explore old movies especially those with good artistic values Dick Tracy is one of those can t be easily outdated in terms of technology br br The negative reviews mainly complained about DT s messed up story But it appears to me that the storyline is quite clear and I had no problem following it I didn t see the comic books yet I am not a huge US comic fan but I appreciate the top notch film making and performances Maybe the expectations of most people were too high about the story it would tell But if you see a movie casting Madonna and Warren Beatty together what would you expect I had some scratches on my head and can t help but wonder did we really see the same movie The title role although not as competent as it sounds still was able to pull him up and charm the audiences Madonna was more express less than breathless in her seductive role but added a lot of fun to the story Al Pacino was funny and prodigy to himself Apparently he s bold enough to go sarcastic on his previously successful roles We can see a hybrid of Scarface Michael Corleone Adolf Hitler and Robert De Niro punching our stomaches to make us laugh And many thanks to make ups br br To me it s not bad at all The surreal feeling really got me
The opening credits make for a brilliant atmospheric piece of escapist entertainment that s full of little nods to the comic strip All the good guys are good all the bad guys are bad and the film is jam packed with familiar character actors covered in gruesom make up to hi lite their characteristics br br Warren Beatty as Dick Tracy is the ultimate tough guy straight man incorruptable calm usually always a better fighter than the other guy and rarely one to push the limit on legality Al Pacino as Big Boy Caprice steals every scene he s in as a hunch backed gangster in some unnamed metropolis of 1930s gangsters Maddonna plays the kind of person she d probably play best Breathless Mahoney a nightclub singer and femme fatale with her own little agenda going Gleanne Headly is Tracy s tough talking fiercely independent long time girlfrined And then there s The Kid a funny little street urchin Tracy takes in who models himself after his surrogate father and saves Tracy when the detective has accepted his fate of being blown up br br The supporting players are a Who s Who of character actors Charles Durning is the chief of police Dick Van Dyke is the District Attorney who s bribed by Big Boy s goons to keep him on the streets Dustin Hoffman has a humorous turn as Mumbles the snitch whose dialect is so indecipherable the cops can t make head nor tail of what he has to say R G Armstrong is Pruneface one of the rival gangsters Big Boy forms a special allegiance to in order to create a network of crime spreading throughout the whole city Mandy Patinkin is 88 Keys the piano player for Breathless s show Paul Sorvino plays Lips Manlis Breathless s former benefactor until Big Boy gives him the Bath James Caan wears relatively little make up in his performance as the only gangster who won t go along with Big Boy s grand plan William Forsythe and Ed O Ross are Big Boy s enforcers Flattop and Itchy br br This movie retains all of the corn of the comic strip plus it is full of vibrant colors Almost all the suits are elaborate in blues and greens and yellows and reds All the colors of the rainbow are found in this movie and then some The matte paintings that are used truly realize this world as two dimensional only acted in three dimensional sets The humor is plentiful Al Pacino fills the shoes of his character like no other character he s played before or since Big Boy is kind of crazy and kind of self pitying He s an eccentric little man who takes pride in quoting our Founding Fathers and likening himself to great political leaders The man with the plan always looking for the smartest way to do business
Dick Tracy is one of my all time favorite films I must admit to those that haven t seen it You will either really love it or really hate it It came out a year after the success of Batman So everyone s expectations were so high that many were let down simply because the plot is so simple But its based on a comic strip what did you expect Creatively this movie is amazing The sets make up music costumes and the impressive acting make this film fantastic The film has bloodless violence and no bad language that s something rare these days Directed produced and stars Warren Beatty as the ace crime fighter going up against Al Pacino s evil Big Boy Caprice and his mob of thugs Madonna steals the show as the seductive Breathless Mahoney This is one of the best characters Madonna has ever played She has the best one liners I ve heard Madonna fans would love it One of the coolest things about the film is that they only used seven colors to make it look like a comic strip This film is truly a piece of artwork that is sadly overlooked by the public To sum things up this film brings out the child in all of us It s a film that will leave you smiling at the end
I thoroughly enjoyed this true to form take on the Dick Tracy persona This is a well done product that used modern technology to craft a imagery filled comic era story If you are a fan of or recently watched some of the old Dick Tracy b w movies then you re sure to get a kick out of this rendition The pastel colors and larger than life characters rendered in a painstakingly authentic take on an era gone by is entertainment as it s meant to be I personally find Madonna s musical element to be a major part of this film the CD featuring her music from this movie is one I ve listened to often over the years it s just so well done and performed musically and tuned to that era In my mind Madonna s finest moment both on screen but especially musically This is sure to bring out the kid in you
Dick Tracy is easily the best comic book based movie made to date The movie has the same feel as the comic book staying true to the color scheme The Batman series has climbed fallen climbed and fallen again Dick Tracy has true staying power as something that both adults and children can enjoy The good guys triumph over evil without blood and gore to get the point across Al Pacino does a wonderful job of his own adaptation of Big Boy Caprice and Madonna is memorable as Breathless But the best job by far is Warren Beatty who just epitomizes Dick Tracy just as he did with Clyde Barrows I can t wait until it comes out on DVD on April 2 2002 my tape is wearing thin
Don t look for an overdeveloped plotline here just sit back with some popcorn and enjoy this one A gallery of stars pop up as the classic cartoon character s villains in this live action comedy which features incredible makeup and set design not to mention knockout performances from Beatty Madonna and Pacino Great fun for kids and adults alike br br out of
I never attended the midnight showing of a movie before Dick Tracy came out br br I still have the t shirt ticket I had to wear to get admitted to the showing around here somewhere and like that shirt Dick Tracy has stuck with me ever since br br If you ve seen the movie the sharp visuals bright primary colors and strong characters have no doubt been etched into your brain It s a wonder to behold br br As director star co writer producer Beatty knows what works in a film and shows it here taking a familiar American icon and re creating him for a whole new era Still set in the 30s Tracy has a kind of timeless quality like all good films do I ve lost track of how many times I ve watched Tracy and I still catch something new every time I do br br The others are all top notch starting with Pacino s Big Boy Caprice a reminder that he can do comedy with the best of them even Madonna s Breathless Mahoney is a relevation in that under the right environment she can act GASP br br But there s still such themes touched on as the necessity of family keeping true to one s self good versus evil even Machiavellian themes are explored Odd for a comic strip film but hey it works br br All in all Dick Tracy is a classic unto itself Compared with other films of this decade it makes a strong statement It s a good strong film that doesn t depend on blood violence profanity or nudity to make its point br br There s a lesson to be learned here br br Ten stars Great Scott
If Dick Tracy was in black and white the pope wouldn t be religious Giving a new sense to the concept of color in a movie we are offered an unique experience throughout a comic strip world and it s one of the few movies which succeeded in doing so thanks to a serious script good direction great performances Al Pacino is astonishing and most importantly a powerful mix of cinematography art direction and costume design Using only primary colors the experience is quite different from anything we have seen before And there is also a quite successful hommage to all the gangster movie genre pratically extinct from modern cinema Overall I see this movie as a fresh attempt and a touch of originality to a cinema which relies more and more on the old and already seen formulas 7 out of 10
Dick Tracy is one of our family s favorites the actors are great the art direction is exceptional the music is magic It s not supposed to be To Kill A Mockingbird it s a fun experience br br Stephen Sondhemim s songs are stellar Back in Business is energetic Sooner or Later is just right What Can You Lose is haunting even tunes like Live Alone and Like It add to the story br br Got to love the giddily over the top performances of Al Pacino Dustin Hoffman Glenn Headly Charlie Korsmo Mandy Patinkin James Caan Dick Van Dyke supporting villains The list is far too long And yes even Madonna and Warren Beatty are awesome Written with a smile a minute how many times have we looked at each other and said Wait a minute I m having a thought it s gone br br However one of most telling things about in this film is that everyone involved seems to be having a good time and that above all adds to the enjoyment for the viewer So if you haven t already why not give Dick Tracy a chance accept it for what it is a Sunday comic strip brought to life and in a wonderful way
I ve been watching Dick Tracy for years and as a result it s become a vital part of my life it was with me throughout childhood and I used to see it quite often Seeing it now as an adult it s still a very good movie dark satiric and incredibly misunderstood About the only thing that can be said is the Oscar nomination Pacino received other than that it is rarely discussed and didn t make much of a fuss when it came out br br Pacino is over the top but to good effect as he s clearly having loads of fun Beatty is great as Dick Tracy and behind the camera manages to capture the atmosphere of a film noir comic book better than any other film possibly I have ever seen Just taking a look at one scene from the film is breathtaking The lighting velvet overtones and smog smoke combine to create a great effect br br There are some really funny cameos including one by Dustin Hoffman as Mumbles and I don t think there are any flaws at all in terms of acting even the mandatory kid character is far better than expected br br Overall a really fine movie that has become misunderstood over the years since its release and is incredibly underrated with only 5 7 10 average on IMDb The critics reviews are very positive check out RottenTomatoes com and after seeing the film once again it s not hard to see why this is a perfect example of capturing the essence of a comic book from style to eccentricity br br Highly recommended 4 5 5 stars
This is amazing looking movie with the whole thing done in just six or seven colors When it came out over 15 years ago it stunned audiences with its color scheme being so different from anything else that had ever been put on film Those colors for me at least make this an absolutely fascinating film to watch There are literally thousands of scenes I wish could freeze and somehow convert them to a painting to study for their artwork br br The characters and the story don t match up to the greatness of the photography but they are all over the top especially the villains The famous actors who played them here must have a had a lot of fun on the set playing Flatop Pruneface Lips Mumbles etc br br Meanwhile Warren Beatty and Gleanne Hedley are good as Dick Tracey and girlfriend Tess Truehart and she s as sweet and soft as her name Another good addition is Charlie Korsmo as the delinquent young boy Dick and Tess take under their wing The colorful other characters are played by Al Pacino Dustin Hoffman William Forysthe Paul Sorvino Mandy Patinkin Madona and other names you know but are too numerous to list here Check the full credits on the main page and you ll amazed br br The only negatives I found were Pacino s voice which grates on you after awhile Madonna s off key singing voice and the fact that the film would have been better trimmed about 10 minutes Those faults are all minor because overall this is a fun movie a cartoon strip coming to life in an incredibly colorful fashion like nothing you have ever seen
Despite gorgeous and breathtaking animation this is probably one of most uninspiring Disney films I ve seen and I don t slam Disney films very often Spirit is a wild stallion who repeatedly gets captured either by the cavalry or by Indians both of which try to break him Spirit ends up forming a bond with the Indian and that in a nutshell is the story With exception to the beautiful animation of the horses neither I or my five year old were very inspired or excited by this film It s ironic that it s titled Spirit as spirit is what this film could have used a bit more of An extra point was given for the soundtrack which was enjoyable with songs by Bryan Adams and Hans Zimmer And although this film is rated G you will still probably have to end up explaining what breaking a horse means to your five year old I did br br
Time for a rant eh I thought Spirit was a great movie to watch However there were a few things that stop me from rating it higher than a 6 or 7 I m being a little bit generous with the 7 br br Point 1 Matt Damon aggravates me I was thinking what a dicky voice they got for the main character when I first heard him narrate and then I realized it is Matt Damon The man bugs me so very bad his performance in The Departed was terrible and ruined the movie for me before the movie got a chance to ruin itself but that s another story for some other time as it almost did Spirit I was able to get past this fact because of how little narration there actually was thankfully br br Point 2 Brian Adams sucks The whole score was terrible The songs were unoriginal generic and poorly executed not once did I find the music to fit and the lyrics were terrible Every time one of the lame songs came on I was turned off I almost thought I d start hearing some patriotic propaganda slipped into the super American freedom style lyrics I couldn t help but be reminded of those terrible patriotic songs that played on the radio constantly after 9 11 In light of the native American aspects of the film they should have gone with fitting music using right instruments not petty radio hit teen bop 14 year old girl crap I thought I was back in junior high school I can t believe no better could have been done I refuse to Had it not have been for this I d rank the film up more with Disney which knows a thing or two about originality ok don t bother saying what I know some of you are probably thinking Too bad it s a shame they couldn t have hired better musicians br br I liked the art and animation except for some things here and there like sometimes the angles appear too sharp on the face and the lines too thick or dark on the body thick dark lines mainly near the end There were often times when I thought they _tried too hard_ on the emotion and facial expressions and failed at drawing any real emotion But there were also times when the emotion ran thick Anyhow many scenes were lazy and the layers were apparent br br OK I m falling asleep here so I ll sum it up before I start making less sense br br Nice try on an epic film it turned out mediocre though Matt Damon you suck
White man progress industrialization BAD First nations nature animals GOOD Simple formula Actually in past days the same kind of propaganda was used to defend the status quo now it is used to attack it However that being said I think the movie does succeed in overcoming hackneyed politicization because it plays to the themes of freedom and original nature in a way that appeals to everyone You may not be onside with the movie s rubbishy revisionism of how the West was won er lost But anyone can feel a sense of longing for the days when horses could run free on the Western plains The movie also conveniently sidesteps the fact that there were no horses in America before the evil white man brought them there Anyway I liked it The quality of the animation especially the opening shot is incredible
I love horses and admire hand drawn animation so I expected nothing short of amazement from Dreamworks new animated picture Spirit Stallion of the Cimarron I guess you could say I was a little bit disappointed You have wonderful animation and at first what seems like a perfect story A story about absolutely nothing but a horse in nature The animals don t sing cute songs or even talk a major plus Sadly the film has an uncalled for narration by Matt Damon a sappy soundtrack by Bryan Adams and enough action scenes to compare it to a Jerry Bruckheimer production If the film makers would have just stayed with simplicity we d have a masterpiece here This is not a great film but it is good entertainment for small children I would recommend this film to families because it has its heart in the right place and its the only thing out there right now that isn t offensive to small children Not bad but could have been much better Very pretty visuals though
While I had wanted to se this film since the first time I watched the trailer I was in for a deep surprise with this film While some of the elements and actions of the characters seemed a little too cartoonish the dark nature of the film really makes this a much different experience Instead of the feel good happy story this film takes you in another direction that proves to be uplifting but also disturbing Most kids won t understand some of the darker moments in the film which makes this film rather watchable for adults I was also impressed with the cinematography using animation and digital animation to create a seamless network of pans and tilts The musical score was once again solid proving Hans Zimmer is the go to guy when it comes to animated scores and I never thought I would say I actually enjoyed Brian Adams music
This animated movie is a masterpiece The narration music animation and storyline where all remarkable My girlfriend and I saw it again for a second time and we got more insight from it We invited a couple friends to see Spirit with us and they really enjoyed it a lot When I asked them to come along to see it they thought it was a movie about horses but afterwards they realized it was more than that I liked Esperanza Spirit Rain and Lil Creek who reminds me of Nathan Chasing Horse who is Smiles A Lot in Dances With Wolves Spirit has deep symbolic meanings and metaphors that I found to be empowering and inspirational br br I saw Spirit for a third time and I want to go see it again I enjoyed Spirit tremendously because its portrayal of American Indians is realistic dignified and non stereotypical unlike the movie The Road to El Dorado which was a total farce because it portrayed American Indians in a disrespectful and stereotypical way But Dreamworks has redeemed themselves by making Spirit a great movie that I found to be acceptable I hope they continue to make more animated movies like Spirit and I would like to see sequels or spinoffs to Spirit if its done respectfully and without stereotyping American Indians br br I highly recommend this to others who have an open mind to go and pay to see Spirit Stallion of the Cimarron
This is a wonderful movie in a lot of ways Everyone in my family enjoyed it The animation is excellent and easily demonstrates that there are plenty of producers who create films that are as visually brilliant as anything that comes from the Disney Studio br br One difference from the normal Disney fare is that this Dreamworks movie does not feature some wise cracking side kick for comedy relief And there are no sudden moments where the characters break into song I am sure that a scene at the beginning of the film would not appear in a Disney picture the birth of Spirit But it is done tastefully and is not offensive at all Spirit was a great breath of fresh air Don t get me wrong I have loved Disney for years and will continue to do so br br Spirit is another example of great animated fare As soon as it was over my kids wanted to watch it again I had the same feeling I thoroughly recommend it
This is one of the most calming relaxing and beautifully made animation films I ve ever seen With beautiful music throughout the movie the sounds and music can make you feel like you re in the movie This movie is not just great for kids but adults too It teaches you lessons such as never forget who you are you can do whatever you stick your mind to and to brave and daring This movie can make you cry at times too which is always a nice touch in movies This movie is funny sad cute and keeps you on the edge of your seat Some movies really give you a fuzzy feeling after you see them and the movie Spirit is definitely one of them With my vote of 9 10 stars for animation music and a wonderful idea for a movie it gave me a whole lot of Spirit
This movie was highly entertaining The soundtrack Bian Adams is simply beautiful and inspiring Even more impressive is Brian Adams doing all the songs in French as well The score is also uplifting and dramatic br br The movie is made from a mix of traditional animation combined with computer generated images The result is truly stunning I watch this film at least once a week with my kids and we never tire of it The story is compelling and well narrated br br I don t understand anyone who would rank this movie less than a 7 Definately a keeper in my household
I recently watched Spirit and enjoyed it very much I ve seen it about 4 times now on HBO and will buy the DVD Those who gave negative reviews would probably think that Vanishing Point was just another car chase movie and Thelma Louise was just another chick flick Although the conclusions of those films are darker I feel the themes are somewhat related that freedom and individualism are very important and that there is usually someone wanting to take it away from you The other common trait of these movies is the caring thoughtful guardian angel types who help the main characters to overcome adversity br br Another review here mentions how this film relates to the theme of civilization invading someone else s home All one has to do is look around at the dwindling open areas around us to see that br br I thought the animation and the story were amazing the animators really got the horses to look act and move naturally Spirit s emotions were very clear as the story progressed yes I m aware they do humanize the horses a bit but this is fiction In a couple of action scenes you feel caught in the current of the rapids and the heat from a forest fire In other more quiet scenes which are most of the time you re allowed to savor the backgrounds One of the big things that make the story really work is by not going the talking singing animals route Doing so would take away from the story s power Instead the flow of the story is told by occasional narration by the main character further punch is added by the fantastic soundtrack Another plus is that they weren t afraid to give the story somewhat of a dark side which really made this film watchable to me This isn t prevalent through the entire movie though and the conclusion is fitting and uplifting without being sappy br br Those who appreciate horses will really like this movie but I think it s a bit more than a horse movie I don t feel this would be a good movie to take children to if they re brought up on the inane fare that s offered up today But if they re the thoughtful sort that can handle compelling stories like The Lord of the Rings and Black Beauty they ll likely love this movie Hell I m 35 years old and STILL love that stuff
This was a great movie with a good story My children 10 7 5 and 4 all loved this movie including myself The music was also fantastic No the horses do not talk but instead the story is told by Spirit And to hear a story told by a horse s point if view was fun br br I think the title says it all spirit This movie really gives you a sense of family and home and friends I would have to say my 4 year old boy and 5 year old girl were really touched by this movie and even got so into it they laughed so hard and they cheered for spirit in the end br br Enjoy Spirit with your family and have your spirit lifted with this heartwarming story Your kids will love it I think you will too
I thought this movie would be dumb but I really liked it People I know hate it because Spirit was the only horse that talked Well so what The songs were good and the horses didn t need to talk to seem human I wouldn t care to own the movie and I would love to see it again 8 10
Spirit Stallion of the Cimarron is an overall wonderful movie The blending of animation types is unique the storyline is amazing and the music is wonderful br br The drawn animation is a special thing about many animations How they expressed the characters especially the horses through their animation are spectacular especially While the way horses communicate through body language is easy to understand many young children and people who haven t studied horses might not understand Without words I would imagine it would have to be challenging to express them through the features Because of this I understand the eyebrow they added to the horses while real horses don t have those thick lines One of the few things I noticed about horse habits that might have been portrayed strangely is that Spirit lead his mother s herd In wild horse herds the lead stallion usually chases the young colts out br br Also while some people might think portraying the white army officers as the bad guys is stereotyping think of all the movies in which the Native Americans have been portrayed as that Sometimes back then they did treat mustangs very poorly For example in real history the Appaloosa breed was almost wiped out due to the Army officers Imagine what would have happened to one of the worlds best loved riding breeds if the Native Americans had not saved them br br I think it s amazing how the realism wasn t subtracted by making the horses talk to each other Spirit s feelings were expressed by a little bit of narration but mostly through the music by Bryan Adams The songs express the story really well and Hans Zimmer and Bryan Adams did a great job telling the story through melodies and lyrics br br The emotion I got when watching the movie whether the first time or the twentieth yes I ve watched it that much you wouldn t believe Some of the scenes take your breath away while others seem to force tears into your eyes The opening sequence showing Spirit s homeland puts you right into the spectacular action right away br br I don t understand at all why some people are so hateful of this brilliant movie Overall I rate it a 10 10 a must watch
I began riding horses fairly recently and as anyone who has ever ridden should know I fell in love with horses and their world I rented Spirit on a whim just trying to pack my life full of as much horse related material as I could and I was surprised by the results br br What I expected was a feel good Disneyesque movie with talking animals and stereotypes every five minutes br br What I got was an amazing film filled with beautiful scenery and animation and an amazing storyline that has the great potential to warm one s heart br br Spirit is a wild mustang in the Old West whose entire world is brought crumbling down around him when he discovers the humans slowly taking over his homeland The story unfolds with a wide array of characters some human some animals all are well written and most are pleasant to watch on screen br br I would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good story and who has an appreciation for history and animals br br One thing I forgot to mention but that I feel is important is that the animals in this film do not talk This was a really nice vacation from the Lady And The Tramp animated movies that everyone today is used to
I really dislike both Shrek films Since their both PG and have words in them I would never say myself so I disliked them br br But when it comes to Spirit Stallion of the Cimarron which I just barely watched for the first time last month I became a fan of animated films other than Pixar Spoilers ahead In Spirit Stallion of the Cimarron a horse foal is born and eventually becomes the leader of his heard One night he sees a strange light in the distance and he sets off toward it This action eventually leads to his capture and several more things Throughout the movie we hear a narration It s through the thoughts of Spirit though the horses never talk This is what makes the movie so goo They the movie makers recored real horses to do the sounds the horses made none of those sounds were made by humans br br Spirit meets Rain a beautiful mare and Little Creek a native American who owns Rain Little Creek later frees Spirit and Rain they go running home br br I have never been a big fan of Brian Adams but I intend to buy the soundtrack to this film in the near future br br Watch this film and you won t regret it My Score 10 10
I liked this movie a lot The animation was well done and the romance was cute I liked most of Bryan Adams songs and the Hans Zimmer score was excellent What a lot of people don t realize is how well it relates to the Heart of Darkness Apocalypse Now themes what happens when so called civilization invades someone elses home what does it mean to be civilized etc The opening scenery and music were very stirring The film is a lament to an America that was once beautiful
The horse is indeed a fine animal Picturesque depictions of wild horses and their grace could never have been more majestic in an animation flick br br The animation is simply stupendous The fine animation forms the backbone of the beauty that the horses embolden across the flick More so when the stallion traverses diverse terrain jumps across cliffs and braves waters br br Soundtrack too is very impressive The wonderful instrumental music lures you to appreciate the movie br br They say the story of the west was written from the saddle of a horse huh Well The story of a fine horse sure was written from the saddle of the west br br All in all this movie is clearly up there with the best It is one of the best animation flicks i have watched Would be a very fine choice on a lonely night An easy 9 10
Well what can I say this movie really got to me it s not so bad as many say I really loved it although the idea seems so simple and rather boring it isn t First of all I enjoyed the soundtrack Bryan Adams it really goes with the movie Second the simple story and the drama of Spirit gets your attention One thing I like the most is that they didn t give the stallion a human voice to interact with the other horses it makes the movie more realistic not many animations seem realistic now do they but I don t know making animals talk is just so lame br br One of the most beautiful animations of 2002 in my opinion I recommend it to everyone not just the kids because it is very relaxing
If only ALL animation was this great This film is classic because it is strong is two simple aspects Story and Character The characters in this film are beautifully personified I felt for all of the characters and human animal relationship in the movie works perfectly The beautiful animation and 3 D computer animation hasn t worked better in any other film This is a great movie for kids and for adults who want a classic hero s journey 8 of 10
I have probably seen this movie over fifty times by now because of the kids they just cant get enough of Spirit The best thing about the movie I think is that the animals isn t able to talk this makes the whole movie more honest and makes a better impression on both kids and the adults so 10 10 from the kids and me
In a time when Hollywood is making money by showing our weaknesses despair crime drugs and war along comes this film which reminds us the concept of the Indomitable Spirit If you are feeling beaten down this movie will free your mind and set you soaring We all know how tough life can be sometime we need to be reminded that persistence and courage will get us through That s what this film did for me and I hope it will for you
Spirit is a unique and original look at western life from the point of view of a wild horse and native Americans The film focuses on the friendships and perils that a wild horse Spirit encounters during his life br br Very well done in the presentation using the technology available today to deliver stunning visuals that are breathtaking in their depth and realism br br The music is fantastic with songs by Bryan Adams and music by Hans Zimmer who also was responsible for the extremely popular music from the 1994 Disney hit The Lion King br br The story is not very deep but the fact that it isn t quite as in depth as some movies doesn t in my opinion detract from the film as a whole br br An excellent film which I enjoyed immensely and that is suitable for all the family Not one to be missed 10 10
Life Pod is one of those movies that you just watch and try not to analyze too hard The acting is rather amateurish at best The special effects are obviously low budget but not too bad The story line is rather stock but with an interesting twist Computer run amok but not exactly a computer and the running amok is very understandable when the truth is revealed Still the movie has its moments and is quite watchable For me at least part of the allure of this movie is the prominent role of Kristine DeBell She may not be the greatest actress in the world but having been a former playmate of the month she is cute enough In all Life Pod is much like other low budget Sci Fi movies of the 1980s and somewhat predictable br br The White Star Lines bit is cute if completely inaccurate The last of the White Star Lines Company stock was purchased by the Cunard Lines 1947 and the last ship to sail under the White Star colors was the Britannic not the sister of Titanic which was sold for scrap in 1960
I agree with Jerry It s a very underrated space movie of course how many good low budget ones AREN T underrated If I remember correctly the solution to the mystery was a sort of variation but not rip off of 2001 because the computer controlling the spaceship had actually been a man who had somehow been turned into a computer And like HAL they tried to disconnect his mind but not the mechanical parts of him and as with HAL it led to disaster There is at least one funny moment When the Christopher Cary character who can t find any food finds the abandoned pet bird there s a kind of ominous moment but then the obvious thing doesn t happen after all
Wow Something of a surprise Though flawed it is far better that I expected br br The brand new space liner Arcturus with some 3 000 passengers is in the final days of its sixteen day trip to Jupiter Without warning the ship s Cerebral central computer sounds a disaster alarm and orders everyone to evacuate br br Soon there are only a handful of people remaining including one of the ship s astrogators Penny the captain Cary and the director of the shipping line Kenyon br br It turns out that the alarm was false and that the main Cerebral is acting br br erratically The remaining passengers and crew must escape the ship and br br avoid personal conflicts in order to survive br br The film starts out very well The opening commercial is a very nice touch There are obvious parallels to 2001 A Space Odyssey and to the historic br br sinking of the Titanic The film does slow down at times and has pacing br br problems but is generally well made and well acted
This movie can be described in those 2 words just unbelievable This is the best movie ever made I just cant see why this movie isnt in the top 250 I also can t see why anybody would not love Scarface Anyways if you havnt seen it it is a must buy
A lot of people are saying that Al Pacino over acted but I mean common obviously for a movie role like this a cuban drug lord you need a bit of over acting in this role with that cuban accent This movie overall was a really good movie I myself rated a 10 10 I would highly recommend people to watch this movie
this movie is just great if you have a chance to see it then you should run to see it even though the movie has almost nothing to do with its original from 1932 Pacino does a great job playing as Tony Montana to get around br br Pacino has this way about him where he can say anything in anyway and make it sound just great if you thought that Pulp Fiction was good with the swear words if you saw it then you should also see Scarface to see another angle at how an actor can say them its quite sweet br br even though the movie is has a lot of action and the plot moves very fast through time not keeping the realtime aspect ratio correct it is still easy to follow along but you must keep your eyes peeled at all times to not lose anything personally i have found that watching this movie makes three hours seem like a breeze it is really just that great br br this movie is one of thoe movies that is acted and directed so well that not only do you forget that this movie was made in the crappy 80s but that it makes you actually root for the bad guy So say good night to the BAD guy
On MTV cribs all the ballers and shot callers pull the classic movie Scarface out of their DVD collection This may give you an idea that Scarface is a gangster movie Sure there are gangsters and mobs in it but that s not the point of Scarface Tony Montana Al Pacino is just a cuban refuge looking for a new way of life He falls in with the mob group and becomes a well known drug lord Montana was all for doing what you wanted to do with your life The classic phrase Say hello to my little friend is in Scarface This quote is what always comes to mind when I think about Brian DePalmas movie Scarface This falls under my top 10 favorite movies I would rate it 1 2 out of Definitely a movie you must see PHENOMENAL
This movie has it all It is a classic depiction of the events that surrounded the migration of thousands of Cuban refugees Antonio Montana played by Al Pacino is just one of the thousands to get a chance to choose his destiny in America This cinematic yet extremely accurate depiction of Miamis Drug Empire is astonishing Brian DePalma does an amazing job directing this picture so much that the viewer becomes involved with both the storyline as well as every character in the cast With Tony s characters pressence being so believable and strong Brian DePalma brang out the raw talent exposed by Steven Bauer Manny Tony s best Friend Mary Elizabeth Mastantonio Gina Tony s Sister Robert Loggia Frank Tony s Boss and Michelle Pfeiffer Elvira Frank s Wife I enjoyed every minute watching this movie and still watch it on a weekly basis On this year the 20th Anniversary of this classic crime movie I for one am a true believer that in another 20 years people will still refer to this movie in astonishing numbers With other crime movies being so dramatic I find this movie is a shock to the system
This movie is very entertaining and is never ever boring even running at nearly 3 hours Al Pacino Michelle Phieffer and the rest of the cast are great in the film and are very believable The violence was a little extreme in the film but then it showed how vicious the drug trade was at the time of the film The ending is amazing and is probalby one of the coolest scenes ever Great movie and you will probably really enjoy it
for whoever play games video games here did anybody notice that the GTA Vice City Mansion inside the game and some other things including weapons from the movie that are connected to this movie and this movie inspired the makers of the game Rockstar Games to copy some things from this movie and by the way this is one of the best 80 s movies out there i recommend this for anybody who still didn t see it 10 10 no questions asked
Perhaps this could be the best movie ever made and if it s not it s certainly one of those who are burned onto your pupils as what Brian De Palma delivers here is a great piece of cinematographic artwork First there is the director s touch of Brian De Palma who proves once again he might be one of the best directors ever there is the superb performance from Al Pacino who is delivering an immortal hero on the big screen Tony Montana there are the many different violent scenes that you will never forget the one with the chainsaw the one in where Tony is sitting in a bath which is as big as most people s living rooms there are the many superb one liners count how many times the word f ck is used there are the superb little details the Pan American globe that screams The world is yours or the great discomusic from Giorgio Moroder Nothing can be named that isn t sublime here and it easily is along with The Godfather Good fellas and White heat one of the best gangstermovies ever made
One of the most definitive gangster films of the 80 s Scarface is very much a film of its time The first thing you notice when you watch this film is that it is screaming at you made in 1983 The costumes the music score and soundtrack the hairstyles make no mistake about it this is a film all about crime in the 80 s and while it should have dated horribly it hasn t This is still a superb film While Georgio Moroder s music has dated a fair bit it still compliments the story of Tony Montana well thanks to the superb screenplay by Oliver Stone and the first class direction of Brian De Palma one of two films that he has made with Pacino the other being the fantastic Carlito s Way All of De Palma s trademarks are here the strong language the graphic violence more on that later the stylish excesses such as grandiose set pieces and of course the stylish camera work br br Pacino dominates the film and I mean that literally He is the dominant star of this film His performance over the top this is one of those films were Pacino doesn t so much say his lines as he does shouts them this time with a superb Cuban accent However this is Pacino and he does it fantastically Only he could go this far over the top and still come away from the film with his acting integrity in tact While some may complain about his shouting of his lines and the sheer excess of it all this is an excessive film Take a look at the production design of Tony s house take a look at the violence in this film The chainsaw incident is downright brutal and their is blood everywhere The shoot out at the end has bodies going down at a rate that is more akin to Schwarzenegger and Stallone in the Rambo films Take a look at the amount of coke that is displayed in the film so Pacino s performance I suppose is perfect for the film He is supported by actors who are more akin to saying their lines in a more controlled way Steven Bauer in particularly as Manny Tony s best friend is the stand out of the supporting cast His performance is so controlled and quiet in a De Niro sort of way it is a wonder how he ended up doing straight to video soft porn Michelle Pfeiffer of course adds the glamor Robert Loggia adds gravitas as usual and Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio makes a great debut as Tony s sister br br Of course this is more than just a film about excess There is more to it than drugs violence chainsaw assaults and a big great shoot out This is a film about the darker side of the American dream In many ways it puts it on a thematic par with The Godfather films Tony finds himself coming to America getting it all living the American dream and then losing it all in violent fashion and by saying he loses it all I mean he loses it all He kills his best friend his sister is killed his empire crumbles literally around him and to top it of he is killed in his own mansion bullets ripping through him br br Without doubt Scarface is one of the key films of the early 80 s Sure it doesn t have the subtleties of The Godfather films but this is still a fine film and one that is worth going to again and again
I heard a few friends one day saying that Scarface sucks some idiot tried to make another Godfather set in the early 80s Now I usualy listen to idiots watch CNN so I decided I d stay away from it Then my mate handed me the DVD and said This is 1 with the pelicangs confused I tried it This IS THE BEST FILM EVER MADE It s more realistic than all this crap about racing stolen cars that are too expensive for someone in that area could afford cough2Fast2Furiouscough There is some humor though i e the Pelicangs and the light 80s music Still whats better than Al Pacino wielding an m203 I give this a out of perfect for fans of Al or GTA Vice City
Most people who have seen this movie thinks that it is the best movie ever made I disagree but this movie is very very good Tony is a bad ass guy and knows that he s intimidating and uses it to get ahead It s about him and how he goes from washing dishes to having a huge house and a office with cocaine all over the desk If you want a family movie then this isn t the way to go but if you want mobsters and vengeance and stuff like that then you ll like it
I had the privilege of watching Scarface on the big screen with its beautifully restored 35mm print in honor of the 20th anniversary of the films release It was great to see this on the big screen as so much of it is lost on television sets and the overall largesse of this project cannot be emphasized enough br br Scarface is the remake of a classic rags to riches to the depths of hell story featuring Al Pacino as Cuban drug lord Tony Montana In this version Tony comes to America during the Cuban boat people immigration wave in the late 1970s early 1980s Tony and his cohorts quickly get green cards by offing a political figure in Tent City and after a brief stay at a Cuban restaurant Tony is launched on his horrific path to towards total destruction br br Many of the characters in this movie a played in such skilled manner that is so enjoyable to watch I have forgot little of this film over the last twenty years Robert Loggia as Tony s patron Frank Lopez is wonderful His character is flawed by being too trusting and as Tony quickly figures out soft Lopez s right hand Omar Suarez is portrayed by one of our greatest actors F Murray Abraham Amadeus Suarez is the ultimate toady and will do anything for Frank it is like he does not have a mind of his own Tony quickly sees this and he constantly battles with Suarez but really only sees him as a minor problem to get through on his way to the top The character that always comes back to me as being played so perfectly is Mel Bernstein the audaciously corrupt Miami Narcotics detective played by Harris Yulin Training Day Mel without guilt extorts great sums of money form all sides of the drug industry He plays Tony off of Frank until it catches up with him in a scene that marks the exit from the film of both Frank and Mel It is priceless to hear Frank asking for Mel to intercede as Tony is about to kill him only to hear Mel reply It s your tree Frank you re sitting in it This is from the man who Frank had been paying for protection br br Tony s rise is meteoric and is only matched in speed and intensity by his quick crash and burn After offing Frank and taking his wife and business Tony s greed takes over and he never can seem to get enough As Tony plunges deeper into the world of drugs greed and the inability to trust he eventually kills his best friend and his sister who had fallen in love and married This all sets up the ending in which Tony s compound is stormed by an army from his supplier who feels betrayed because Tony would not go through with a political assassination that was ordered This all stems form a compassionate moment when Tony refused to be an accomplice in a murder that would have involved the victim s wife and children br br All in all this is a great depiction of 1980s excess and cocaine culture DePalma does a nice job of holding it all together in one of the fastest moving three hour movies around The violence is extremely graphic and contains a few scenes that will be forever etched on any viewers mind particularly the gruesome chainsaw seen the two point blank shots to the head and the entire bloody melee that ends the movie This is a highly recommended stylistically done film that is not for the squeamish or for those who need upbeat endings and potential sequels DePalma let it all fly right here
Surely one of the mysteries of the modern world this film is NOT considered to be within the top 100 films of all time br br If you watched this film and thought it was anything other than wonderful please let me know how Al Pacino s performance is as good as it gets
if you like gangster type of movies then this is the first one you should buy or at least rent Al Pacino his performance is top notch and the story is classic 10 10 Why isn t this movie in the TOP 250 list
This is one of my favorite films of all time Al Pacino acting is at its best and the story is excellent Too bad it didn t do to well in the 80 s when it was first released because people didn t get a chance to experience this classic
Written by Oliver Stone and directed by Brian De Palma SCARFACE paints a picture not easily forgotten Al Pacino turns in a stunning performance as Tony Montana a Cuban refugee than becomes a powerful player in the drug world as he ruthlessly runs his self made kingdom of crime in Florida This gangster flick is harsh violent loud gross unpleasant and must hold the record for uttering the word f k the most number of times Almost three hours long and yes it can get repulsive A stout hearted constitution keeps you in your seat cheering for the demise of a ruthless crime lord br br Also playing interesting characters are Michelle Pfeiffer Steven Bauer Robert Loggia Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio F Murray Abraham and Angel Salazar Pacino proves to be one of the greatest of his generation He manages to bring reality to his character that leaves a strong impression This will not be a movie for everyone for you leave thinking you walked away from a disaster Is that powerful enough for you Crime does not pay for long
Many people like this movie and many more love it but it seems that it is all for the wrong reasons Scarface should be liked and loved but not in the way it has been or is br br Many people say the acting was over the top but who better to do an over the top character than Al Pacino To say that Pacino went over the top in here would be an understatement Yet he does it so well he just brings the inner devil out of you so well His character Tony Montana was not such a great guy to begin with but his thirst for power just bring his sickness of greed to another level an inhumane level Sure at times Pacino seems to be a bit cartoonish and surreal but that does not at all to me seem to be a liability at all The supporting cast served its job very well Michelle Pfeiffer was not really at her best but she certainly fit the role she played On the other hand Steven Bauer was at his best still he is Steven Bauer Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio was good and like Michelle Pfeiffer fit her role very well Robert Loggia I have always enjoyed watching in just seeing him yell Other than Pacino they were not really any standout or memorable performances Everybody just seemed to fit their roles by being there They did not fit in perfectly but were convincing enough br br Brian De Palma did a very good job directing this movie Whenever an actor is able to become larger than life with his performance some credit should be given to the director and I will certainly give De Palma that Brian De Palma though not given the respect is a very versatile director by my count He knows how to direct movies according to their genres but that at times has not turned out well In here it does this is by all counts a gangster movie but few are much better than this one because of De Palma br br The writing was great it was just pure Oliver Stone When I saw the credits at the end of this movie and saw that Oliver Stone had written this I was not the least bit surprised That is a testament to him though I have always though of him as a great writer and to me he proves this once again with Scarface Nobody knows how to write a surreal reality for a movie than Oliver Stone br br The music was good but not that great It is certainly not my favorite from Giorgio Moroder The music was a little bit too 80s ish for me but it didn t annoy me The cinematography was good not amazing but really who cares with a movie like this br br This has probably been one of the most influential movies in the past 25 years but as mentioned before it is for the wrong reasons People should realize that the character of Tony Montana is no hero he is a monster He is not inspiring in anyway He is greedy bloodthirsty uneducated and self consumed Yet he is a role model to many people because he is in some way or another a rebel but probably most of all because he is a deluded gangster A vigilante would be like Mother Tereasa next to Scarface br br The good thing about this movie though is that it shows that the Tony Montanas are not the real problem If we or the people of authority would want to shut people like him down we could do it but we don t In a freaky twisted way he is a necessity of our society He is somebody you could blame everything on and fell better about yourself doing it The Tony Montanas of this world are the scapegoats of our society This in no way excuses people like him Instead it is more of a reminder that we shouldn t excuse or allow ourselves to do bad things just because we measure up or think we measure up compared better to a gangster or drug dealer I love this movie because it is more than a corruption movie it is a movie that in a strange way makes you self reflect
In 1983 Director Brian De Palma set out to make a film about the rise and fall of an American gangster and that he did with the help of a terrific screenplay by Oliver Stone and some impeccable work by an outstanding cast The result was Scarface starring Al Pacino in one of his most memorable roles The story begins in May of 1980 when Castro opened the harbor at Mariel Cuba to allow Cuban nationals to join their families in the United States 125 000 left Cuba at that time for the greener pastures of freedom in America and most were honest hard working people thankful for the opportunity they had been granted But not all Among the Marielitos who streamed into Florida approximately 25 000 had criminal records and were nothing less than the dregs of Cuba s jails criminals considered beyond redemption who Castro had merely wanted to be rid of And they too saw America as a land of opportunity even as Al Capone had considered Chicago some fifty years earlier And among the most ambitious was a man named Tony Montana Pacino known to his associates as Caracortada Scarface br br Now that he was free of the yoke of Communism under which he had grown up Montana wanted what he felt was coming to him and he wanted it now and from the moment he stepped off the boat in Florida he was determined to have it all Wealth and power that was Montana s dream and he would get it by doing what he did best beginning with a favor for a man living in Miami by the name of Frank Lopez Robert Loggia Lopez it seems had a brother in Cuba who had met an untimely end at the hands of one of Castro s goons a man who having outlived his usefulness to Castro had been summarily discarded and was currently being held in Little Havana along with Montana and all of the Cubans just off the boats where they awaited their papers from the government that would effect their transition into their new lives And in short order Montana sees to it that Lopez s brother has been avenged and it sets the stage for his own entrance into the underworld of America br br Lopez a wealthy businessman with the right connections in return for the favor gets Montana and his friend Manny Steven Bauer released from the holding camp and puts them to work In his day Capone may have had bootlegging as a means through which to line his coffers with illicit gain but Lopez has the modern day equivalent and it s even more lucrative Cocaine Lopez takes Montana under his wing and indoctrinates him into the life but once he has a taste of it Montana isn t satisfied with whatever crumbs Lopez sees fit to throw his way and he sets a course that will take him to where he wants to be At the top With a cold blooded iron will Montana decides he ll do whatever it takes to get there no matter what the cost but before it s over he will realize the price for his dream and he ll pay it but for a brief moment perhaps he will know what it s like to be The Man And he will also know whether or not it was worth it br br In step with De Palma s vision Pacino plays Montana larger than life and he does it beautifully From the accent he affects which he researched thoroughly to make sure he got it right and he did to the body language and the attitude he s got it all and it makes Montana convincing and very real What he brings to the role is nuance and style in a way that few actors De Niro would be one can This is definitely not a character that is sympathetic in any way nor is there anything about Montana that you can readily relate to on a personal level but Pacino s screen presence is so strong that it makes him a thoroughly engrossing character even though it s hard to become emotionally involved with him It s quite simply a dynamic memorable performance br br Michelle Pfeiffer gives a solid performance as well in the role that put her on the path to stardom As Elvira the woman who becomes an integral part of Montana s dream Pfeiffer is subtle and understated giving that sense of something going on underneath while affecting a rather cold and distant exterior countenance She like Pacino definitely makes her presence felt as she fairly glides across the screen with a stoic enigmatic and sultry demeanor br br The supporting cast includes Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio Gina Miriam Colon Mama Montana F Murray Abraham Omar Paul Shenar Sosa and Harris Yulin Bernstein An excellent precursor to the more recent and highly acclaimed Traffic and Blow and well as having a climactic scene reminiscent of Peckinpah s The Wild Bunch De Palma s Scarface originally panned by critics has since been cited by many as being the definitive American gangster saga Much of the violence is implied rather than graphic but this film still has an edge of realism to it that many may find somewhat disturbing But if you stay with it there is a lesson to be learned in the end And like many lessons in life the most valuable are often the hardest to take at the time But the reward is always worth it and that s the way it is with this film I rate this one 8 10 br br br br br br
Arguebly Al Pacino s best role He plays Tony Montana A small time hood from Cuba turned into a rich and powerful crime lord in Miami and he does it with the only two things he s got in this world his balls and his word and he doesn t break em for nobody Starts as doing jobs for a big time Cuban dealer Frank Lopez Robert Loggia and quickly goes up the ladder of the organization along with his long time friend Manny Steven Bauer Soon he has an eye for the boss s sexy wife Elvira Michelle Pfeiffer After Frank sees a threat from Tony to his position he attempts to assassin Tony but with no luck Tony is upset and nothing can stop him now the film has a great supporting cast among them is F Murray Abraham as a jumpy gangster another familiar face is Harris Yulin as a crooked cop trying to shake down Tony Marry Elizabeth Mastrantonio as Tony s young sister Credits to the Ecxellent screenplay by Oliver Stone This film is one of Brian DePalma s Brightest points in his long ups and downs career you can see this guy is very talented The movie has a magnificent look to it Also pay attention for two memorable scenes The one at the fancy restaurant Say goodnight to the bad guy the other is the final shootout where Tony shows that he still knows how to kick ass and kills about 20 assassins that invaded to his house this is certainly one of the most impressive endings to a movie I have ever seen For fans of Al Pacino and crime movies it s a must see For the rest of you it s highly recommended 10 10
The story turns around Antonio Scarface Montana an ultra violent Cuban refugee who comes to the United States with less than nothing and makes a place for himself at the top of the cocaine trade br br As a calculating man with a conscience and extreme ambitions Tony strongly begins to desire the things he sees a criminal high roller enjoying including his luscious lover Heights his way out of a refugee camp by enjoying the chance to stab a former taker of Freedom takes out rival dealers gains the confidence of an important drug lord by eclipsing a local gang boss in Miami and eventually makes it to the highest levels of the drug organization br br Pacino shows the results of greed and lust for power on the human psyche He guns his way through the sunny streets of Miami where he got the world and everything in it With his ruthlessness obscene dialog and his negotiation skills he begins to imagine himself invulnerable and above all others He quickly moves deep to the world of gangs and becomes more ruthless than anyone else can possibly imagine br br Michelle Pfeiffer looks dazzling as the addicted wife with no inner life She succeeds in portraying the trophy object navigating uncertain waters with her anti hero Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio happens to be the best in Tony s life the only thing that is good and pure Her revulsion at the end of the movie is so fiery that her whole head could have blown off Robert Loggia exhibits a weak and fearful disposition especially when faced with Pacino as a challenger He proves to be a less ambitious boss in a position of power Steven Bauer shines as the man of charm loyal ally and faithful friend br br The Oliver Stone scripted Scarface is a change in genre lifting scene after scene of Hawks classic while updating the rise and fall gangster saga to modern drug infested Miami But as always the focus is on decadence profanity and violence memorably a sickening chainsaw murder rather than on the psychological and social reasons for the hoodlum s psychopathic behavior
Ya know when one looks at this Brian DePalma film today I m sure there has been allot of criticism about how dated it is Also about the violence When I looked at this film on VHS when I was 20 I thought it was ulta violent and gritty as well But I didn t get it br br A few decades go by and man how I know how much I didn t get in this film This is a remake of an excellent film which was done back in the 30 s 40 s How can you improve upon a classic Ya don t But you tell a tale that is brought up to date through the eyes of the new immigrants during the most greed ridden decade the over indulgent 80 s DePalma Stone and the gang present an ambitious disturbing and darn right good film br br Yes Disco was dying and New Wave Punk were taking over but these immigrants from Cuba who had to make a new home in Florida couldn t tell the difference It was exciting it was what they wanted but how to get it To these immigrants there was only one way to get it in Florida where they were by having lots of money and to get the money you had to take over running a drug empire br br Al Pacino was fantastic to me as Tony Montana the little train that could What an amazing way to have your lead character look at America to fight kill steal lie cheat all to get the money the women and the power br br That s what Tony saw as the American dream br br He wanted it he wanted to live it and in his circle saw nothing wrong with how he went to get it Tony Montana s command of the English language was heavily saturated with the f word but what did you expect Emily Post s finishing school for him and his co horts Look at how they CAME to America what they knew what they were exposed to This is the way Tony and his crew chose to be all they can be in America It was all about the power Tony Montana would and did ANYTHING to achieve it it all its violent lying stealing crooked thieving glory br br The part of the film that personified the 1980 s to me is the money laundering Tony s crew bringing sacks of drug money to the bank Did those around Tony and his crew care At the clubs where he spent and drank Nope Money was money and with money you get the power Tony was living high off the hog He and his pretty blond American trophy he married played well by Michelle Pfieffer br br After Tony Montana s rise to power he finds out its really crappy up there He s riddled with doubt he s drug addicted he s paranoid he s surrounded by those who want to take him on in a bloody take over his trophy 80 s American blonde drug addicted wife he finds out is a bore he needs to keep atop of his empire because he s going down And down he goes in a horrific violent fashion but again I ask what do you expect br br This is the quintessential 1980 s film telling you a warped tale of how some misunderstand the American Dream to obsession It s violent bloody overly so but it drives the point disturbingly home Not all Cubans thrown out of Cuba who landed in Florida in the 80 s were anything like Tony Montana Give me a break But the showing of how miserable the 1980 s were with its emphasis on greed and money as the only measures in the USA to be somebody and have power took its tool on these poor characters and their lives in America br br Makes you wonder has anything from then been learned today
Directed by Brian De Palma and written by Oliver Stone Scarface is a movie that will not be forgotten A Cuban refugee named Tony Montana Pacino comes to America for the American Dream Montana then becomes the king in the drug world as he ruthlessly runs his empire of crime in Miami Florida This gangster movie is very violent and some scenes are unpleasant to watch This movie has around 180 F words and is almost three hours long This movie is entertaining and you will never get bored You cheer for the Drug lord and in some scenes you find out that Montana isn t as evil as some other Crime Lords This is a masterpiece and i recommend that you see this You will not be disappointed 9 10
A Classic is something that everybody wants to have read but nobody wants to read A classic is also something that everyone praises but no one has read Mark Twain br br Classic seems to be the word used to describe Scarface Brian DePalma s 1983 film about opulence self surrender greed and danger among Florida s drug ring People and critics and rappers for that matter deem this film an epic gangster classic or eptiome of gangster films When it is anything but It is praised for all the wrong reasons Scarface is a terrific film that deserves praise from all over but not all the praise it gets from audiences today and therefor the fine points it so poignantly makes are missed by the general public br br First off the film is about a Cuban refugee with a past of wanting to escape communism grasp and find happiness Simple Yes But the layers of De Palma s directing genius and the great story written by Oliver Stone yes I know he actually wrote a real good one here play into all of it The characters are all looking for an escape as escape is a natural element dealt with in the film by all Each character has something to offer that makes them likable by everyone who could appreciate this film They are entwined in a world of mystique and money but all that has a price as they all learn Each character thinks they are getting better chances in life when in true dramatic irony they are actually getting worse Tragedy would be a better word to describe this movie All those who praise the film for it s drug usage it s violence it s dialog totally missed the point There is nothing really positive about the film besides the characters positive expectations of themselves And that is why the film works so well The devastation through out the film serves to deliver the message of the film not to look cool or attract viewers Brian De Palma doesn t make movies for cult gangsters or brainless action fans br br Next on the film is an adult drama It is not a gangster film It has it s share of action but the action is plotted very carefully so it has a point It s not like Aliens an example of a big dumb action film and most audiences perceive this film as a big dumb action gangster film about doing drugs and shooting people Ridiculous Hogwash If this film is about that then it is about how bad it is Not a promotion of it br br This being said the film is indeed a great film It has great cinematography that pulls you into the story It has a very dramatic score in true Giorgio Moroder style which simply could give you chills or bring you to tears The film is rather lengthy but it is a story and each moment counts The acting is terrific Al Pacino enough said He can do any role that he puts his mind to and this was no exception Pretty boy Steven Bauer as Manny I didn t think much of him in other films he did but he actually makes you like him when he goes under maestro De Palma s direction Michelle Pfeiffer is a true gem as Elvira Popping fresh off the heels of a sort of embarrassment in Grease 2 she got her ticket to ride performing a no holds barred performance of a beauty that is more than meets the eye But the three true diamonds in this rough are Mary Elizabeth Mastrontonio as Tony s sister Gina who when she smiles or cries we see her soul and her fresh way of living and watch it deteriorate Paul Shenar as Alejandro Sosa a drug lord who runs deeper than a river and Shenar portrays him as so and Miriam Colom as Tony and Gina s torn mother These three dig the film as deep as it can go br br This reviewer learned one main thing when watching Scarface for the first time Always go into a film unsuspecting All the hype and talk of this film cannot possibly prepare you for what you really see Only knowing De Palma like I do can give you even a glimpse of what this film holds So ignore the rap crap ignore the mindless violence supporters and fix yourself a glass of Bailey s on the rocks and indulge yourself in an emotional viewing of a great film the real Scarface
This is one of my all time favorites br br If the movie has a flaw it s that it comes at you like a raging bull It doesn t so much engage the viewer as assault him Scarface is as voracious and unyielding a production as Tony Montana himself Nothing is left to the viewer s imagination br br Moroder s languorous synthpop fits the action to a tee Like the chorus in a Greek tragedy it wails and gnashes broods and tugs a constant reminder of Tony s inexorable fate br br Not so much a tale of caution as a disaster in progress Scarface rips across the screen with the unstoppable force of a runaway train
Scarface has a major cult following even now 22 years after its release br br It has also been widely criticized as being very tacky unrefined over the top and all bloated up These are people who compare Scarface to The Godfather movies It is true that on the technical front cinematography screenplay direction etc Scarface is way behind The Godfather br br But it is also true that what Scarface has and some other gangster movies lack is the rawness the sheer crude approach of the gangsters The Latino gangsters in this movie look much more menacing and real than any of the polished Italian or Irish gangsters from other gangster classics like The Godfather or Goodfellas This is one of the major winning points of Scarface and I strongly believe that this fact has been written off as tackiness by most critics I have seen the original 1932 Scarface and I must say that both these movies are way too different from each other and should be seen as two different movies instead of praising the original over the remake br br Al Pacino has been criticized to be over the top and loud in this movie But how about considering that that is precisely the way the film makers wanted Tony Montana s character to be He is this angry young man who takes hasty decisions and throws fits of tantrum every other minute He is not the calm Michael Corleone here He is Tony Montana a very tacky uneducated individual who doesn t really think much and gets angry all the time br br There is definitely a very 80s feel to this movie The soundtrack is all 80s I love some of the songs including Gina and Elvira s theme Push it to the limit and the title track instrumental br br There are some memorable and beautifully shot sequences including the famous chainsaw scene the Rebenga hit the first meeting with Sosa and Tony s visit to his mother s br br About the performances Al Pacino is brilliant as the angry Cuban refugee He has reportedly mentioned that he enjoyed playing Tony Montana the most in his entire career And it really does seem like he has enjoyed himself thoroughly in all his scenes One wonders what Scarface would be like without Pacino I just couldn t imagine anyone else portraying Tony Montana and in all probabilities the film wouldn t be as effective without him br br Steven Bauer shines as Tony s friend Manny br br Robert Loggia is wonderful as Tony s boss Lopez So is F Murray Abraham as Omar in a small role br br Then there is some eye candy in the form of Elvira played by Michelle Pfeiffer She looks beautiful and is adequate in her role br br The director does go a bit overboard during a particular part in the climax Without revealing anything I would only say that that was the only little part that suffers due to improper handling br br Scarface is definitely one of the most entertaining and one of the best gangster movies to ever come out Enjoy it for what it is a raw portrayal of the Drug Lords and their gangland
Every great gangster movie has under currents of human drama Don t expect an emotional story of guilt retribution and despair from Scarface This is a tale of ferocious greed corruption and power The darker side of the fabled American Dream br br Anybody complaining about the cheesiness of this film is missing the point The superficial characters cheesy music and dated fashions further fuel the criticism of this life of diabolical excess Nothing in the lives of these characters really matter not on any human level at least In fact the film practically borderlines satire ironic considering all the gangsta rappers that were positively inspired by the lifestyle of Tony Montana br br This isn t Brian DePalma s strongest directorial effort it is occasionally excellent and well handled particularly the memorable finale but frequently sinks to sloppy and misled Thankfully it is supported by a very strong script by Oliver Stone probably good therapy for him considering the coke habit he was tackling at the time The themes are consistent with the focus primarily on the life of Tony Montana and the evolution of his character as he is consumed by greed and power The dialogue is also excellent see sawing comfortably between humour and drama There are many stand out lines which have since wormed their way into popular culture in one form or another br br The cast help make it what it is as well but this is really Pacino s film One of his earlier less subtle performances something much more common from him nowadays this is a world entirely separate from Michael Corleone and Frank Serpico Yet he is as watchable here as ever in very entertaining and intentionally over the top form It is hard to imagine another Tony Montana after seeing this film in possibly one of the most mimicked performances ever Pfeiffer stood out as dull and uncomfortable on first viewing but I ve come to realize how she plays out the part of the bored little wife Not an exceptional effort but unfairly misjudged The supporting players are very good too particularly Paul Shenar as the suave Alejandro Sosa br br Powerful occasionally humorous sometimes shocking and continually controversial Scarface is one of the films of the eighties whatever that might mean to you An essential and accessible gangster flick and a pop culture landmark 9 10
This movie was for a while in my collection but it wasn t before a friend of mine reminded me about it until I decided that I should watch it I did not know much about Close to Leo just that it was supposed to be excellent coming out of age movie and it deals with a very serious topic Aids br br Although the person who has aids is Leo the scenario wraps around the way in which Marcel the youngest brother of Leo coupes with the sickness of his relative At first everyone is trying to hide the truth from Marcel he is believed to be too young to understand the sickness of his brother the fact that Leo is also a homosexual contributes to the unwillingness of the parents to discus the matter with the young Marcel I know from experience that on many occasions most older people do not want to accept the fact that sometimes even when someone is young this does not automatically means that he will not be able to accept the reality and act in more adequate manner then even themselves With exception of the fact that the family tried to conceal the truth from Marcel they have left quite an impression for me the way they supported their son even after discovering the truth about his sexuality and his sickness The fact that they allowed the young Marcel to travel along with Leo to Paris to meet his ex boyfriend was quite a gesture from them most families I know will be reluctant to do that There is a lot of warmth in the scenes in which the brothers spend some time together you can see them being real friends concern about each other br br Close to Leo is an excellent drama which I strongly recommend
I saw this movie about a week ago and still keep thinking about it I was very moved by this movie I found the characters very believable and likable almost to a fault As in real life though sometimes people disappoint as was the case with Leo who even though I liked his character I could not have been more disappointed when he was willing to have unprotected sex even though fully aware of his HIV status I was also disappointed with Leo for rejecting the medicine available to him and the awful way he treated Marcel when he decided to ship him back home on the train I think this movie showed in a very real way why HIV numbers are up in young gay men This is in no way meant to bash gays I am gay and movie very well could have been made about a young straight person who makes bad choices and seems unaware of the consequences to himself and others The only part of the movie I couldn t understand was why the gay friendly family was unwilling to include Marcel in Leo s illness to the point of not allowing him to go to the funeral br br I think the biggest message from this movie is that whether gay or straight is DO NOT HAVE UNPROTECTED SEX
I found this film to be a fascinating study of a family in crisis When Leo the oldest announces that he is HIV the reactions of the family members alone and with each other was touching and yet strange br br I have never seen a family that was as physically demonstrative as this one nor one as likely to shout at each other I didn t understand why the family felt that youngest couldn t deal with the news but once past that difficult I found this a thoroughly moving film br br
This film made for French TV deals with the tragic effect it has for a close knit family When Leo the young man at the center of the story is diagnosed as having the AIDS virus announces it to his parents they just can t believe it The film is a character study on how this family deals with its subject br br The director Christophe Honore has to be congratulated for bringing this frank account to the screen Nowhere but in France could this story make it to the movies because of the subject matter br br The news has a devastating effect on Marcel the young brother who hears about what Leo has contracted in spite of the way the parents want to shelter him from reality br br Yaniss Lespart and Pierre Mignard do a convincing job in portraying the brothers
I loved this movie First because it is a family movie Second because it offers a refreshing take on dealing with the news of HIV in a family with far less hysteria than what I have normally seen in the movies The brothers are very close yet are not judgmental Their desire to protect the youngest brother is noble but not needed in the end I understand that Leo s choice on how to deal with his treatment may not have been the most popular one with people but I believed it was the right choice for him I can t believe that this was a french television programme It had great production values I gave this movie a ten and I think you will too once you have seen it
It is projected that between 2000 and 2020 68 million people will die prematurely as a result of AIDS The projected toll is greatest in sub Saharan Africa where 55 million additional deaths can be expected Beyond the grim statistics are personal stories that we rarely hear about Christophe Honor√© describes one of the most moving in Close to Leo a film produced for French television as part of a series dealing with issues facing young people Though fictional it deals with a situation that is unfortunately too common the effect of a diagnosis of HIV on a loving close knit family br br When twenty one year old Leo Pierre Mignard tells his parents and two teenage brothers Tristan Rodolphe Pauley and Pierrot Jeremie Lippmann that he has AIDS the family is devastated Out of concern for his youth they decide to withhold the information from his youngest brother 12 year old Marcel Yannis Lespert but he overhears the conversation and begins to sulk and act erratically When Leo goes to Paris for treatment he takes Marcel with him but the young boy confronts Leo and demands to know the truth Leo tells him that he is ill and Marcel is sad but accepting When he brings Marcel along to meet some former gay friends however tension between them boils to the surface setting the stage for a riveting conclusion br br Although I was uncomfortable with scenes in bed involving physical contact between the brothers I feel that the sincerity of Close to Leo and the brilliant performances by Lespert and Mignard more than tip the scales in its favor Seeing events unfold from the young boy s perspective gives the film an authenticity that reminded me of the Quebecois film Leolo and Truffaut s The 400 Blows Unlike some American films that dance around the anguish of AIDS Close to Leo tells a harsh truth but does so in a way that is tender and wonderfully real
It was very heart warming As an expatriated french I particularly enjoyed this TV movie which I think deserves a broader distribution The acting was good and the bonds between each member of this rural French family seemed so br br strong and so natural No doubt a great movie about the concept of family and inclusion in the face of homosexuality and AIDS One of the strongest aspect of the movie is this privileged relationship between the eldest son Leo who has contracted HIV and the youngest son Marcel to whom the rest of the family try to hide the situation The two characters br br progressively explore each other as time runs out for Leo who is not willing to spend the rest of his life surviving under drugs
Well made but basically dreary low life melodrama which according to the accompanying interview with lead Isabelle Huppert writer director Pialat infused with a good deal of autobiographical detail given the mainly unsympathetic characters involved it doesn t do him any compliments and he does seem to have been a troubled man as Huppert also says that Pialat often disappeared for days on end during the shoot br br The acting is uniformly excellent however despite their relatively young age Huppert and co star Gerard Depardieu as the title character were already at the forefront of modern French stars a status which with varying degrees of success they both still hold to this day br br I have 3 more of Pialat s films in my VHS To Watch pile albeit all in French without English Subtitles due to this fact but also LOULOU S oppressive realism in spite of its undeniable artistic merit I can t say that I m in any particular hurry to check them out now
This is quite a dull movie Well shot with realistic performances especially a very good one from Depardieu as a cad and bad boy with realistic locations mood and art house connotations all over it fails because the director takes no position stand or critical commentary on the topic he stipulates One of France s revered and regular working partner on films with Depardieu I believe they made 7 together Pialat fails to engage It seems to be a treatise on why women fall for the bad boy who will hurt when they have a ready caring boyfriend and good hearted husband around Isabelle Hupert who plays the philanderer with nonchalant distinction offers opprobrium answers like I don t know I like his arms I like the way he makes love to her inquiring husband who tries to kick her out of the house but palliates and reconsiders because I assume he loves her So he accepts and hope for what That she will one day wake up and come to her senses Things like this are not answered in Pialat s condescending docu drama style with long speeches and even longer scenes that don t add up I know the answers do not add up but please take a stand Jules et Jim this is not The final shot as cold as the movie we have just watched is a heartache and headache only to the most forgiving
Loulou delights in the same way an expensive high quality French wine does It leaves you with a very fine aftertaste br br Loulou s theme isn t new The film doesn t carry an original plot either Its colored picturing shows fine but not extraordinary Its setting is serious Its elegant styling never and nowhere puts any weight on your mind br br Whatever one further may say about Loulou it s beyond doubt that this very French film stands out for its excellent acting The three leads convincingly reflect all numerous doubts and tenses sparkling between them making the plot alive Their acting fully invites you to participate to make friends br br For those around at the time Loulou also provides an extra bonus its perfectly captured mood of 1980
Pialat films people in extreme emotional situations usually with several violent scenes In La Gueule ouverte he s dealing with the devastating effects on a woman s husband and son as she dies of cancer In A nos amours the teenage girl s sexual experimentation leads to violent confrontations with her family Here we have a rather spoiled young woman who abandons her husband to take up with a sexy ex con Her motivation is a little cloudy since Loulou is incapable of reading or discussing anything more challenging than TV shows on the other hand he s got a fabulous body I wonder why Depardieu never made a sports movie to show off that physique he would have been great as a rugby player br br The casting is impressive Isabelle Huppert isn t allowed to give a bland inexpressive performance she has given many Depardieu plays Loulou with all the dynamism and charm you could want see the scene in the bar where he s stabbed in the gut runs away and seeks treatment then soon restarts with Nelly Guy Marchand with those coal black eyes and distressed look plays Nelly s husband beautifully it s a fine repeat of the pairing in Coup de foudre
The subsequent two seasons of this original series was less than lacklustre The latter seasons disastrous reshuffle contributed to its three season short life span Maybe if the plug was pulled after the first season it would ve gained a cult following br br Aside from that the first season was truly hilarious Witty clever with superb writing it was promising The first season s excellent brew had the right ingredients characters actors storyline and so forth Plus a comedy about a paparazzi reporter was original to boot Nora and her fellow photographers on the prowl night after night day after day for the exclusives br br A lot of things don t make sense to me Like how this show and another fav of mine Gross Pointe never made it If only the first seasons of the Naked Truth and Grosse Pointe were released on DVD please anyone out there
A truly adorable heroine who at turns is surprised and terrified by giblets wrestles with mattresses runs full on into closed doors just a few of the moments that sparkle in my memory of The Naked Truth I LOVED what I caught of this show enjoyably daft plots and some good supporting characters provided the setting for the diamond of the show Tea Leoni as Nora Wilde cute clownish and wonderfully accident prone How refreshing to see an actress who can clown it s no wonder Hollyood doesn t seem to know how to cast her But where oh WHERE are the DVD releases The amount of bleep they release it s incredible me that this little gem continues to remain buried Someone please correct me if I m wrong
Tea Leoni plays Nora Wilde a serious photographer who is going through a bad divorce She wants her freedom but it comes at a cost She wants to legitimate photography but is hired to work for the tabloids as a paparazzi Her boss is played by the wonderful and divine Holland Taylor The show was well written most of the time TEa s Nora was beginning to develop into quite a memorable character but the network just didn t support comedy and they still don t Even when they brought in George Wendt from Cheers they made unnecessary changes in casting and characters The show was fine in the beginning and the audience was getting used to it but then the network botches it up like a bad plastic surgery
I stumbled across rerun syndication of this show several years ago and fell in love with it It features T√©a Leoni and Holland Taylor and kept me laughing one episode after the next I guess it didn t make it so big and was cancelled after a few seasons but I believe it was a good run and would suggest watching it if the opportunity arises
This is a nice little horror flick that fans of indie films will really appreciate It has good acting lots of gore and a decent plot One will be reminded of movies like The Hills Have Eyes and Pumpkinhead It s obvious that the budget was not all that big but the film really makes up for it with atmosphere and solid performances by the actors which seems to be lacking in a lot of today s big budget special effects filled films The film really moves along and there is excellent direction and good camera work There are no wasted scenes so the film s length is a bit short In addition it looks like the ending leaves an opening for a sequel which would be very interesting as well So grab some popcorn turn down the lights and enjoy this one
This movie is a perfect portrayal of The Nutcracker the dancing is wonderful the scenery in the background was excellent and I LOVED THAT FLOATING BED br br Oh and the costumes I particularly loved Marzipan s the tutu was adorable The special effects were very well done e g the tree the bed etc and I quite enjoyed the rats I love how they didn t make them scary but cute and huggable Except for the king I suppose br br If you re a thoroughly masculine person you won t enjoy this but this is a very good movie that s good for all ages just not all levels of testosterone br br But I have a few complaints br br Firstly why did they have to put the Sugar Plum Fairy s partner in those terrible tights It would barely make a difference if he was butt naked And secondly why on EARTH did they have to make Culkin s outfit PINK
Those who have given this production such a low rating probably have never seen the celebrated George Balanchine production live onstage or are letting their disdain for the star casting of Macaulay Culkin influence their judgement The Atlanta Ballet was fortunate enough from the 1960 s to the 1980 s to be the first ballet company authorized to stage this production other than the New York City Ballet and I have seen it live onstage several times I can assure readers that the film is a quite accurate rendering of this production and that the use of a child with limited dancing abilities in the title role is not a cheap stunt dreamed up to showcase Culkin it was Balanchine s idea to use a child in this role just as it was his idea to use a child for the role of Marie The heavy dancing is left to the adults in the story br br This is deliberately a stagebound film in a way it resembles Laurence Olivier s Othello Exactly as in that film the sets of the stage production have been enlarged to the size of a movie soundstage but not made any less artificial and the ballet is straightforwardly photographed with discreet closeups and without the distracting music video quick cuts featured in the 1986 overrated Maurice Sendak Carroll Ballard version There are only two false steps in this 1993 film One is the addition of distracting and completely unnecessary sound effects mouse squeaks the children whispering Ma gic to Drosselmeyer etc Those sound effects are never heard in any stage production of any Nutcracker and they have been put in as a cheap concession simply to appease unsophisticated audiences who may not relish the idea of watching a ballet on film br br The other false step is Macaulay Culkin s nutcracker make up which looks absolutely ridiculous When he is on screen as the Nutcracker rather than wearing a huge mask as is always done when the Balanchine production is performed onstage Culkin is actually made up as the toy he wears what looks like a bald cap as well as a white wig whiskers and a beard He also has his face rouged up somewhat and the worst aspect of his make up is that it is still recognizably his face amateurishly transformed in a manner similar to Ray Bolger Jack Haley and Bert Lahr s makeups in The Wizard of Oz that film s makeup results though worked spectacularly as this one s does not And a comparison with Baryshnikov s nutcracker in his production shows how wonderfully creative Baryshnikov s nutcracker mask was the jaws actually seemed to move whenever Baryshnikov tilted his head back br br The dancing itself in the Macaulay Culkin version is excellent of course except for Culkin himself whose dancing as I said isn t meant to even be spectacular The Sugar Plum Fairy and her Cavalier are the prominent dancing roles in Balanchine s production of The Nutcracker The film s colors though could be a bit brighter since this IS a fantasy The choreography is also brilliant and the adaptation of it is so faithful as to include the sequence that features additional music from Tchaikovsky s ballet The Sleeping Beauty as Marie sneaks downstairs falls asleep on the sofa and dreams that Drosselmeyer is repairing the broken Nutcracker this sequence was of course never included in Tchaikovsky s original ballet it is the only sequence in this production which features music from a work other than The Nutcracker br br Those who have missed out on this film or those who despise or loathe it should give it a chance despite its two big drawbacks It is far better than it seems when one first hears that Culkin is in it
Both visually and musically stunning A treat for both the eye and the ear The quintessential Victorian element of the opening sequences were completely enchanting helping to create a Christmas scene of which Dickens himself would have been justifiably proud Technically the production is visually stimulating and the special effects are both imaginatively devised and creatively achieved in a traditional stage setting The dancing of many of the lead artistes is breathtakingly good The photography and lighting are first class and the sound recording admirably matches the overall high level of technical skills employed A great film for all the family at Christmas time and a most delightful discovery which will withstand multiple viewing
As far as I can recall Balanchine s alterations to Tchaikovsky s score are as follows br br 1 The final section of the Grossvatertanz a traditional tune played at the end of a party is repeated several times to give the children a last dance before their scene is over br br 2 A violin solo written for but eliminated from Tchaikovsky s score for The Sleeping Beauty is interpolated between the end of the party scene and the beginning of the transformation scene Balanchine chose this music because of its melodic relationship to the music for the growing Christmas tree that occurs shortly thereafter br br 3 The solo for the Sugar Plum Fairy s cavalier is eliminated br br It seems to me the accusation that Balanchine has somehow desecrated Tchaikovsky s great score is misplaced
This movies chronicles the life and times of William Castle He made a series of low budget horror films in the 1950s 1960s that he sold with gimmicks In 13 Ghosts you need viewers to see the ghosts they were in color the film was in b w The Tingler had theatre seats equipped with a buzzer that jolted the audience when a monster escapes into a movie theatre Marabre issued a life insurance policy to all members in case they were frightened to death The movies themselves were pretty bad but the gimmicks had people rushing to see them In this doc there are interviews with directors inspired by Castle actors in his movies and his daughter It also gets into his home life and the kind of man he was by all accounts he was a great guy The documentary is affectionate very funny and absolutely riveting It s very short under 90 minutes and there s never a dull moment A must see for Castle fans and horror movie fans My one complaint there were very few sequences shown from his pictures That aside this is just great
I was lucky enough to catch this movie while volunteering at the Maryland Film Festival I ve always been a fan of classic horror films and especially the gimmicks of William Castle so this was definitely a must see for me br br This is about the life and work of William Castle who in my opinion was an underrated director True he made some cheap budget schlocky horror films but he added something to these films real live theater gimmicks that you don t see anymore For example he had nurses in case someone had a heart attack at his movies and put vibrators at the bottoms of chairs in THE TINGLER br br This is truly a well made documentary and brings this rather shadowed director into the light and celebrated his contributions to horror cinema It also paints Castle as a larger than life character who was very well liked and had a smile on his face br br Unlike most film documentaries that mostly show testaments from film historians SPINE TINGLER shows interviews mostly from his family members and directors who were influenced by his work such as John Waters John Landis and Joe Dante A must see for classic horror and sci fi fans
I gave it a 10 since everyone else seemed to like it and it would have been churlish not to The reason I m troubling you is to add a personal observation on Castle s work br br I ve seen Homicidal and The Tingler the version with the clever colour sequence where everything except the blood is in black and white a few times and The House On Haunted Hill many times br br Even I am not old enough to have seen them when Castle was up to his showman tricks thus I can appreciate them for their own merit And while most pass him off as second rate schlocky hammy etc I believe they do him a disservice br br The end sequence of Homicidal is GENUINELY shocking and works today and the premise of The Tingler while silly was highly original br br But The House On Haunted Hill was a TRIUMPH Having used that Frank Lloyd Wright house as its exterior the great Vincent Price and a solid cast plus a good score and production values when I first saw it at a packed late night showing in the late Sixties it produced an audience reaction I d not seen before and have not seen since br br It was the bit where the heroine is alone in the basement if you ve not seen the film stop reading NOW and we are waiting to hear the hero on the other side of the wall br br With NO telegraphing of what is coming the camera slowly pulls back forcing the AUDIENCE to switch their gaze to I m saying no more my spoiler declaration above only covers THIS movie br br The point is I believe this ploy was DELIBERATE not accidental and when it happened the WHOLE AUDIENCE SCREAMED including most of the men It took the audience about TEN MINUTES to calm down br br Now THAT is superior film making A flamboyant showman he might have been but House and the other two films I ve mentioned were GOOD MOVIES Castle may not have been a Hitchcock but he was no Ed Wood either br br It s easy to concentrate on someone s quirks and forget to examine their TALENT So I hope this documentary acknowledged that I look forward to seeing it
William Castle is notorious among horror fans as the B grade director of the 1950s and 60s His gimmicks his cost cutting techniques and his unique vision are legendary It comes as no surprise then that someone Jeffrey Schwarz who s made countless documentaries would finally take the time to devote a documentary to his greatness Such is Spine Tingler The William Castle Story br br I had a general understanding of who Castle was having seen some of his films over the years I knew nothing about her personal life his goals and ambitions This film really fleshed out the man and gave me a fuller appreciation for the devotion he had for the craft of film making and his contributions to the horror genre The movie depicts Castle as rival to Alfred Hitchcock with Hitch being the artist who wins praise while Castle is the carnival barker who gains cult notoriety but much less respect He is an icon to all second rate directors out there which is why it s not surprising that John Waters is featured prominently in here Joe Dante and Stuart Gordon also have sizable roles br br His gimmicks were what drove his fame and the documentary takes great pains to explain them which is crucial for those who are too young to remember The rudimentary 3 D of 13 Ghosts see separate review the buzzer in the seat for The Tingler see separate review money back guarantees for Homicidal watching these films now outside the theater we can judge them for their content which personally I still enjoy but we cannot fully appreciate what audiences once felt br br The climax of the film is when Castle goes from cult director to Hollywood producer Having bought the rights to Rosemary s Baby he is put in a very special place for negotiating its film release Hoping to direct he is sidelined to producer in order to make way for new director Roman Polanski While at first disappointed this proves to be one of the best opportunities of his lifetime a hugely successful film and a job he excels at Who better to control the purse of wild artist Polanski than a penny pinching Castle This was to be his crowning achievement though sadly the film is more often connected to Polanski than Castle br br The remainder of his years are played out and we are given personal reflections by his daughter and niece Across the board everyone seems to have nothing but praise for the man Somewhere along the way he surely upset one or two people but you would never know it from this film And I find that find this is a celebration of Bill Castle s life not E True Hollywood Story Fans of the genre would do well to pick up a copy of this work br br I would personally recommend picking up the William Castle Collection which has not only this but eight of Castle s films in it with plenty of special features Even this documentary comes with an audio commentary so you can hear how Schwarz was personally affected by Castle and have Castle s daughter Terry giving a running reflection of her experiences with the different films and remakes It s almost a whole new film
This documentary on schlockmeister William Castle takes a few cheap shots at the naive 50s 60s environment in which he did his most characteristic work look at the funny silly people with the ghost glasses but it s also affectionate and lively with particularly bright commentary from John Waters who was absolutely the target audience for such things at the time and from Castle s daughter who adored her dad and also is pretty perceptive about how he plied his craft We never find out what became of the other Castle offspring The movies were not very good it makes clear but his marketing of them was brilliant and he appears to have been a sweet hardworking family man Fun people keep popping up like Straight Jacket s Diane Baker who looks great and Anne Helm whom she replaced at the instigation of star Joan Crawford Darryl Hickman all but explodes into giggles at the happy memory of working with Castle on The Tingler and there s enough footage to give us an idea of the level of Castle s talent not very high but very energetic A pleasant look at a time when audiences were more easily pleased and it does make you nostalgic for simpler movie going days
Hitchcock was of the opinion that audiences aren t really interested in what puts protagonists into danger only that they ARE in danger and need to escape br br This film proves Hitchcock was not 100 correct Police believe Jean Simmons is guilty of a crime when she plainly isn t Trevor Howard decides their best course of action is to run for it And so the body of the movie has our charismatic pair dodging on and off trains buses and coaches jumping across rocks at the top of a waterfall scrambling across dockyard roofs br br All good exciting stuff but I couldn t get out of my mind that it was all unnecessary They should have stayed put br br In other words the MacGuffin wasn t strong enough
This film plays really well with an audience Especially once the chase begins Plus Trevor Howard with his sensible smart charms and Jean Simmons with her innocent demeanor and piercing eyes are terrific together br br The film starts as a psychological drama but after the murder it segues into a chase thriller as the two leads head for the border Some may think the chase is superfluous but actually the chase is essential because it aids in clearing the mind of the Jean Simmons character by getting her out of the oppressive household plus it helps bring out the real killer who is suddenly put into such a position that they have to finish the job The killer rightly believed that once the Simmons character was arrested she would be put away And it is true that her lack of control in the household as well as evidence pointing her way there is no way she would have gotten out of the murder charge The chase that ensues helps bring out the truth br br This is an entertaining film Seek it out if you can find it
A young woman Jean Simmons is convinced by her scheming and dangerous aunt Sonia Dresdel and uncle Barry Jones that she s losing her mind and in very delicate condition that requires their supervision which turns out to be more like manipulation as they try to keep her as far away from outside human contact as possible The only other person she sees is the estate caretaker a lascivious character played by Maxwell Reed whose caught the wayward eye of the middle aged aunt All of this the aunt and the caretaker the butterfly expert uncle who has a serious underside to him and the susceptible niece in the middle would have made for a darker and more sinister film As it is a frame up for a murder sends Trevor Howard a fired government secret service agent who took a job at the estate cataloging butterflies and Simmons across the countryside escaping police catching headlines of Police Net Closing In over her front page photo hopping on buses and winding up in Liverpool where they meet some wonderfully cast characters and finally face down the greedy and murderous aunt and uncle
A delightful little thriller opens with Trevor Howard in his Jag convertible and ends on a dockside in Liverpool It s all thrills and spills as the ex spy has to restart his career just as he s getting some serious R R cataloguing butterflies how British is that br br Trevor Howard and Jean Simmons frolic from London to Newcastle upon Tyne to Liverpool via Ullswater he s just been thrown out of MI5 or something and she you guessed it is on the run wrongly accused of murder There s seedy docks rolling Lake District hills sheep country pubs coppers getting lost waterfalls a bunch of amateur cyclists rooftop chases and lots of Chinamen don t ask and it s all very Hitchcocky and Hannayesque br br and a smashing example of British Noir
The Clouded Yellow is a compact psychological thriller with interesting characterizations Barry Jones and Kenneth More are both terrific in supporting roles in characters that both have more to them than what meets the eye Jean Simmons is quite good and Trevor Howard makes a fascinatingly offbeat suspense hero
I enjoyed Albert Pyun s Nemesis for its cheesy action and semi complicated script A lot of people complain about the confusing plot to the first film which is probably why Nemesis 2 Nebula has a dumb as rocks plot with the same super action to carry it through br br This one gives the name of the first movie s hero Alex to a bulked up super female sent to the past to save the future She is raised by a tribe in Africa A good portion of the film only has dialogue in an African tongue without subtitles which I liked because it made it seem somewhat authentic how often do movies in this genre really try to do that It doesn t take long for the evil cyborgs to time travel back in time to find her and try to kill her br br Don t get me wrong this is a piece of crap not that the first one was anything great There are subplots involving Africa s political unrest treasure hunting and tribal combat The picture is very short on brains so none of these things gets a very good treatment The picture is basically a drawn out fight with some chases that boils down to muscle babe vs cyborg It has its entertainment value just don t expect quality or anything of the first movie
This is an excellent film for female body builder female action fans I think that Sue Price did a great job in this film series Nemesis 2 3 4 and proved to be a great fighter She has a very striking appearance and a will of iron to resist the powerful Nebula Nemesis 2 Though not a film of great value and Sue Price s acting skills not the best to have met in my life the movie itself was something awesome a priceless gem for fans of female body builder action Well some parts of Nemesis 2 have been copied by other famous sci fi films such as Terminator or Predator but that s not the point The point is that A Puyn casted in that film a very talented body builder who put all of her energy and body talent to show us the best she can do I really enjoyed that film and watched with the same enthusiasm Nemesis 3 a rather boring sequel and Nemesis 4 a much more interesting sequel than 3 What a pity it hasn t shown yet on DVD
You know this movie isn t that great but I mean c mon it s about angels helping a baseball team I find the plot line to be hilarious anyways this kid s dad says he ll take him back if the angels win the pennant because he knows they won t Kid prays to his fake god to help the angels win god helps the whole time via the angel Christopher Lloyd RIP And in the end his dad doesn t take him back and rides off on his motorcycle right in that kids face it s hilarious until Danny Glover adopts it and it s friend br br I guess the upside is that the old lady is left alone to die with her stitchin projects and her stories The real winner here though is god Because later he got a job as a writer for numerous prank shows br br As a kids movie it gets a 7 As a movie about the mysteries of blind stupid faith and the nature of god it gets a 10
But how can you stand to mange a baseball team that can t win For George Knox it is not easy As the movie opens Roger Beaumont Joseph Gordon Levitt and his best friend J P Milton Davis Jr are riding on thier bikes around the angels stadium When they return to thier foster mother s home Roger is suprised to have a visit from his dad Dermot Mulroney His mom is dead And when he asks his father when they going to be a family again he father jokes I say when the angels win the division championship So later on Roger and J P hide in a tree to watch the angels play baseball When the manger George Knox Danny Glover take out his pitcher the pitcher gets mad and gets into a fight with him and soon the angels team get into the fightm that gets Knox ejected from the game That night Roger makes a prayer for the angles win the championship When his foster mother Maggie Nelson Brenda Ficker agrees that Roger and J P go to a basball Roger sees real angles come on the field and helps the left fielder Matthew McConaughey makes a catch that leaves the manger and the play by play man Jay O Sanders how did he to that Roger learns from the head angel Christopher Lloyd that only he can see the angles because he was the only that prayed for help br br 10 10
With all the Adult innuendos in todays family movies its nice to see one where you don t have to worry about that and can just sit back and enjoy a family with your kids Yes this movie might have a few swear words there s that time where Knox swears but they don t let you hear the full words but for the most part this movie is truly as clean as they come and that s including movies from back in the day Not only that its very enjoyable one of my favorites and just a great clean and fun movie to watch with the family br br The only thing I have against this movie is that it is too short and I wish there could be more of some of the memorable parts that are in it I m not going to mention them because I don t want any spoilers here br br All in all nicely done and a great movie to watch so go out and get the kids make some cookies and watch this movie
Yeah the archetype of a simple but inspirational movie The very end when the entire crowd in the stadium gets up and the people raise their hands gives me a chill whenever I see it That s just brilliant Joseph is wonderful as the lonely and sad kid who has so far been disappointed by anyone and anything in his life The way he interacts with Danny Glover and tries to make him believe in the magic and the angels is funny and exhilarating A very nice family movie with I concede a rather corny happy end But hey it doesn t really matter the movie retains its basic quality by the good acting and the inspirational themes
Angels in the Outfield was originally a 1951 movie from the Ted Turner library Disney remade it in 1994 this time using the California Angels now the Los Angeles Angels as the team Disney used to own this and the Anaheim Mighty Ducks Hockey Team also good use of the words huh br br This movie was about a couple of orphaned children who wanted a family A man promised the boys a family only if the Angels won the pennant So he called upon God one night about this The boy who prayed could see the help coming on the way and ONLY that boy for instance when the first angel had come down a player hit a ball so hard not only did the bat break so did the ball For much of the post All Star season of 1994 the Angels were at the top of the AL West of which my home team the Rangers is one and it still is However they lost a game because the boy was at court instead of the White Sox Angels game there was no Central Division in Baseball back then hence Chicago being in the West and no angels were there to help Thus a new rule was created no angels can help in championship games But wait In the final championship game the Angels won It was a miracle indeed br br What I liked about this film This is a good movie I mean I prayed every night for the last few years asking for help with school and stuff look at me now My work was good So for one this shows that if you believe God can send His angels down to help you with any troubles that you may have in life And second this is a family baseball movie which is always exciting This is an old Disney movie too I ve seen this just recently on the New Disney Channel blech br br Angels in the Outfield will change your life forever once you ve seen it br br 10 10
This movie is perfect for families to watch together It is a great film and it deserves more credit The special effects are stunning and spectacular Everyone who has children should share this with theirs
Christopher Lloyd is funny and really believable as Al the head angel This movie is much better than the first but it has great special effects that the first did not have as well as a much better plot and writing br br OK it was written for kids but adults have as much fun as the kids do Tony Danza does a very realistic job in his role but this is NOT a Taxi reunion br br Danny Glover is actually good and even seems to be very human in his emotions as well as showing some real acting talent for a change a pleasant change br br Watch at least once it is worth the effort to catch it
this movie was one of the best disney movies i ve ever seen great for the entire family to watch the ideas may be a little far fetched but it s a feel good comedy and the acting is great love the little boy j p and academy award winner adrien brody s part may have been very short but very memorable highly recommended
One of Disney s best films that I can enjoy watching often you may easily guess the outcome but who cares its just plain fun escape for 1 hour forty two minutes and after all wasn t movies meant to get away from reality for just a short time anyway The cast sparkles with delight magictrain

I happened to catch this movie on cable one afternoon I have to admit that I ve never been a big baseball fan but I can sometimes get into a good sports related movie What I found more interesting was the depiction of the foster family system As a therapist who has seen both the good and the bad of the community mental health and foster system I though it was rather refreshing to see a movie that showed both the ups and downs of this system people jumping from family to family biological parents not always taking an active involvement and transitions that can be but heart wrenching and heart melting Joseph Gordon Levitt and Danny Glover are the anchor of this film and both bring very believable performances Maybe it was just my emotional state but I did find myself shedding a tear at the end of the film
The quality of this movie is simply unmatched by any baseball title of its time Pam Dixon branches out in the film industry to recruit blue chip prospects and make this work of art a must see Academy Award winners Brenda Fricker Home Alone Lost in New York A Time to Kill Ben Johnson The Last Picture Show Red Dawn and Adrien Brody The Pianist The Village amplify the atmosphere of the movie drawing in an anxious audience However the dramatic performances are neutralized by quirky radio broadcaster Jay O Sanders JFK The Day After Tomorrow br br The story is centralized around a foster child up and coming actor Joseph Gordon Levitt Brick The Lookout Sidekick Milton Davis Jr delivers a tear jerking performance as the longtime friend who never knew his parents The two don t have much but what they do have Angels baseball and what they are seeking identity That s when 4 time Emmy Nominee Danny Glover Lethal Weapon Predator 2 comes in to save the day as frustrated Angels Manager George Knox In relation all characters in the story seem to have the same mission search within themselves to find out who they really are br br Depressed over the fact that Roger JGL is separated from his father he wishes to God for reunification if the Angels can take the pennant Odds are astronomical but 3 time Emmy winner Christopher Lloyd Back to the Future My Favorite Martian comes in as the omniscient overseer to work a little magic pun Before you know it Al Lloyd is sitting with Roger in the stands snacking on cracker jacks and causing some of baseball s biggest boners Dorothy Kingsley and George Wells DK Oscar Nominee GW Oscar Winner 1951 screenplay is done justice under the finger of mastermind William Dear nominated in Directors Guild of America He includes a touching side story centered around pitcher Mel Clark played by Tony Danza 4 time Golden Globe nominee Emmy nominee who in relation to all other cast members is just trying to find his place in a confused Anaheim Clark has been dubbed a wash up a once big name in Cinci but he has something to prove to Manager Knox br br Spoiling this nail biting plot would simply be the equivalent to committing adultery in the 18th century This one is a diamond in the rough and it will keep you on the edge of the seat until all come to peace Did I mention a cameo by Matthew McConaughey A Time to Kill We Are Marshall for all you ladies out there
I have to say despite it s reviews Angels in the Outfield was a pretty good movie I like the fact how it teaches kids to always have faith and never give up because yes miracles can happen Unlike the other baseball movies this one particular movie stood out because of hits amazing special effects and well orchestrated soundtrack which was very interesting Though I liked this movie it did have some flaws such as some irrelevancy i e Towards the end when Ray Mitchell hits a homer he doesn t step on the plate and therefore that wouldn t be a score But that s just nitpicking I have to say i was really impressed with this movie s presence and moral Just have faith Don t give up
This movie while seemingly based off of a movie of the same title in 1951 released by MGM and starring Janet Leigh is still a great film Danny Glover in one of his best performances brings George Knox a down on his luck baseball manager with a short temper to life As for this movie being stacked how about adding Christopher Lloyd his stage experience works and shows through in his performances on screen a wonderful actor Joseph Gordon Levitt Third Rock from the Sun Brenda Fricker a charming and well seasoned Irish actress Tony Danza yes even he is good in this film Matthew McConaughey he stole the show in Dazed and Confused and his role may not be as pivotal in this film but he got exposure Adrien Brody what I said about Matthew McConaughey goes the same for Adrien except the Dazed and Confused part some great character actors like Taylor Negron David Tony Longo Messmer Jay O Sanders Ranch Wilder Neal McDonough Whitt Bass and a seasoned veteran in one of his final performances Ben Johnson Hank Murphy the owner of the California Angels and the rest of the cast does a great job plus a great storyline that is uplifting to pretty much anyone I don t care what recesses of depression you re in I loved this film as a kid and it brings back memories when I watch it today I need this on DVD I recommend it to any parent who s looking for something their kids have not seen and everybody else for that matter
One piece of trivia that is often forgotten about this family film is one of business br br At the time in 1994 this movie held the record for the biggest movie premiere in motion picture history and may continue to hold It was held in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania no doubt in honor of the original film s Angels who haunted the Pittsburgh Pirates In this remake they haunt the California Angels br br Anyway the premiere was held at the long gone Three Rivers Stadium which was the home of the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Pittsburgh Steelers at the time the Pirates are now housed in PNC Park and the Steelers at Heinz Field The premiere was held on a movie screen that was five stories in height inside the stadium and held and may even continue to hold the record for the largest movie premiere in history shown to 60 000 fans Danny Glover Tony Danza and Christopher Lloyd were all in attendance to the admiration of thousands of sports fans
This film was pretty good I am not too big a fan of baseball but this is a movie that was made to help understand the meaning of love determination heart etc br br Danny Glover Joseph Gordon Levitt Brenda Fricker Christopher Lloyd Tony Danza and Milton Davis Jr are brought in with a variety of talented actors and understanding of the sport The plot was believable and I love the message William Dear and the guys put together a great movie br br Most sports films revolve around true stories or events and they often do not work well But this film hits a 10 on the perfectness scale even though there were a few minor mistakes here and there br br 10 10
This was a top notch movie with a top notch cast Danny Glover Tony Danza Joseph Gordon Levitt and especially Christopher Lloyed are well cast in this charming movie about real life angels helping the Angels baseball team You never know it could happen I loved Lloyd s role in it He was hilarious The story is about turning your life around as the kid s belief in Angels helped turn around angry hardened and embittered manager Glover see the best in people The movie was well made and also about seeing the best in people and reaching your dreams It was funny charming touching and sad all very nicely done You will like or love it I guarantee br br out of
I saw this film on TV many years ago and I saw this film when I got this on tape I thought that this was reasonably well done It was not the best of all movies but it was good enough The movie has enough talent to inspire many people especially younger kids The acting was good with Danny Glover leading the cast The plot line was not very believable but the script was well written This movie can also be the interest of avid baseball fans It does not directly apply to a action packed sports movie It directly applies to a nice film that you can watch with your family and learn some messages that are hidden in this film Overall the film was good but not great I give this a movie a 7 10
I think this is a lovely family movie There are plenty of hilarious scenes and heart warming moments to be had throughout the movie The actors are great and the effects well executed throughout Danny Glover plays George Knox who manages the terrible baseball team The Angels and is great throughout the film Also fantastic are the young actors Joseph Gordon Levitt and Milton Davis Jr Christopher Lloyd is good as Al The Angel and the effects are great in this top notch Disney movie A touching and heart warming movie which everyone should enjoy
At first you think another Disney movie it might be good but it s a kids movie But when you watch it you can t help but enjoy it All ages will love this movie I first saw this movie when I was 10 and now 8 years later I still love it Danny Glover is superb and could not play the part any better Christopher Lloyd is hilarious and is perfect for the part Tony Danza is so believable as Mel Clark You can t help but to enjoy this movie I give it a 10 10
Although I don t usually go for relentlessly heartwarming fare like this I happened to catch the 1994 version of ANGELS IN THE OUTFIELD AitO on cable one Saturday morning just as it was starting Being an Adrien Brody fan I was curious to see what Brody was like as a youth of 21 20 when he filmed it I suppose in this early role as Danny Hemmerling utility infielder for the California Angels in the 1951 original the hard luck baseball team was the Pittsburgh Pirates The name change is a nice touch since it turns the title into wordplay I decided to give the flick a chance and it turned out to be a pretty painless even amiable experience with a decent balance of laughs tears sweetness and baseball based excitement Also my 7 year old daughter liked the angel effects Directed by Mike Nesmith s frequent collaborator William Dear AitO is the story of Roger Joseph Gordon Levitt a foster child who prays real hard after his ne er do well dad the convincingly sleazy Dermot Mulroney sarcastically says they ll be a family again once the last place California Angels win the pennant Soon Roger starts seeing real angels at the Angels games led by Christopher Lloyd whose usual zany eccentric irreverence keeps AitO from plummeting irretrievably into The Schmaltz Zone Crusty manager George Knox Danny Glover in world weary exasperated mode is a hard sell but once the team starts winning he believes Roger s angel sightings and soon Knox has Roger and his cute li l pal and fellow foster kid J P the adorable Milton Davis Jr at every Angels game for good luck Knox even starts toning down his own temperamental outbursts and profane language as much to appease the angels as for the kids sake resulting in a funny bit when he starts dressing down an umpire in his usual way but starts editing himself as he goes along Predictable obstacles ensue such as obnoxious sportcaster Ranch Wilder Jay O Sanders trying to make trouble for Knox because of the angel angle Sure it all works out fine for our heroes in the end but they re so darn amiable you don t mind Baby faced Brody has a couple of good lines I especially like his exchange with Glover about the emotional impact of the National Anthem at a ballgame as well as a cute bit where a pretty blonde angel massages his shoulders before he goes up to bat Brody isn t the only future star in AitO s lineup his teammates include Matthew McConaughey and Neal McDonough and of course young Gordon Levitt went on to co star in TV s 3rd ROCK FROM THE SUN as well as such films as 10 THINGS I HATE ABOUT YOU The always amusing Taylor Negron and Oscar winners but not for this film Brenda Fricker and Ben Johnson lend able support If you re a baseball fan who wants to rent a movie appropriate for the kids and check out some notable young actors before they became stars AitO 94 will do nicely
I really enjoyed this movie as a young kid At that age I thought that the silly baseball antics were funny and that the movie was cool because of it s about sports Now several years later I can look back and see what a well designed movie this was This movie opened my eyes as a small child to the struggles other children dealt with and real world issues That kind of exposure is largely lacking in kids movies these days which I don t think is to our society s benefit Sure the baseball antics seem really dumb now but they drew kids in No seven year old is going to ask to see a movie about foster children but they will ask to see a movie about baseball Disney realized this fact and took advantage of it to teach these children an important lesson about the world br br As a young adult the performance of Al and the other angels seems far less impressive however I will give credit to the actors playing both children and Danny Glover who all did a fantastic job
That was definitely the case with Angels in the Outfield It was on TV last night and I believe I hadn t seen the film since my sophomore year in high school and I m now in my 4th year of college Although the film has many flaws it is just so touching that you can t help but sit down watch it and enjoy yourself It is also hilarious Danny Glover s ranting is just so over the top that you can t help but laugh out loud at him at most time It adds to the film and I m sure it s exactly what the director wanted You actually feel for the characters in the film even though the development isn t the best A must see I highly recommend br br 8 10
I enjoy movies like this for their spirit no pun intended Its a decent clean movie about a baseball team that s falling behind and a young fan wishes for them to win since his deadbeat dad said that was the only way he d come back for him br br The spirit shines through in two ways A funny cast with Danny Glover and a young Joseph Gordon Levitt and the heavenly herald Al taking the dynamic form of Christopher Lloyd Its an energetic movie It gets you smiling and really involves you in the sport br br Therein lies my gripe the one thing that kinda bugs me is these sports movies that kind of turn you into an unexpecting fan for the team There s absolutely nothing wrong with that I just find it odd that I should come away from the movie thinking the Angels are a strong cool team when really my base loyalty such as it is lies with the Toronto Blue Jays It s interesting really If it s just a movie about an underdog kids team then its okay
I have always like this great baseball movie It has a good cast including two tremendous actors and two of My favorites Danny Glover and Christopher Lloyd Also in this movie is Ben Johnson Brenda Fricker Big Tony Longo Tony Danza and Matthew McConaughey Also Jay O Sanders and Dermot Mulroney The film has great special effects and acting from all of the film s actors The baseball scenes are all realistic The music by composer Randy Edelman is very good and it fits the film very well Some of the actors who reminded Me the actual baseball personalities Stoney Jackson s Ray Mitchell character reminded Me Royce Clayton McConaughey s character reminded Me of Steve Finley and Jay O Sanders s commentator in My opinion resembled how Al Hrabosky looks today This is a fantastic movie for non and Baseball fans and I strongly recommend this film
As a baseball die hard this movie goes contrary to what I expect in a sports movie authentic looking sports action believable characters and an original story line While Angels in the Outfield fails miserably in the first category it succeeds beautifully in the latter two Angels weaves the story of Roger and J P two Anaheim foster kids in love with baseball but searching for a family with that of the woebegone Angels franchise struggling to draw fans and win games Pushed by his deadbeat father s promise that they would be a family only when the Angels win the pennant Roger asks for some heavenly help and gets it in the form of diamond dwelling spirits bent on reversing the franchise s downward spiral And when short fused manager George Knox portrayed by Danny Glover begins believing in what Roger sees the team suddenly has hope for turning their season around and Roger and J P find something to believe in Glover in particular gives a nice performance and Tony Danza playing a washed up pitcher also does well despite clearly having ZERO idea of how to pitch out of the windup
They re not jawing journalists Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell from His Girl Friday or witty detective William Powell and sassy lady Myrna Loy from Thin Man but Woody Allen and Scarlett Johansson are surprisingly charming as amateur sleuths in Scoop Their screwball repartee is more postmodern than post Depression Allen s writing filled with ironic self deprecation and plain old New York angst Shades of the old wit occur rarely such as when he as Sid the Great Splendini magician responds about his background I was born into the Hebrew persuasion but when I got older I converted to narcissism Johansson fresh from Allen s Match Point as a bad girl here gets to be a relatively good sometimes ditsy journalism student caught in a murder mystery suitable for London a serial killer The plot is a reworking of his recent London based thriller Match Point right down to the upper class sins and the American Tragedy Place in the Sun boating accident As a matter of fact Allen is reworking Manhattan Murder Mystery and Purple Rose of Cairo to name just a couple of other examples I care not if he reworks I would like the new material to be at least the equal of the originals and alas it is just a reflection of his younger greatness br br Allen as director and actor can t hide his love for the actress as he couldn t for Diane Keaton and therefore takes a middling comedy into an appropriate place down the Allen canon not great but amusing at times brilliantly satirical About the suspected upper class murderer Sid Allen quips I d be very surprised if he killed one person This is vintage Allen humor While there are barely any bright literary allusions as in most of his film he lards Scoop with music from Grieg Tchaikovsky and Strauss to let us know the Woodman has not lost his touch of class
In the funeral of the famous British journalist Joe Strombel Ian McShane his colleagues and friends recall how obstinate he was while seeking for a scoop Meanwhile the deceased Joe discloses the identity of the tarot card serial killer of London He cheats the Reaper and appears to the American student of journalism Sondra Pransky Scarlett Johansson who is on the stage in the middle of a magic show of the magician Sidney Waterman Woody Allen in London and tells her that the murderer is the aristocrat Peter Lyman Hugh Jackman Sondra drags Sid in her investigation seeking for evidences that Peter is the killer However she falls in love with him and questions if Joe Strombel is right in his scoop br br Scoop is another great Woody Allen s comedy outside Manhattan actually again in London His ironic and witty lines are simply fantastic and I laughed a lot inclusive with his fate of hero in a country where people drive in the wrong side Sid Waterman is extremely funny and Woody Allen is in an excellent shape as comedian However his present muse Scarlett Johansson of whom I am a big fan has over acting and is annoying in many moments changing inclusive her accent to a histrionic pronunciation Her character is absolutely silly and promiscuous and I was quite disappointed with her performance probably for the first time in her filmography But this supernatural comedy is still a hilarious and worthwhile entertainment My vote is eight br br Title Brazil Scoop O Grande Furo Scoop The Big Scoop
I am a huge Woody Allen fan and so when I saw that this was playing at the cinema I couldn t help myself I wanted to see how Allen would follow up his magnificent film Match Point seeing as this is another one of his films shot in G B which is unique among Allen s work along with what seems to be his new muse Scarlett Johanson Scoop is much lighter than MP and the humor is Scoop s most enjoyable aspect The plot revolves around Johanson s character a journalism student who gets a tip on a hot story from beyond the grave She falls in love with a suspected serial killer Jackman and she must decide whether the truth is worth finding Oh and all of this is done with the help of a bumbling magician turned detective played by Allen br br I must say that I thoroughly enjoyed Johanson s performance but I am a bit bias I could watch a three hour film with Johanson in ever frame and remain enchanted She plays a ditsy yappy bumbling sweetheart that is kind of a variation in a sense of Allen s stereotypical neurosis stricken character She adds appropriate body language for comic effect Needless to say almost anyone who sees this will find Johanson s character sickeningly cute and that is a plus br br Allen is Allen He is still playing the same character much like Chaplin and his Little Tramp character Something that occur in this film makes me wonder if I will see the neurotic little hypochondriac again however He is not in the cast of his next picture and has been spending more time exclusively behind the camera as of late br br Jackman is also enjoyable as the suave millionaire murder suspect I cannot say that Jackman does anything in particular to make the role his but he suits his character none the less br br In terms of the plot I cannot help but feel that this is fresh In fact it stinks of Curse of the Jade Scorpion Johanson and Allen are more detective like than anything However I must applaud Allen on his ending because it is a bit more clever than your typical unoutstanding Hollywood version of this film Instead of everything being black and white things are painted in shades of gray Being entirely innocent has nothing to do with it nor does unequivocal guilt Though the plot seemed old Woody still has a knack for one liners I did find his allusions to his last film interesting Come for the humor laugh and be merry br br Needless to say if you enjoy Allen s work watch it If not watch something else
I was going to give it an 8 but since you people made 6 5 out of a lot better votes I had to up my contribution The river Styx was pure genius Sure Woody was his perennial stuff but at least his role was appropriate The first half hour was really hilarious and then the rest of the movie was easy to watch The dialog was clever enough and Woody s card tricks at the parties along with the reaction from the upper crust were fun to watch This was much better than the newspaper critics made it sound out to be And a plus a little Sorcerer s Apprentice to go along with it And of course did you notice that Johansen is getting a bit frumpy Charles Dance is always entertaining as was Hugh Jackman
do you still love woody allen s humor and sense of the absurd do you wait patiently for movies that get the plot going in the first five minutes instead of making you wait around if so you will adore this comedic murder mystery it has all the elements of a good mystery sharp plot a handsome suspect romance and intrigue mixed together with enough laughs and winks at fate to keep even the most jaded of movie goers happy br br with beautiful people and gorgeous homes and landscapes to ogle this frothy movie is just the thing to take your minds off your troubles as woody might say what s not to like
1 2 Scarlett Johansson Woody Allen Hugh Jackman Ian McShane Romola Garia Directed by Woody Allen Just after his work with Johansson on Match Point the two return for Scoop a Corky zany and fun comic ride When a student reporter Johansson finds out a new scoop from a deceased reporter McShane when she enters the materializer of a lame magician Allen The scoop being of the new Tarot Card killer in London who might be preppy Peter Lyman Jackman while Sondra and Sid are playing detective Sondra falls in love for the handsome would be killer Allen has finally hit a mark not as good as Match Point but definitely more fun I laughed a lot more than I expected one of the years must sees
Simply well written directed and acted Woody s best of the 2000 s if not his best since the 80 s Hugh Jackman was the perfect pick for his roll Scarlett Johansson s banter with Woody proves how well rounded an actress she has become br br It s refreshing to not being in a romance on screen with the leading lady He plays the perfect bumbling magician br br There have been a few reviews maligning this movie Don t let them stop you from seeing the wonderfully done film People in the crowd I saw this with were laughing so loud at some lines i missed the next line If you like Woody Allen films of the 70 s you ll regret missing this one br br I suggest you go to watch this film with an open mind if you do you might walk out smiling
Match Point and now Scoop have both convinced me that not only is Woody Allen doing a neat job making movies in England and that Scarlett Johansson is the right cast member but corroborated what I have known for years he shouldn t focus on neurotic rich New Yorkers In this case Johansson plays journalism student Sondra Pransky whom magician Sid Waterman Allen puts in his disappearing box where she meets the ghost of murdered reporter Joe Strombel Ian McShane who tells her that the serial killings that have plagued London were committed by millionaire Peter Lyman Hugh Jackman So she gets to know him and well I don t know how much I can tell you without giving it away But I can say that this is probably Allen s funniest movie in years There s his ubiquitous unique style of humor especially the line about his religion br br So you re sure to like this movie If nothing else it ll make you fall in love with London But mostly it s just so damn hilarious Even if you don t like Woody Allen you gotta love this one
Woody Allen s second movie set in London Tha Tarot Card murderer is killing prostitutes in London Aspiring journalist Sondra Pransky Scarlett Johansson gets a tip that he may be Lord Peter Lyman Hugh Jackman She starts to romance him but quickly falls in love She s helped by stage magician Sid Waterman Woody Allen who doesn t like what he sees br br I like this better than the over rated Match Point from last year It was shorter and moved much more quickly The plot is old but I was entertained and it kept me guessing till the very end It s not really a comedy but a mystery with a few very good comedic lines all from Allen of course It s not one of Allen s best but it s far better than his worst br br The acting is for the most part very good Allen is bad but he s played this character a million times before and it s gotten tiresome But Johansson and Jackman are just great they look fantastic and give two very appealing believable performances Also Allen surprisingly works on their sex appeal there is a sequence where they re both in the their bathing suits to show off their nice bodies The only real debit is that Allen still seems unsure on how to shot London He s not as off as he was on Match Point though maybe he ll just get better as he goes along br br Worth seeing I give it an 8
I went into this movie knowing nothing about it and ended up really enjoying it It lacked authenticity and believability Some of the things that the characters said and did were completely bizarre and a lot of the script seemed like it was ad libbed perhaps this is typical of Woody Allen Excuse my ignorance but the whole audience in the theater was laughing so hard It wasn t even at the jokes in the movie per se but at the whole movie itself The acting reminded me of Seinfeld s acting where he tries not to laugh at his own jokes they are corny but if you don t take the movie too seriously you can really appreciate the humour of the ACTORS not the CHARACTERS If you re looking for a random movie and you like Woody Allen I d definitely recommend it
Something happens to Sondra Pransky when she enters the magician s box on the stage of a London theater Little does Sondra know the spirit of newly departed journalist Joe Strombel materializes to ask her to investigate the man someone has told him on his voyage to another dimension is the infamous Tarot killer that has been on a binge of crime in London The only problem is the man accused is for all appearances a respectable upper class man br br When Sondra tells her experience to the Great Splendini who is a k a Sid Waterman the magician is stunned but decides to go along The two would be P I s conjure an invitation to a club where Peter Lyman goes to swim Sondra who fakes she is drowning catches the attention of this hunk who wants to see more of her br br Needless to say the two of them will get into all kinds of funny situations until the mystery is revealed at the end of the film Little does the real Tarot killer think he can fool a resolute Sondra who proves herself to be more resourceful than he gave her credit for br br The result is a perfect summer film with a lot of laughs that is just what one needs to get out of the heat into a perfect time in a cool theater Woody Allen has done better and yet this sunny comedy will vindicate him for past failures In Scoop Mr Allen has taken himself from the romantic lead pawing his gorgeous leading lady His trade mark gesticulating is something this funny man will never get rid of since it appears to be his trade mark The film has some funny one liners that will go over the head of the viewers that might not be paying attention br br Scarlett Johansson the beautiful star of Scoop seems to be the perfect foil for Woody Allen She plays the straight part while Mr Allen does his shtick a perfect combination Both are excellent in their banter throughout the film Ms Johansson is a knockout beauty in her red bathing suit although they have dressed her so dowdy in most of the costumes she wears on the screen Hugh Jackman is seen as Peter Lyman a sophisticated man about town with the right pedigree He makes a good appearance in the movie as the man pursuing Ms Johansson Ian McShane plays the dead Fleet Street journalist on his way to eternity br br Scoop is a light film for the hot and humid summer thanks to Woody Allen
Scoop out of Woody Allen is definitely not my favorite director but I enjoyed Match Point It was an excellent dark romantic thriller that luckily did not star Woody Allen It did have the beautiful Scarlett Johansson in it br br Scoop is Woody Allen s latest film and though he appears in this one it s OK It also features Scarlett Johansson and the two of them work perfect together br br Johansson plays Sondra Pransky a young college journalist who gets the scoop of a life time from the ghost of Joe Strombel Ian McShane Joe heard the scoop while on a boat with the grim reaper and a bunch of other souls the Reaper has taken One of those souls is the secretary of Peter Lyman Hugh Jackman She tells Joe that Peter may be the serial killer roaming the streets of England Joe with the scoop of a life time travels back to the living and gives this info to Sondra during a magic act Sondra is at some magic show with Magician Sid Waterman Woody Allen She becomes a volunteer to go in a disappearing box and while she is in the box she gets the visit from Joe Not knowing what to do she enlists the help of Sid Waterman to help her crack the case br br This film has a nice light hearted feel to it compared to Match Point and yet it all works Johansson and Allen work great together Allen s humor fits perfect for this story and role Hugh Jackman is terrific as Peter Layman the suspected serial killer br br This is a fun little movie to see if your ever looking for one to watch The cast ensemble works well together and the story flows and you sometimes forget that your watching Woody Allen be himself I say give it a chance because you just might like it
Coming immediately on the heels of Match Point 2005 a fine if somewhat self repetitive piece of serious Woody Scoop gives new hope to Allen s small but die hard band of followers among whom I number myself that the master has once again found his form A string of disappointing efforts culminating in the dreary Melinda and Melinda 2004 and the embarrassing Anything Else 2003 raised serious doubts that another first rate Woody comedy with or without his own participation as an actor was in the cards Happily the cards turn out to be a Tarot deck that serves as Scoop s clever Maguffin and proffers an optimistic reading for the future of Woody Allen comedy br br Even more encouraging Woody s self casting sadly one of the weakest elements of his films in recent years is here an inspired bit of self parody as well as a humble recognition at last that he can no longer play romantic leads with women young enough to be his daughters or granddaughters In Scoop Allen astutely assigns himself the role of Sid Waterman an aging magician with cheap tricks and tired stage patter who much like Woody himself has brought his act to London where audiences if not more receptive are at least more polite Like Chaplin s Calvero in Limelight 1952 Sid Waterman affords Allen the opportunity to don the slightly distorted mask of an artist whose art has declined and whose audience is no longer large or appreciative Moreover because they seem in character Allen s ticks and prolonged stammers are less distracting here than they have been in some time br br Waterman s character also functions neatly in the plot His fake magic body dissolving box becomes the ironically plausible location for visitations from Joe Strombel Ian McShane a notorious journalistic muckraker and recent cardiac arrest victim Introduced on a River Styx ferryboat to Hades Strombel repeatedly jumps ship because he just can t rest in eternity without communicating one last scoop about the identity of the notorious Tarot killer Unfortunately his initial return from the dead leads him to Waterman s magic show and the only conduit for his hot lead turns out to be a journalism undergraduate Sondra Pransky Scarlett Johansson who has been called up from the audience as a comic butt for the magician s climactic trick Sondra enthusiastically seizes the journalistic opportunity and drags the reluctant Waterman into the investigation to play the role of her millionaire father As demonstrated in Lost in Translation Johansson has a talent for comedy and the querulous by play between her and Allen is very amusing and all the more so for never threatening to become a prelude to romance br br Scoop s serial killer plot involving grisly murders of prostitutes and an aristocratic chief suspect Peter Lyman Hugh Jackman is the no doubt predictable result of Allen s lengthy sabbatical exposure to London s ubiquitous Jack the Ripper landmarks and lore Yet other facets of Scoop as of Match Point also derive from Woody s late life encounter with English culture Its class structure manners idiom dress architecture and yes peculiar driving habits give Woody fresh new material for wry observation of human behavior as well as sharp social satire When for instance Sondra is trying to ingratiate herself with Peter Lyman at a ritzy private club Waterman observes from his point of view we re scum A good deal of humor is also generated by the contretemps of stiffly reserved British social manners encountering Waterman s insistent Borscht belt Jewish plebeianism And then of course there is Waterman s hilarious exit in a Smart Car he can t remember to drive on the left side of the road br br As usual Allen s humor in Scoop includes heavy doses of in jokes taking the form of sly allusions to film and literary sources as well as increasingly references to his own filmography In addition to the pervasive Jack the Ripper references for instance the film s soundtrack is dominated by an arrangement of Grieg s The Hall of the Mountain King compulsively whistled by Hans Beckert in M the first masterpiece of the serial killer genre The post funeral gathering of journalists who discuss the exploits of newly departed Joe Strombel clearly mimics the opening of Broadway Danny Rose 1984 References to Deconstructing Harry 1997 include the use of Death as a character along with his peculiar voice and costume the use of Mandelbaum as a character name and the mention of Adair University Harry s alma mater and where Sondra is now a student Moreover the systematic use of Greek mythology in the underworld river cruise to Hades recalls the use of Greek gods and a Chorus in Mighty Aphrodite 1995 br br As to quotable gags Allen s scripts rely less on one liners than they did earlier in his career but Scoop does provides at least a couple of memorable ones To a question about his religion Waterman answers I was born in the Hebrew persuasion but later I converted to narcissism And Sondra snaps off this put down of Waterman s wannabe crime detecting If we put our heads together you ll hear a hollow noise All in all Scoop is by far Woody Allen s most satisfying comedy in a decade
Great movie enough laughs and action for any audience br br Since the last person who posted on this movie took it upon themselves to call Woody Allen incestuous and not comment on the film here I am br br The film follows an unlikely duo Johansson and Allen as they follow a tip given to them by the ghost of a recently deceased English reporter Their search takes them into the home of the killer and eventually to a somewhat tragic end But don t let the plot fool you the film truly is hilarious and the acting is superb br br It seems that as directors reach a certain age they really get things right Clint Eastwood Allen and Pollack all seem to making some of the most imaginative work of their respective careers Also from watching the movie in a pact theater you can just tell that people really love Woody Allen and are ready for him to really make a comeback The second he walked on screen audience lit up There s just something about the man and he really shines in Scoop br br Check it out it s worth the trip
Allow yourself to be transported to a different old school kind of storytelling Scoop is classic Woody Allen br br Allen s latest muse Scarlett Johansson who also appeared in last year s Match Point also by Allen is surprisingly able to tone down her sultry sex kitten appeal and transform into a normal looking student type with the aid of nerdish glasses and outfits but still fails to make the audience believe how Hugh Jackman s lordly character can be so smitten by her given the royal s background don t worry no spoilers here There are no grand transformations for Johansson s character here as she consistently plays the same character throughout despite the script saying otherwise You even forgive her character s apparent lack of logic continuing an affair with a suspected serial killer simply because he is His Royal Hotness Jackman who is refreshing to see sans the Wolverine duds br br If anything consistency is what the 70 year old Allen is all about He continues to tell his stories on celluloid in the same way he always has as if he s never been exposed to modern film making which is probably what makes his quiet simple films appealing They never seem to aim for a specific market as if Allen makes movies to his taste alone whether the public likes it or not
I d even say some shades of Hitchcock this is clearly better than MMM which is seen as a guilty pleasure by some if not most Woody fans By the way did you know that Annie Hall was first conceived as a murder mystery Anyhow Woody reclaims some relevance in film comedy with this one The plot turns are nice and tight I will say that in the first 20 minutes or so some of the actors are a little too hasty at delivering their lines but stick around Scarlett Johansson proves well cast in the Diane Keaton type role and at no time is there any uncomfortable moments between her and the much older Woody No one could imagine a more perfect actor for the role of Peter Lyman than Jackman
Great Woody Allen No Good Woody Allen Definitely I found myself along with the audience in attendance laughing hard and often at some of the best Woody Allen lines we ve heard in a while The aging Allen created an appropriate role for himself as Scarlett Johansson s father well sort of Some have said Johansson plays a young Dianne Keaton I beg to differ She plays Woody s dialogue which in his comedies always has a very similar feel like well a Woody Allen comedy That s fine for us Woody appreciators She certainly did Woody s dialogue far better than the young cast of his last comedy Melinda Melinda Some may find Woody s humor tiresome but for those of us who love it when it s done right we look forward to the next
First of all let me comment that the audience LOVED it from the first moment Perhaps current events in the Middle East led people to take the attitude I came for a comedy and by George I m going to enjoy it but for whatever reason everybody seemed really into the comedy of it The last few times Woody has tried to do a straight comedy Small Time Crooks Curse of the Jade Scorpion Hollywood Ending I ve felt like the one liners felt strained and a bit antiquated I remember thinking at one point That would have been funny in the early sixties So going in to this movie I was afraid Woody was becoming tone deaf however in this one his comic sensibilities were in perfect tune Admittedly there were plenty of my fellow AARP card carrying folks in the screening but there were also plenty of 20 somethings and 30 somethings as well and they all seemed to get it and give up the occasional belly laugh in addition to numerous guffaws chuckles and the like In many instances the throw aways had people laughing so loud you missed the next line br br Thematically Woody was traipsing familiar ground As I suspected from the trailer this film had a lot of Manhattan Murder Mystery in it but then again there was more than a smidgen of Oedipus Wrecks New York Stories Alice and even a little tribute to Broadway Danny Rose at the very beginning br br Even with Woody in the movie Scarlett as Sondra was at times the Woody proxy but her character was far from the Nebbish that say Will Ferrell gave us in Melinda and Melinda or Kenneth Branaugh attempted in Celebrity Instead of archetypal ticks and quirks Sondra s nerdishness comes directly from the family history which she shares early on On numerous occasions the family business leads her to malapropisms that we get as an audience while the characters on the screen can only perceive them as strange non sequiturs Since we are all in on the joke we can t help but laugh But the laughs don t come from recognizing the Woody nebbish but truly from the character To a great extent unlike Farrell Branaugh Cusack or even Mia Farrow before her Scarlett is not required to use the Woody voice to evoke the Woody role Thus we don t find ourselves ripped out of the narrative as a Woody s voice suddenly emerges from someone else face br br As my friend commented on the way out Sid the character played by Woody is a supporting role but more center stage than I was hoping going in However this time Woody seems to have written a character that truly fits his current persona Unlike his Ed Dobel sage character in Anything Else or his blind director in Hollywood Ending this time the character is a comfortable fit Perhaps more importantly this time the character works in the story Within the elevated circles they find themselves in he is even more fish out of water than Scarlett which is used to great comedic effect throughout Sid is a declining itinerant magician playing to small audiences but the fact that he is from another era is placed front and center for our enjoyment br br But what about Jackman What about Ian Swearengen McShane I liked both of them to the extent that they are used in the piece I particularly liked McShane s short but effective turns Jackman is charming with the ease of Old Money that was so often portrayed in films from 50 years ago Class echoes from Purple Rose of Cairo br br So what did I think Short answer maybe his best straight comedy since 1994 s Bullets Over Broadway Less stylized than Mighty Aphrodite Less caustic than Deconstructing Harry Less forced than Small Time Crooks or Hollywood Ending Woody has finally found a comic voice that works in the 21st century
Greetings again from the darkness Remember all the What happened to Woody Allen jokes Even Mr Allen poked fun at the fans who wanted him to continue making his same funny films As with any great artist Mr Allen s craft evolved over the years and he lost some fans while picking up others Last year s masterpiece Matchpoint showed he is still every bit as relevant and poignant as he was in the days of Annie Hall and Manhattan What is most striking to us 40 plus year fans is that Mr New York himself seems to have a bit of a crush on the mother country Apparently he actually likes England While filming Matchpoint Mr Allen became enamored with Scarlett Johansson and her real life spirit and sense of humor This attraction motivated him to write his best comedy in years Scarlett while risking overexposure must be given credit for not just picking films that cast her in some glamorous light She is unafraid to look and act like a real person In Scoop she flashes some real on screen comedy chops and in many scenes delivers the real punchline to Mr Allen s straight man Of course any time Mr Allen decides to put himself in front of the camera he will get more than his share of one liners and social commentaries in which is fine because few do it better br br Very nice support work from Ian McShane and Hugh Jackman In fact Mr Jackman provides a few glimpses into why many of us thought him the best choice to replace Brosnan as the new Bond As with most of Allen s films the star is the script not the actors Although Scarlett delivers superbly here and is a nice contrast to the polished Allen and Jackman what makes this one crackle is the dialogue especially the banter between Allen and Scarlett If you are not a huge Woody the actor fan fear not He does limit his screen time and he is quite effective except in two or three brief scenes that almost seem out of place Another Woodman tradition is a sparkling musical background and Scoop is no exception especially the Strauss composition br br Scoop is a nice cross between Annie Hall and the best of the Marx Brothers films or the Cary Grant comedies Yes it is an adult comedy but it is actually very cute especially for a serial killer and talking ghost comedy
Scoop is also the name of a late Thirties Evelyn Waugh novel and Woody Allen s new movie though set today has a nostalgic charm and simplicity It hasn t the depth of characterization intense performances suspense or shocking final frisson of Allen s penultimate effort Match Point argued by many including this reviewer to be a strong return to form but Scoop does closely resemble Allen s last outing in its focus on English aristocrats posh London flats murder and detection This time Woody leaves behind the arriviste murder mystery genre and returns to comedy and is himself back on the screen as an amiable vaudevillian a magician called Sid Waterman stage moniker The Great Splendini who counters some snobs probing with I used to be of the Hebrew persuasion but as I got older I converted to narcissism Following a revelation in the midst of Splendini s standard dematerializing act with Scarlett Johansson as Sondra Pransky the audience volunteer the mismatched pair get drawn into a dead ace English journalist s post mortem attempt to score one last top news story On the edge of the Styx Joe Strombel Ian McShane has just met the shade of one Lord Lyman s son s secretary who says she was poisoned and she s told him the charming aristocratic bounder son Peter Lyman Hugh Jackman was the Tarot Card murderer a London serial killer Sondra and Sid immediately become a pair of amateur sleuths With Sid s deadpan wit and Sondra s bumptious beauty they cut a quick swath through to the cream of the London aristocracy br br Woody isn t pawing his young heroine muse as in Match Point Johansson again as in the past This time moreover Scarlett s not an ambitious sexpot and would be movie star She s morphed surprisingly into a klutzy bespectacled but still pretty coed Sid and Sondra have no flirtation which is a great relief They simply team up more or less politely to carry out Strombel s wishes by befriending Lyman and watching him for clues to his guilt With only minimal protests Sid consents to appear as Sondra s dad Sondra who s captivated Peter by pretending to drown in his club pool re christens herself Jade Spence Mr Spence i e Woody keeps breaking cover by doing card tricks but he amuses dowagers with these and beats their husbands at poker spewing non stop one liners and all the while maintaining apparently with success that he s in oil and precious metals just as Jade has told him to say br br That s about all there is to it or all that can be told without spoiling the story by revealing its outcome At first Allen s decision to make Johansson a gauche naively plainspoken and badly dressed college girl seems not just unkind but an all around bad decision But Johansson who has pluck and panache as an actress miraculously manages to carry it off helped by Jackman an actor who knows how to make any actress appear desirable if he desires her The film actually creates a sense of relationships to make up for it limited range of characters Sid and Sondra spar in a friendly way and Peter and Sondra have a believable attraction even though it s artificial and tainted she is after all going to bed with a suspected homicidal maniac br br What palls a bit is Allen s again drooling over English wealth and class things his Brooklyn background seems to have left him despite all his celebrity with a irresistible hankering for Jackman is an impressive fellow glamorous and dashing His parents were English But could this athletic musical comedy star raised in Australia X Man s Wolverine really pass as an aristocrat Only in the movies perhaps here and in Kate and Leopold br br This isn t as strong a film as Match Point but to say it s a loser as some viewers have is quite wrong It has no more depth than a half hour radio drama or a TV show but Woody s jokes are far funnier and more original than you ll get in any such media affair and sometimes they show a return to the old wit and cleverness It doesn t matter if a movie is silly or slapdash when it s diverting summer entertainment On a hot day you don t want a heavy meal The whole thing deliciously evokes a time when movie comedies were really light escapist entertainment without crude jokes or bombastic effects without Vince Vaughan or Owen Wilson Critics are eager to tell you this is a return to the Allen decline that preceded Match Point Don t believe them He doesn t try too hard Why should he He may be 70 but verbally he s still light on his feet And his body moves pretty fast too
I thought this was a wonderful way to spend time on a too hot summer weekend sitting in the air conditioned theater and watching a light hearted comedy The plot is simplistic but the dialogue is witty and the characters are likable even the well bread suspected serial killer While some may be disappointed when they realize this is not Match Point 2 Risk Addiction I thought it was proof that Woody Allen is still fully in control of the style many of us have grown to love br br This was the most I d laughed at one of Woody s comedies in years dare I say a decade While I ve never been impressed with Scarlet Johanson in this she managed to tone down her sexy image and jumped right into a average but spirited young woman br br This may not be the crown jewel of his career but it was wittier than Devil Wears Prada and more interesting than Superman a great comedy to go see with friends
I was lucky enough to get a free pass to an advance screening of Scoop last night Full house at the theatre and when the movie ended there was spontaneous applause I didn t speak to anyone who disliked Scoop although two teenagers sitting next to me sighed and fidgeted uncomfortably for most of the film They were the exception though because everyone else including myself really enjoyed themselves br br Scoop is a quickly paced murder mystery A young female journalism student is unwittingly maneuvered by forces beyond her control into trying to catch a serial killer on the loose Plenty of hijinks ensue as she partners up with a traveling illusionist and falls in love with a frisky and charming young nobleman br br Scoop isn t a bad addition to the Woody Allen filmography It isn t his best work but it is a very enjoyable and light hearted romp I d say it fits quite comfortably into being an average Woody Allen film right in the middle of the pack If you re a Woody Allen fan you ll probably enjoy yourself If you re indifferent to his work then Scoop might be enough to get you interested in seeing more I don t think that anyone who dislikes his style of film making and acting are going to change their mind Woody plays the same kind of neurotic character we ve grown so accustomed to although it borders dangerously close to forced and over the top in this film While potentially aggravating for some who might find themselves wishing he d hurry up and just spit out the words Woody Allen fans know what to expect br br Very good performances all around in my opinion although I found myself missing Ian McShane who is excellent and not on camera nearly enough Hugh Jackman is great as the charming nobleman and I think Woody Allen has found a new regular star to work with in Scarlett Johansson I think that with Match Point this is their second pairing and she s just magic with the material that Woody gives her Could be the beginning of a beautiful relationship I m glad I saw the movie and definitely recommend it More sophisticated comedy than movies like Scary Movie 4 so if your brand of comedy is the latter rather than the former Scoop probably isn t for you If on the other hand you like a touch of class sophistication and fun Scoop is for you Probably not the Woody Allen film I d introduce to a newcomer but all others should give it a try
Scoop is easily Woody Allen s funniest film of the 2000 s so far Allen although finally looking his age is at the top of his game as low brow magician Sidney Waterman His one liners and demeanor are hilarious Don t let the critics sway your opinion Scoop is a top notch Woody Lite picture br br The classical music score is an excellent compliment to the action on screen Scarlett Johanson looks gorgeous in that bathing suit Jackman is dashing The cinematography glows Scoop is wonderful escapist fare from start to finish The last shot of the film alone is worth the admission price
I went to the movie theater this afternoon expecting to be underwhelmed by Scoop Happily the film exceeded expectations at least a little bit It s nothing heavy nothing deep and not anywhere as good as any number of real Allen masterpieces but it s also completely enjoyable as a light bantering comedy There s something kind of simple and sweet about it Cute was the word I heard from people in the audience as they were walking out after the show It doesn t feel like Allen set out to create a masterpiece here it feels like he wanted to make a little comedy and have fun doing it Compared to just about everything Hollywood is producing Allen s stuff has a tendency to charm Even the fluffy stuff These days it s just refreshing to go to a movie made by an actual human being
Reading a wide variety of Scoop reviews over the past few days I walked into the theater prepared for a subpar outing from Woody Happily I couldn t have been more wrong Granted Woody the performer is slowing down a touch or two but Woody the writer director is in fine form and found a credible way to integrate his 70 year old self into the story Judging from the laughter and guffaws the audience ate up Allen s one liners and dialogue in a way that I haven t seen in several years br br In a movie landscape dominated by software approved story arcs twentysomething tastes and assembly line formula fare for kiddies it s a source of both satisfaction and inspiration to see Allen pursuing his highly personal and still rewarding path
This is a excellent series You will laugh you will cry these wonderful people will be a part of your family The way this family cares for one another and helps each other through their crisis sets a great example of the way we should live our lives There are many good things they do and a number of bad choices but they never turn their backs on family they work through problems Michelle the youngest daughter is the cutest thing I ve seen Stephanie the middle daughter suffers with Middle Child Syndrome and with the help of EVERYONE in the family it s better DJ the oldest daughter is growing up whether her dad wants it to happen or not One thing they all share is they miss their mom Danny Dad Joey and Uncle Jesse love these kids so much and it s apparent in every episode
I don t know if this is a sitcom or not but I agree that this is one of the greatest television shows ever It s great that this show still airs And I love Michelle It s cute on the episodes when she was a baby and she talked and she sometimes said something funny Aw br br This show can relate to children and teens and well families as they struggle through rough times and try to work it out as a family I don t know who would ever turn down an opportunity to watch this show with someone br br I love the episode when I think her name is DD the older girl accidentally stole a sweatshirt and she learned a lesson about stealing That was a great episode An example that this TV show shows the family working things out as a family br br I recommend this show for everyone
Full House is a great show I am still today growing up on it I started watching it when i was 8 and now i am 12 and still watching it i fell in love with all of the characters especially Stephanie she is my favorite she had such a sense of humor in case there are people on this sight that hardly watch the show you should because you will get hooked on it i became hooked on it after the first show i saw which just happened to be the first episode in 2002 it really is a good show i really think that this show should go down to many generations in families and it s great too because it is an appropriate show for all ages and for all parents it teaches kids lessons on how to go on with their life nothing terrible happens like violence or swearing it is just a really great sit com i give it 5 out of 5 stars what do you think OH and the best time to watch it is when you are home sick from school or even the old office It will make you feel a lot better Trust me i am hardly home sick but i still know that it will make you feel better and to everybody that thinks the show is stupid well that s too bad for you because you won t get as far in life even if you are happy with your life you really should watch it and you will get hooked on it i am just telling you what happened to me and everybody else that started watching this awesome show well i need must go to have some lunch remember you must start watching full house and soon
I loved this show growing up and I still watch the first season DVD at age 19 today What can I say I grew up in a house much like the one on Full House I had a dad two sisters and a dog I guess the only difference was that I did not live with my uncle and my dad s best friend Also I grew up with my mom in the house I don t know what I would have done without Full House on television I think that Stephanie played by Jodie Sweetin D J played by Kirk Cameron s sister Candace and Michelle Played by Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen are my favorite characters I can relate to each of them because I am the middle child of my family like Steph I am a younger sister like Michelle and I am an older sister like D J I really like how the show always has moral values because I don t really like any of the O C like shows today I like the comedy of Full House too Uncle Jesse John Stamos Joey Dave Coulier and Danny Bob Saget are hilarious as the girls uncle dad s friend and dad respectively The story goes that after the girls mom dies Danny s best friend Joey and his brother in law Jesse move in to help raise the kids Three men trying to raise three young girls hilarious Each character on Full House is full of heart funny and genuinely believable Joey is an aspiring comedian with a kid s heart and soul Jesse is the cool motorcycle riding tough guy uncle who is softened by his three nieces and later his wife Becky Laurie Laughlin from Summerville Both kids and adults will love this show Guaranteed
Full House came to me when I was about 9 I remember seeing re runs of America s Funniest Home Videos with Bob Saget and one day my mom told me that he was also in a show called Full House One day I was lucky enough to catch an episode while visiting family It didn t seem too interesting at first but as I watched more and more ever night at 9 00 I would just be so into it br br This show really makes you want to be there yourself hang out with the girls go places with them and maybe even join in their little family sing alongs br br The thing I like most about Full House is that it s a great show for kids AND adults of all ages There will be some parts that are more for adults then parts that are meant for kids so that the whole family will enjoy it No matter how cheesy it can be it s still a great show and I would definitely recommend it to anyone br br 10 10
I think the comments regarding the show being cheesy are a bit too exaggerated When a person comes to watch a TV show what does he look out for It is to enjoy that he watches a show unless he she is a critic or a person who analyzes story But most of us are not so and watch the shows to relax and enjoy FULL HOUSE is an ideal show to watch after having a heavy day in the office school It makes you laugh and it is not just humor br br Yes the Tanner family is a perfect family a perfectly hypothetical family If any such family existed in real world it would be a role model for us to follow But this is a TV show and not a real family and there is nothing wrong in depicting a hypothetical family on television The very fact that the show could run so long shows us that people enjoyed watching it whatever be the comments later on br br Another good point about the show is that any person of any age would not only enjoy watching it but would take back a message however childish that message be Those Jesse s talks with Michelle are extremely touching if one doesn t think of it as childish br br Overall I would say after watching every show of Full House there is a contentment in your heart that is rarely present after many other shows
I grew up watching Full House as a child I stopped watching it for years but about two weeks ago I started back watching it again Now my kids watch the show and they love to watch it as well My kids can t believe that DJ on the show and I are the same age br br I really love the show because it is a show you can watch with your family It has good teachings your kids can learn from Also there isn t any drugs and violence on it Also when the kids on the show have a problem they can always open up to their family for help That s the message kids should be getting from TV now a days turn to your family for help not to drugs Kids should be watching more shows like Full House instead of half the mess on TV now a days br br I also love the show because it makes you laugh and it is down to earth It talks about real life problems and family matters There is always a lesson you can learn from the show br br I vote the show a 10
Full House is a wonderful sitcom that is about a dad Danny Tanner whose wife had just died in a car crash So Danny asks his brother in law Jesse Katsopolis and best friend Joey Gladstone to help raise his three girls Donna Jo DJ Tanner Stephanie Tanner and Michelle Tanner This is my favorite show ever and I can watch it all day long And something on Full House is always making me laugh and there are sad parts also There is never a dull moment in Full House The main characters are played by Bob Saget Danny Tanner John Stamos Jesse Katsopolis Dave Coulier Joey Gladstone Candace Cameron DJ Tanner Jodie Sweetin Stephanie Tanner and Mary Kate Ashley Olsen Michelle Tanner
i really did not watch this show as often when i was a child but the first episode i remember ever seeing is the episode where Kimmy Gibbler pierced Stephanie ears when i started high school back in 2000 i had problems all through out high school and i d rather not get into that but i used to always watch saved by the bell but that show really reminded me of the problems i faced at school and it rarely showed the kids parents saved by the bell is okay but not a good family show a few days after i graduated high school in 2004 i turned the TV to the family channel and day after day i got addicted to full house i could even push the info button and see the year it came out and i would remember what i was doing during that time period the episode was about to come on and it was titled birthday blues and to this day it is most favorite episode it s sad with a happy ending and you see Kimmy Gibbler in a way she doesn t act in other episodes she actually shows her serious side i have seasons 1 2 3 4 5 and 6 on DVD and i am waiting for 7 and 8 i wished somehow they could have a documentary and some commentaries from the cast members i don t why some people have a hatred for this show because you don t see trash and violence on this show and for those who hate this show i pray for you because you might have grown up in a dysfunctional family where there was no love but full house in my opinion is a family living in heaven where everyone is happy and good things always happen and the characters are so awesome Danny Tanner reminds me of my mother and grandmother Joey is good natured and is always in a good mood when i was a child i used to be just like Jesse and he is the first actor on TV as a guy that is so obsessed with hair somehow you can actually tell that DJ is a California girl i really like the episodes with Kimmy Gibbler because she always makes me smile and brightens my day when i watch her and Stephanie is so cool also i have a hard time telling the Olsen twins apart i want my kids to watch it one day but full house is my 1 favorite show and Sabrina the teenage witch is my 2 favorite one day sometime before i die i would really like to meet all the cast of full house in person the first 3 seasons are kinda boring but they start getting better in the 4th season i just wished they could have made a 9th season they stopped making full house in 1995 and in the fall of 1996 Sabrina the teenage witch came out which is a similar family show but full house is a very loving show and they have their good times and bad times and yes i understand if your a wild trashy type person your going to hate this show but this is a show for happiness and it is also moral show also i would like to say that the first 3 seasons is good kid shows but around the 4th and 5th seasons DJ and Stephanie become teenagers also i noticed not only with full house but a lot of shows they never talk about the problems in the world and politics like when full house was on the air during the gulf war in 1991 and during the time of the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995 they never mention anything about it also steve was my favorite DJ s boyfriend the ones with viper and nelson were nt very interesting but season 5 and 6 i think are the best i just wished they would have made a 9th season because it left a big question mark in my head because on the last episode in the last minute dj gets a surprise and goes to her prom with her ex boyfriend steve i always wondered if they got back together and i liked how in the final seasons DJ was always the responisible one and stephanie was always wanting to do something daring like in the episode stephanie s wild ride
Full House is a great family show However after watching some episodes over and over again I ve realized that they re incredibly boring and they seem to shelter themselves from the outside world a lot Yes there is a lot of comedy but there are times when it s incredibly cheesy It s not like I hate it but just don t watch them over and over again because they get old quick Probably the best season is the first br br Full House is about widower Danny Tanner Bob Saget and his three daughters D J Candace Cameron Stephanie Jodie Sweetin and Michelle Mary Kate and Ashley When Danny s wife dies the he is in need of some help So his best friend Joey Dave Coulier and the girls Uncle Jesse John Stamos moves in with them Once they live there together they find they can t live without each other br br Full House reminds you just how important family is and that you can always go home again
This show is about three little girls D J Stephanie and Michelle Their Mother is killed by a drunk driver so their father Danny invites his Brother in law Jesse and his Old Friend Joey So the whole show is about living life The girls go through life s troubles and have life lessons They develop crushes boyfriends and many more The whole show is basically about to go with the flow You do not have to hold grudges you just have to let it go I think this show is really good and fun to watch I grew up watching this show and still watch it today I am glad they still air this show on television I watch it almost every day I rate it 10 10
OK Who brought the cheese I love it During it s run it became a phenomenon The Anorexic Twins became popular Bob Saget started making a paycheck Instead of his REALLY funny stand up And people knew who Dave Coulier was This is when life was good and simple This is one of the great American classics It was humorous and always brought home a good lesson And this is where I differ from the norm I liked the last few seasons Like Home Improvement when children get older there are a lot more you can do with the script This is why I dare say It could have gone much later than it did But anyway I gave it an 8 10 because of its wholesome funny story lines and because of Bob Saget
I love full house so much that i couldn t live without full house Why did it end It upsets a lot of the fan of it Can we have a Full House II Oh come on But it is better that we have those DVD to help us But i need those real ones to come up with another new episode Love Warmth are filled the house All the characters are very cute and handsome Candace Cameron Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen Jodie Sweetin Bob Saget Dave Coulier and John Stamos loooooooove you DJ Michelle Stephanie Danny Joey and Jesse please come back to the screen please How is Michelle after falling down from a horse How are Nicky and Alex Is Joey alone or is he having a wife or at least a girlfriend Are they still living in the same house I want to continue the life of full house and please don t upset me
I try to watch it everyday most of the time and even though I have watched it for the past 4 years I have not seen every episode br br The Show is about Danny Tanner who is guy who does news for sports His wife is killed by a car accident from a drunk driver and he asks Jesse an Elvis maniac with a motorcycle and has an obsession of his hair Joey an adult kid who does comedy and does voices of cartoons all the time to take care of his three girls Donna Joe they call her D J Stephinie who is the second oldest and Michelle the youngest br br They all live under one roof with no one to help them out br br Later in the show Jesse gets a girl friend and later is married to her and have twins Nicki and Alex this starts to happen in the new seasons This show is awesome if you like The Suite life of Zack and Cody That s so Raven Boy Meets world and Designing Woman you will love this It starts to get better in the ending seasons Watch it you will love it
Full House was and still is a great show It s a good show for people of all ages and is also a good family show There really aren t any shows like it anymore The kids are very cute and even though it s a bit cheesy it s still good especially for anyone who watched it when they were a kid I would love to see the cast interviewed now Anyone that would like to see interviews of the cast kind of like a where are they now type thing for the special features of the DVD should go to the Petition spot website and sign a petition titled Full House Reunion on DVD as there is a petition for this in hopes that the cast may want to do it Yay for Full House
FULL HOUSE in my opinion is an absolute ABC classic I m not sure if I ve never seen every episode but I still enjoyed it One of my favorite episodes is where Jesse John Stamos and Rebecca Lori Loughlin get married If you want to know how what made it so funny you d have to have seen it for yourself It was a two parter so you d have to have seen both parts Another one of my favorite episodes is where Jesse Stephanie Jodie Sweetin and Michelle Mary Kate Ashley Olsen get locked in a gas station on Michelle s birthday You d also have to have seen it for yourself if you want to know how and why that happened I have many other ones that I like too Everyone always gave a good performance the production design was spectacular the costumes were well designed and the writing was always very strong In conclusion even though it can be seen in syndication now I strongly recommend you catch it just in case it goes off the air for good
This is how I feel about the show br br I started watching the show in reruns in 2001 br br I enjoy the show but it had too many faults br br I HATE THE MICHELLE JOEY CHARACTERS br br Stealing story lines from old TV shows They even stole from The Partirdge Family Then in 1 episode The Partridge Family was mentioned br br Actors playing different roles in different episodes MTV Martha Quinn the most notable doing this especially when she played herself in 1 episode br br The Michelle character COULD NOT take a joke but then they had this little kid act out revenge to her sisters for a joke by them on her br br Story lines that came went in 1 episode Joey getting the TV show with Frankie Annette never heard from it again after that Danny all of a sudden playing the guitar 1 episode he is coaching soccer 1 episode he is coaching softball baseball 1 game you are out huh Danny br br Jesse Joey keep getting jobs REALLY QUICKLY with no experience Only in a TV show br br I did like the D J Stephanie characters Wish Jodie Sweetin could have learned from Candace Cameron Bure had a clean NON drug adult life
This show has a great storyline It s very believable A mans wife dies and he cant take care of his children alone so he calls on his brother in law his best friend and many others come later on in the show Such as Rebeecca Donaldson the lovable yet strong dog Comet Nikki and Alex who you can find out for yourself I don t want to spoil it for you and of coerce Kimmy Gibler The sidekick of DJ but the kids are wonderful too This is Mary Kate and Ashley first took off And also you may know Candace Cameron Bure from shows like St Elsewere Punky Brewster and that s so raven Jodie Sweetin plays Steph the love able middle child who feels left out Really this is a very good show
I have never seen a show as good as Full House Full House puts all of the newer shows to shame big time Anyone who has never seen it which I don t see how it is possible should see it It is a great show for anyone of any age Full House will make you laugh it will make you cry it will amaze you True some people feel that there are some cheesy aspects to the show but the positive aspects out weigh all of the cheesy aspects Full House ran it s first episode on September 22 1987 entitled Our Very First Show and ran it s last episode on May 23 1995 entitled Michelle Rides Again Part II br br The plot of the show is very believable Danny Tanner Bob Saget losses his wife Pam in an accident involving a drunk driver Danny has his brother in law Jesse Katsopolis John Stamos which is Pam s younger brother and Danny also brings in his best friend Joey Gladstone Dave Coulier to help him raise his three daughters Danny s daughters are named DJ Candice Cameron Bure Stephanie Jodie Sweetin and Michelle Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen Joey and Jesse plan on moving in with Danny and his three girls for a few months just to help out and end up living with them for eight years which is the number of years the show ran for br br The following is a short description of some of the characters and the actor actress who played him her John Stamos Jesse John Stamos is a great actor He plays Jesse Jesse is a rock star waiting to get his big break In Full House John Stamos does a great job portraying his character He looked and played music like his idol Elvis Presley br br Bob Saget Danny Bob Saget is also a great actor He looses his wife in car accident involving a drunk driver He has to raise three girls without a having the girl s Mother Bob Saget does a great job portraying a single parent who works full time and still has time to raise his three girls br br Dave Coulier Joey One word can describe Dave Coulier funny He is great Playing the character of Joey was perfect for him He does a great job playing the stand up comedian waiting for his big break br br Candice Cameron Bure DJ She is a tremendous actress She plays the oldest sister DJ which is short for Donna Jo She is one of the best actresses I have ever seen Her acting ability in Full House was very believable br br Jodie Sweetin Stephanie Two simple words can describe Jodie Sweetin incredibly amazing I wish I could say every thing that I would like to say about Jodie but I would use up the 1 000 word maximum just on her She got her start in a kids show called Mother Goose Stories and when she came to Full House she blew the audience s and creator s mind Her great looks and absolutely amazing acting ability helped to make the show the success that it was According to Dave Coulier Jodie was supposed to be the star of the show It was supposed to be where she was going to get her big break Jodie at five years old when the show first aired could hit every line perfectly She showed great enthusiasm Most young kids can t do this As you can probably guess Jodie Sweetin Stephanie is my favorite character in Full House br br Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen Michelle Great actress Full House is where they got their start They received the part of Michelle because they were the only babies who did not cry while in front of a camera br br There are many more cast members that should be recognized These are the original characters from when the show first went on the air in 1987 br br The only negative thing that I can say is how Full House became The Michelle Show towards the end I think it was to focused on her towards the end Especially when I think Jodie and Candice were much better at acting br br Full House is a great show for everyone It can teach you a lot One of the biggest things it can teach you is that everyone can live a great life even if a tragedy such as loosing a family member occurs Full House continues to attract new fans With all this said there is only a couple things left to say Full House will never die and thank you the cast of Full House for giving everyone a show that they can enjoy
I am only 11 years old but I discovered Full House when I was about five and watched it constantly until I was seven Then I grew older and figured Full House could wait and that I had more important things to do Plus there was also the fact that my younger brother who watched it faithfully with me for those two years started to dislike it thinking it too girly br br Then I realized every afternoon at five it was on 23 and I once again became addicted to it Full House has made me laugh and cry It s made me realize how nice it would be if our world was like the world of Full House plus a mom I have heard people say Full House is cheesy and unbelievable But look at the big picture three girls whose mom was killed by a drunk driver The sisters fight and get their feelings hurt The three men who live with the girls can get into bickers at times What s any more real than that br br If anything the show has lifted me up when I m down and brought me up even higher when I thought I was at the point of complete happiness I have howled like a hyena at the show and gained a massive obsessiveness over Mary Kate and Ashley Olsen Of course Hilary Duff has now taken that spot but they were literally the cutest babies I have ever seen They are great actresses and seem to be very nice people
I watched Speak Easily one night and thought it was o k but missing something Maybe Buster Keaton strangely speaking threw me off or the labored line delivery of a leading lady The next day I kept thinking about the movie though I couldn t get Durante s song out of my head I kept trying to better remember Thelma Todd s first scene I considered that maybe Keaton did do some funny falls and physical comedy The next night I watched a scene with Thelma Todd as a conniving chorus girl trying to impress Buster and Jimmy with her sex appeal A very funny scene the actors excellent their faces their eyes their silly expressions So I watched another scene their show is opening on Broadway Buster in his blissful innocence botches every act Again I was laughing out loud appreciating Keaton s clowning and tumbling So the next night I watched the whole movie again and this time I see it for the first time It s Stupendous It s Sensational It s Sublime Three great comedians Todd dances Durante sings Keaton speaks Sure it ain t poifect but there s a lot of laughs in this picture
Since it has been some years since I reviewed this classic I have decided to go back and review it more in dept but first some insider notes from a movie critic br br This animated series is one of those that I grew up with it made my childhood joyful it made it awesome miss some of this stuff today that we clearly don t see as much as we did back in the days well on to the review br br Talespin or Luftens Helte which it is called in Denmark is a great animated series it is much like chip and dale ducktales and a lot of those old ones so it has that weird feeling surrounding it i cannot remember this series as much as I would like to remember it br br But in my opinion it was very great it came with some kind of message not that wild of a message however it is one of the old ones so that can be forgiven br br Now i don t want to sound old or anything but i feel like time slipped out of my hands with these cartoons today we see something like Ed Edd and Eddy or anything else weird like that we have all these new or nearly new shows like Hannah Montana or something like that yet I feel like that we don t have the same spirit in cartoons or real shows like we did in the early days br br Now maybe i am wrong but i feel like time has changed to much to conclude i would be thrilled to see these series like Talespin being released again to the TV screen instead of all the new ones give me back my childhood cartoons give them to the kids i have some day give them again
I used to watch this show when I was a little girl When I think about it I only remember it vaguely If you ask me it was a good show Two things I remember vaguely are the opening sequence and theme song In addition to that everyone was ideally cast Also the writing was very strong The performances were top grade too I hope some network brings it back so I can see every episode Before I wrap this up I d like to say that I ll always remember this show in my memory forever even though I don t think I ve seen every episode Now in conclusion if some network ever brings it back I hope that you catch it one day before it goes off the air for good
Thanks Jymn Magon for creating Disney s 2 best cartoons ever This show has improved very much over the years As a kid I didn t like it because I thought it was a rip off of Ducktales which was my favorite Disney thing at the time like Grandmoffromero Then later on though it was good but not great But after reading the reviews here I decided to give it another chance bought the DVD set watched the whole pilot the first day I got it was very pleasantly surprised It s still my favorite episode although the series did live up to it And by the end of disc 1 I knew this was going to be a top tenner br br The characters are so complex charming My favorite has got to be Wildcat He s absolutely hilarious and sweet to boot My next favorite is Baloo the best pilot on the show I can see why ol Jymn built the show around him Then it s Kit Cloudkicker He Baloo have the best relationship in the series After that Louie Jim Cummings did a perfect job of impersonating the original voice After him Rebecca She has made me laugh pretty hard and I do believe she and Baloo eventually marry And finally for the heroes Molly Although she s my least favorite I still like her I think she s a very cute character much better than Webby from Ducktales And the villains were very original Don Karnage his air pirates always crack me up Kahn is ice cold and ruthless and the Thembrians are always at least amusing br br As said before the stories range from hilarious Time Waits For No Bear Romance of Red Chimp to nothing short of touching The Old Man the Seaduck Paradise Lost to fun funny exciting adventures In Search of Ancient Blunders my favorite For Whom the Bell Klangs These are only a few of my favorite episodes Anyway Talespin is Disney s best aside from Gummi Bears Some reasons for this GB had a decent amount of my favorite character Cubbi while TS didn t have enough of Wildcat But in the end Talespin remains a classic BOTTOM LINE 10 10 6th best cartoon ever
In the year 1990 the world of Disney TV cartoons was certainly at it s prime Shows like Chip n Dale Rescue Rangers DuckTales and Gummi Bears was already popular and now Disney made another great cartoon and that cartoon brought the birth of the Disney Afternoon That cartoon is called TaleSpin It s about old Jungle Book character Baloo the Bear as he gets a job in the plane business In the series he meets Kit Cloudkicker former Air Pirate and good cloud surfer business lady Rebecca Cunningham and her hyperactive daughter Molly This series is very funny and has tons of great puns that you may not understand as a kid but understand later on in life This is one cleverly written series and it s great to add to your DVD collection Parents buy this for your kids rather letting them watch all of those horrible Nickelodeon cartoons If you liked TaleSpin then check out Darkwing Duck and Goof Troop Spin it
Ahh Talespin What can I say that hasn t already been said about this great show Nothing This is without a doubt one of the most well written shows I ve ever encountered live action or animation The newer stuff is way too dumbed down for my tastes and some of the mature stuff I have to shoo kids out of the room for But not Talespin br br The stories are engaging and very plausible Some of them could even be stretched out to an hour or two for a movie Episodes like Stormy Weather and Her Chance to Dream are very dramatic while still being enjoyable for kids and adults alike Then there are the pure comedy episodes such as the Bluest of the Baloo Bloods and Stuck on you where the emphasis is on hilarity I can laugh myself to tears in a few choice ones br br The drama aspect is very lacking in most shows nowadays at least those which aren t specifically geared toward it especially in cartoons In the episode Stormy Weather for instance Kit Cloudkicker decides that he s going to join an air circus but Baloo believes that it would be too dangerous In the biggest fight of the episode Baloo yells at Kit to stay away from Daring Dan to which Kit screams NO You can t tell me what to do YOUR RE NOT MY DAD and buries his face in his pillow The next day he leaves for the air circus This kind of drama is a rarity in a cartoon and would be most welcome in the ones created nowadays br br The Characters have a lot of depth to them Baloo is pretty much the way he is in The Jungle Book plus or minus a few degrees of laziness Rebecca is a cunning business woman whose ideas on getting money while good in theory are seldom good in practice Molly is a cute little girl but you can t let that deceive you She can be a real hellion sometimes Kit Cloudkicker is a darker character than the rest He doesn t trust adults much unless they appeal to him and he has a tendency to break off relationships Watch his expression in Plunder and Lightning when he grabs the grappling hook he looks as though he s prepared to put it right through a pirate br br In the end it s the drama combined with the very real chemistry between the characters that makes this show 1 in my book The relationship between Baloo and Kit is very real almost father and son This is demonstrated well in All s Whale That Ends Whale when Baloo takes Kit s word for it that Seymour is abusing the animals in his aquarium instead of siding with the other adults Baloo and Becky s relationship is also realistic due to Baloo s motivation for working comes from wanting to buy back the ol Sea Duck not necessarily a desire to help Rebecca But something tells me that if he did get the Duck back he d still do jobs for Rebecca br br The Sea Duck not to mention all the other planes in the series is pretty realistically designed The plane s functions don t change once throughout the series continuity like that is hard to come by also and unlike most other super planes of other cartoons it doesn t have one single weapon on board unless you count mangoes and relies instead on it s cunning pilot s great skill to get out of trouble It s hard to think of a hero vehicle that doesn t have some sort of gun turret laser cannon or even a handgun somewhere on board And the fact that they use their heads to get out of trouble is so hard to find in a cartoon nowadays Plus it s just such a darn cool design br br This is definitely the best cartoon Ever Period Definitely worth all ten stars
Ever since I remember I have loved airplanes and flying I am now in college with a private pilot s license and looking to become a commercial I could never remember why I was so obsessed with the subject until I came across my old Tail Spin tapes in my basement at home and it hit me this was it My parents bought every single tape they had and this was the only show I would watch as a kid I had the theme memorized as I grew up and I can still re cite it today It is absolutely amazing and I plan on buying the DVD s soon It really is great for children and adults and is absolutely timeless I cannot get enough of this show
Along with Darkwing Duck this is unfairly cancelled Disney has been in decline since Tarzan and we need a show like this to get Disney back on track Ed Gilbert and Jim Cummings were perfect for the voices of Louis and Baloo sounds familiar The theme theme tune is also catchy Out of all the villains which are all great on their own merits Tony Jay stands out as Shere Kahn Louis and Baloo actually sound very similar to the voice overs in the Jungle Book which isn t a bad thing at all As a matter of fact it s quite inspirational The animation was spot on and the script had plenty of wit that has been severely lacking in animations for years PLEASE BRING THIS SHOW BACK 9 10 Bethany Cox
As for many on here I can t help but praise the Cast and Crew who developed Talespin and others they made throughout My Childhood I as all who have commented here have thoroughly enjoyed the Quality of not just the animation but the quality of the story lines and the characters br br To Class this work of art as a Cartoon could never do talespin justice In fact it s an insult to class it as a Cartoon Talespin is an Animation and nothing less It is evidently the greatest work of genius to be produced at Disney to date When Disney Pulled it from the air little did they realise what they did and I m sure their souls have been tortured by regret ever since br br I ll take a moment to explain From the first which is ducktales to the last which I think is Darkwing Duck Disney has been plagued with failures due to political Correctness and have taken a Quantum Leap backwards since They prefer Quantity over Quality now not to mention the room full of Monkey s for the story s I couldn t have My children watching the mind numbing Cartoons they throw out now in fear that they would all turn out to be homer Simpson some time in the future and 50 of the blame would be on me for permitting them to watch it I couldn t let that happen Which is why I have ALL of the shows from the late 80 s to the mid 90 s on a Harddrive so one day My children couldn t be corrupted by the Cartoon Crap of today and to Savour the last piece of childhood I have and to hold on to and I owe that all to Talespin br br Talespin to me is without a doubt the best Animation ever produced in the world on account of it s depth Charm Wit Compassion Emotion and lack of Truly bad quality and story lines of which many have today Do You see any of that content in say Ed Edd and Eddie or anything else You can think of The rubbish produced today can be likened to some 3 year old s undecipherable Hyroglyph Depicting a Picasso br br The next time You watch an episode of Talespin take a look at the woodgrain on any wooden object or building such as Higher for Hire and salivate over the quality of workmanship and effort put into this Animation Even the one shot backgrounds were done as though they would use them again and again The Buildings look true to the Art Deco movement which was popular in the time period depicted Even the vehicles are true to life OK not ALL of the Episodes Were Fantastic in animation but the lower grade scenes were covered up by the superior scenes so all in all it evened it all out by the end of the episode and You d probably never even notice at all unless you were focused and have an attention to detail br br The one thing I love about this is what I like to call the Deliberate Mistakes or Intended Mistakes in each episode and some have two For example in sheepskin deep where rebecca say s You re up to something Baloo and Baloo replies Who Me I m as innocent as a schoolboy take a look into rebecca s eyes I won t spoil the rest of the Baloopers but just keep an Eye out next time br br Everyone elses comment s are bang on and 100 correct I have nothing else to add that others haven t said already on here Disney WAKE UP and smell the coffee You have been asleep for over a decade Stop producing rubbish and bring back Quality into Animations and Stop producing Cartoons We have seen the proof of what You can do and We want it back as rapidly as possible

If you are viewing this show for the first time you may start wondering if you are in an alternate reality Colorful and imaginative characters Entertaining dialogue Plots that seem to have some depth to them even creating atmospheres of suspense and drama at times I mean this is a syndicated children s show right This is the same venue that has brought kids such drek as Pokemon Pepper Ann Mighty Morphin Power Rangers and VR Troopers please note that three of the titles mentioned above are crass Japanese exports courtesy of the Fox Network and Saban Entertainment Don t worry you are just sampling some of the quality fare that was available to kids during the late 1980 s and early 1990 s Some examples of this period would be Transformers Garfield and Friends Captain Power and C O P S a cartoon NOT to be confused with the live action show on Fox Besides these prime examples Disney also returned to syndicated programs for kids coming up with a lineup called The Disney Afternoon Aside from a dumbed down show called The Gummi Bears early shows like Darkwing Duck Duck Tales and Chip N Dale s Rescue Rangers gave credence to the Disney animation teams that were also turning out theatrical classics like The Little Mermaid Beauty and the Beast The Rescuers Down Under and The Great Mouse Detective But above all these wonders shines TaleSpin The premiere of Plunder and Lightning was a two hour thrill ride and won an Emmy Much to my delight the rest of the episodes were up to par on the promise of the premiere br br While I enjoy the plots and dialogue I guess for me the greatest attraction are the characters There s Rebecca Cunningham an independent female but still fallible Kit Cloudkicker full of pre teen angst and optimism Louie with his loyalty and support Frank Wildcat the most entertaining engineer since Scotty on the original Star Trek Molly Cunningham cute and witty but with some depth that most child characters don t have and of course in the middle of it all there s Baloo whom I would describe as a slobby version of James Bond This is because whenever there s trouble Baloo saves the day with the assistance of his sleeker than most fastest of all Sea Duck Read James Bond s Aston Martin Of course every great show has to have great villains and TaleSpin doesn t disappoint here either From the megalomania of businesstiger Shere Kahn to the vain and always failing air pirate Don Karnage to the hilarious and inept Soviet satirized Thembrians The animation is good the music appropriate and the episodes are for me the finest that children s programming has ever had to offer Great fun for the WHOLE family
Brilliant kung fu scenes loads of melodrama peculiar footwear symbolism and an unhappy end makes Barefoot Kid an unforgettable film br br One of the silliest subtitles I ve seen
This movie was beautiful It was full of memorable imagery good acting and touching subject matter It would be very easy to write it off as being too sentimental but that is the sentiments this type of a movie is trying to achieve I was totally involved in the story s unfolding and presentation There were a few cheesy shots but such is to be expected in a religious propaganda film The only complaint I can conjure is there wasn t a ton of details However this movie wasn t created to explain every element of Joseph Smith s life ministry triumphs controversies failures etc it was designed for a quick glimpse at a few highlights of one of the most amazing American and historical religious figures of all time
I have seen this wonderful production and I wonder if anyone can tell me anything about the actress who played the blacksmith s wife I am not sure of her character s name I went to BYU with her and lost touch with her her maiden name was Kim Luke and I wonder if anyone has any info on her She is not listed in the credits This production was outstanding a tear jerker on all accounts superb acting by all I guess I don t even want to put it in the general category of acting more like portraying with feeling the amazing events that led to the opening of the Heavens for this the final dispensation something like that If anyone worked with Kim or has a website or something please let me know She was fantastic in her role by the way Thanks Melissa Thorne
I think the film is educational However it fails to treat the issue which sparked so much controversy plural marriage Also the film fails to reveal what the LDS church espouses Big opportunity was missed to tell the world what they actually believe I could not get a clear idea of what it is LDS views are on central topics of religion br br I have many LDS friends and they are nice people Would have been nice to get a clearer picture of how they view their prophet s more controversial statements Maybe these statements are just too controversial to be treated in a film format but it would have been great to hear the whole story of Joseph Smith s truly interesting life After all it gives insight into American thought on religion in the 18th century Hope they do some documentaries on this fascinating subject allowing historians to comment on Smith s life We may have a Mormon president some day After all Smith ran for president
I don t know what movie some of these other people watched but they must have seen a different Joseph Smith Prophet of the Restoration than the one I saw br br I think the movie was both well done and inspiring I think it s definitely worth watching It s apparent from the outset that a lot of care went into the making of this film The background scenery is beautiful br br I think the film does a good job of portraying Joseph Smith both as a man and as a prophet Joseph s spiritual experiences are portrayed with taste and reverence br br I would definitely recommend watching this movie
Despite reading the initial comments from someone who curiously disliked the film WHY IS THE ONLY NEGATIVE COMMENT VERY FIRST ON THE LIST it was very nice to note that virtually everyone else loved it Obviously the Church wanted to stress certain points and portray the prophet Joseph Smith in a positive manner thats the whole idea And in fact those points were extremely effective We already know Joseph Smith was human but despite that AND all of the horrific negative attempts stirred on by the adversary it showed just how he was able to complete a remarkable God given work I d recommend it to anyone
As a convert into the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints I try to absorb as much as I can of my new religion s history I was invited to attend a showing of this film with my sons the other young men women as well as their families of our ward br br On a beautiful spring evening we drove to Kirtland Ohio to the church s historical village located there We were to have had reservations at the Vistor s Center to view this movie Since my movie viewing was limited to only a few church documentaries I was intrigued The only full length motion pictures of the church s I had seen was Legacy and My Best Two Years both which I thought were very well written and preformed br br At the beginning the missionary interpretor passed out tissues stating that several people had been deeply moved to the point of tears by this movie I thought OK but it takes a lot to move me to tears Imagine my surprise when I found myself sobbing It truly is a very moving inspirational testament to the Prophet Joseph Smith br br See it believe in it s powerful message
This film is a true and historical film It is very useful to those researching the LDS church because it is 100 true It is an excellent film and I recommend it br br It is very factual exciting and motivational There are some who think it is not factual but it is br br It is about the restoration of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints and about the prophet Joseph Smith who restored it It has such events in his life as the disease that he had when he was a small boy his courting Emma Smith Emma his wife giving birth and so on But most importantly it reveals the restoration of the church
This movie was the best movie I have ever seen Being LDS I highly recommend this movie because you are able to feel a more understanding about the life of Joseph Smith Although the movie was not made with highly acclaimed actors it is a remarkable and life changing movie that can be enjoyed and appreciated by everyone I saw this movie with my family and I can bear witness that we have all had a change of heart This movie allows people to really understand how hard the life was for the prophet and how much tribulation he was faced with After I saw this movie there was not a single dry eye in the entire room Everyone was touched by what they saw and I have not been the same since I have seen it I highly recommend this movie for everyone
The most amazing spiritually uplifting movie about the restoration of the gospel Far better than any other film or movie made about the restoration thus far If you haven t seen it hop on a plane to Salt Lake and see it now You won t regret it You truly get a sense of what the first saints had to struggle through putting complete and total faith in there prophet Joseph Smith You finally get some sort of comprehension of the things the prophet had to fight through and the persecutions he and his people faced If you have any questions about the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter days Saints and our humble beginnings just watch this movie it will make complete and total sense afterward
This is one of the most spiritual movies I have ever seen I headed up with about 150 people to St George and we saw this movie in the visiting center of the St George temple Not one person had dry eyes in the audience Also there were some non religious and anti Mormon people in the audience who felt the spirit of the movie and were touched by the captivating music and reenactment of the story of the pioneers and the hardships they faced because of their beliefs br br I recommend this movie for anyone who wishes to understand more about Joseph and the hardships that the pioneers went through After all it is apart of American History
This movie makes a statement about Joseph Smith what he stood for and what the LDS church believes With all the current media coverage of a certain fugitive people have confused the LDS church with the FLDS church and criminal fugitive Warren Jeffs Jeffs is Not associated with the LDS church yet media groups internationally have asked for comments about Jeffs from The LDS church Jeffs is not mentioned in the movie at all but I think that it is ironic that this movie with all it s points about Joseph also point away from the fews of the FLDS church and their leader at this time in the media world This is a movie about Joseph Smith and a great one at that Some of the most obvious differences between Jeffs and Joseph is portrayed in Joseph s humanity acceptance and love Jeffs views and opinions differ greatly from Joseph Smith and the LDS Church and it is seen in this movie Jeffs thinks of the Negro as devils Joseph Smith knew they were children of god and gave up his wife s favorite horse to a African American former slave to buy his son s freedom Joseph is shown doing housework for his wife Emma and is criticized by a member until Joseph tells him that a man may lose his wife in the next life if she chooses not to stay with her husband and that doing chores is a way to help and cherish your wife Jeffs brought one of his polygamist wives to her knees in front of a class full of students by grabbing her braid and twisting it painfully till she came to her knees Lastly Joseph participated with law enforcement and sought aid from the government at all times Jeffs thumbs his nose at government and flees at all times br br I loved this movie and if you don t know much about Joseph Smith and what the LDS church believes then this is the movie to see And if you had confused the LDS Church with the FLDS church then you really need to get your act together We are not much different from anyone who believes in Jesus Christ the Sanctity of marriage and the family as well a patriotic to our homeland and country We are all different as well just like you can find different protestants Presbyterians methodist baptist and Catholics What s important is our message and what we stand for This movie trys to portray that but there is so much of Joseph s life that can t be covered in a mere 2 hour movie This was a really great show
I really thought they did an excellent job there was nothing wrong with it at all I don t know how the first commenter could have said it was terrible it moved me to tears I guess it moved about everyone to tears but I try not to cry in a movie because it s embarrassing but this one got me It was SOOO good I hope they release it on DVD because I will definitely buy a copy I feel like it renewed my faith and gave me a hope that I can t explain it made me want to strive to be a better person they went through so much and we kind of take that for granted I guess Compared to that I feel like our own trials are nothing Well not nothing but they hardly match what they had to go through I loved it Who played Emma
Warning mild spoilers br br The story of Joseph Smith stands out as an amazing even moving episode in American history and World Religious history This movie portrays events in the life of Joseph Smith whom Mormons revere as the prophet of the restoration of the true Church of Jesus Christ on the earth I ve so far seen the movie twice in its first month of public showing br br Joseph Smith is shown first to be the youngest of a trio of brothers Alvin Hyrum Joseph who at a very young age needed an operation The operation done without our modern conveniences was bloody and difficult The scene helped to show the cohesiveness of the Smith family and the bonds between the brothers and between Joseph and his parents br br Joseph s religious confusion and subsequent praying which lead to what Mormons call the First Vision was interestingly portrayed The face of Jesus is never shown but you see the unmistakable nail marks in His hands The rejection by religious leaders and many in his small New York community is sweetened at least slightly by Joseph s marriage to Emma br br This movie does not clearly map out the events of Mormon Church history but merely jumps from scene to scene This is not a critique simply a note about the style br br The practice of tarring and feathering is shown and it is especially dramatic and moving when Joseph delivers a sermon about the Savior s love with a scarred face from having recently been attacked br br The movie masterfully portrays simultaneously the joy and growth of Mormonism as an infant church while at the same time the ever deepening opposition that spread into the heights of local governments br br The film shows many scenes from Joseph s life including a few beautiful moments portraying his relationship to Emma An attempt is made to show the depth and complexity of Joseph s life including his fierce love for his wife his endless love for children his wit his courage in the face of filthy and dangerous opposition his religious sentiments and his compassion br br As Joseph and Hyrum ride to Carthage never to return home alive most of the characters from throughout the movie whose lives had been touched by Joseph are shown along the way helping to reinforce what was already seen but setting up the final scene to be more powerful br br At the end the martyrdom of Joseph and Hyrum is portrayed and moviegoers are left to ponder the events they just witnessed br br When I first watched the movie I assumed it was made by the Church to introduce Joseph Smith to non members I no longer think that is the case although I hope the movie can do just that As an insider I find that the film is a celebration of Joseph and excellently reinforces the good things we already know about him I am curious to see how outsiders will view the film whether they will simply see it as propagandic an epic story of an American religious man or something else br br The film is beautifully shot family friendly moving and hopefully something good for everyone That the events portrayed actually happened in these United States of America is interesting to ponder in light of the many aspects of our culture including freedom of religious expression and respect generally for the law we moderns take for granted
I am stunned at the negative comments that I have read and can only assume that the people making such comments were less than honest This is the most moving and real portrayal of Joseph Smith that I have ever seen It was well acted to the point that at times I forgot that I was watching a movie It brought Joseph s life of hardship good natured optimism enduring faith in people and God and ultimate sacrifice to life such in a way that frankly left me speechless and silent in awe If anyone of ANY Christian religion can watch this movie without being touched in some positive way I would have to say it is a reflection of the individual and NOT the movie I give the movie a 10 and encourage honest souls to view it At the very LEAST it is an extremely heart felt portrayal of man who gave everything he had for what he believed In a world where values and beliefs are ridiculed this movie stands as a enduring reminder of the kind of people we are supposed to be no matter what religious beliefs we hold Ann Pruitt
I saw it at the Legacy Theater in the Joseph Smith Memorial Building in Salt Lake City this morning I m going to assume that one s level of enjoyment during this movie will largely be based on one s level of acceptance of Joseph s story br br However that aside it was very well made well acted and had a nice score If you get to Salt Lake City it is a must to see it in the Legacy Theater I have never been in a nicer theater as far as picture quality sound quality and ambiance in my entire life I wonder if the Church would let me watch Batman Begins there Being that I m LDS and regard Joseph as a prophet I was touched in several places and was brought to tears quite a few times which I presume is expected since they handed out tissues BEFORE the movie started Anyway I m told that this film is available in several LDS Visitor Centers around the globe if you have 70 minutes check it out because whether you believe Joseph Smith or not he tells a fascinating story
After reading the comments to this movie and seeing the mixed reviews I decided that I would add my ten cents worth to say I thought the film was excellent not only in the visual beauty the writing music score acting and directing but in putting across the story of Joseph Smith and the road he traveled through life of hardship and persecution for believing in God the way he felt and knew to be his path I am very pleased indeed to have had a small part in telling the story of this remarkable man I recommend everyone to see this when the opportunity presents itself no matter what religious path he or she may be walking this only instills one with more determination to live the life that we should with true values of love and forgiveness as the Savior taught us to do
This is by far the most incredible movie I have seen in a long time The actors gave wonderful portrayals of the characters in the movie The story was accurately portrayed The story starts out with a young woman from the British Isles and her father traveling by steamboat to Nauvoo Illinois She has become a member of the LDS Church and he has not He thinks she is ridiculous for making the trip and is discouraging She encourages him to read about Joseph Smith the Prophet This is where the story of the Prophet Joseph Smith begins The movie accurately portrays his life and some of the history of the LDS Church at the same time It was graphic at times but was needed The emotional expression was very believable which caused my emotions to spill out Filming was awesome The way in which the story was presented was touching After the movie was over we just sat there unable to moved I was stunned For people who know very little of Joseph Smith the Mormon Prophet I would encourage you to see this If nothing else but to gain some understanding of his life For those who are members of the Church I would encourage you to see it It will increase your testimony of this most incredible man This is a must see
Thought at first this film would be your typical Western film however it turned out to be very interesting and kept me spellbound right to the very end which turned out very unusual Charlton Heston Sam Burgade Midway 76 had past experiences with James Coburn Zach Provo Deadfall 93 and Zach never forgave Sam and would stop at nothing to make sure he caught up with him and paid him back Unfortunately Barbara Hershey Susan Burgade The Portrait of a Lady 96 managed to get caught up in this situation and found herself among sex starved men who never seemed to leave her alone Sam Burgade had to make some very hard decisions and and I was quite surprised at the conclusion This is a very entertaining film and the acting was outstanding
Good western filmed in the rocky Arizona wilds Lots of tough guys throughout Cobern s character seemed to rock back and forth between a raging psycho and a laid back type Several holes appeared in the picture but not enough to offset it being exciting and worth seeing One really dumb scene shows Heston emptying 45 cases of their powder and collecting it in a sack for the purpose of starting a fire A To gather that much gunpowder he would have needed a pack mule to carry the ammo B The grass was obviously dry why not just drop a match on it and let er rip
The Last Hard Men is a typical western for the 70 s Most of them seem to be inspired by Sam Peckinpah Also this one but Director Andrew McLaglan is a John Ford Pupil and this can be obviously shown in many scenes IMO the beginning is very good In a certain way McLaglan wanted to show the audience a travel from the civilization to the wilderness In the third part there are some illogical flaws and I complain a bit about Charlton Heston He has to play an old ex lawman named Sam Burgade but he is in a fantastic physical shape I never got the feeling that he really has problems to climb on a horse or on a rock For me he didn t looks very motivated as he usual do in most of his epic movies Same goes to the beautiful Barbara Hershey who is playing the sheriff s daughter Maybe both had troubles with the director or were unhappy with their roles Hershey and Coburn are not showing their best but they are still good If the scriptwriter had John Wayne in their mind as Sam Burgade Also Michael Parks as modern sheriff is a bit underused in his role On the other Hand there is James Coburn as outlaw Zach Provo Coburn is a really great villain in this one He is portraying the bad guy between maniac hate and cleverness His role and his acting is the best of the movie br br Landscapes and Shootouts are terrific The shootings scenes are bloody and the violence looks realistic Zach Provo and his gang had some gory and violent scenes What I miss is the typical western action in the middle of the movie I would have appreciated a bank robbery or something similar Overall it s an entertaining western flick Not a great movie but above the average because of a great Coburn a very good beginning and some gory and violent scenes
SPOILERS Seething with hatred and revenge half breed Zach Provo James Coburn had spent the last 11 years on a chain gang planing his escape What Provo want s more then freedom is to even the score with the man who captured him and in the process during a wild shootout killed his Navajo wife The former Pima County sheriff Sam Burgade Charlton Heston br br Making his escape after killing two prison guards Provo makes his way towards Yuma knowing that that s not just where Burgade lives but where his his young daughter Susan Barbara Hershey resides as well Using his fellow escaped convicts to lure Burgade into the vast Arizona Desert by promising them 30 000 00 in gold coins that he buried there Provo plans to exact his bloody vengeance on Burgade But only after having him witness his daughter being brutally raped by his fellow convicts or are in not being with a woman for years as horny as a rabbit during mating season br br Brutal and very effective western that updates the John Wayne 1956 classic The Searchers in a father searching through dangerous Indian territory for his kidnapped daughter Charlton Heston as the guilt ridden Sam Burgade in his felling somehow responsible for killing Provo s wife and then having to face the fact that the same thing can very well happen to his daughter Susan is perfect in the role of the aging and retired sheriff Charles Coburn as the vengeful half breed Zach Provo is also at his best as the obsessed with hatred and murder escaped convict br br The man who escaped with Provo are really not interest in his personal affairs but have no choice in that he knows the territory like the back of his hand but to go along with him It s only the thought of them having their way with Susan when Provo gives them the green light as well as the buried 30 000 00 in gold coins that keeps them from breaking up and going their own way br br Also going along with Burgade is Susan s boyfriend Hal Brickman Chris Mitchum who proves in the end that he s as good as Burgade is who felt that he just didn t have it in him in both tracking down the escaped criminals as well as using common sense which in this case Burgade lacks in doing it br br SPOILERS The unbelievably brutal and blood splattered showdown between Burgade and Provo is almost too much to sit through Provo who s hatred of Burgade bordered on out right insanity wanted him to suffer a slow and excruciating death it was that hatred that Bugrade took advantage of and after taking some half dozen bullets thus ended up putting the crazed and blood thirsty as well as mindless lunatic away for good
I ve seen this film on Sky Cinema not too long ago I must admit it was a really good Western which features 2 of the big names On one side there s Charlton Heston playing the infamous and retired lawman Samuel Burgade On the other The late James Coburn playing the villainous Zach Provo seeking revenge on Burgade no matter what the cost br br The good thing about this film was there was some really good characters Most of the actors played it out really well Especially James Coburn who I find that he was really mean in this film But that how it was br br Christopher Mitchum who I ve seen everywhere in other films Playing Hal Brickman I felt his character was left out in the cold but he manage to get himself back in by teaming up with Burgade to bring down Provo s posse s br br All in all it was a great film Very good to watch Great score from the late Jerry Goldsmith br br Wonderful piece of Western persona 8 out of 10
The Last Hard Men finds James Coburn an outlaw doing a long sentence breaking free from a chain gang Do he and his friends head for the Mexican border from jail and safety No they don t because Coburn has a mission of revenge To kill the peace officer who brought him in and in the process killed his woman br br That peace officer is Charlton Heston who is now retired and he knows what Coburn is after As he explains it to his daughter Barbara Hershey Coburn was holed up in a shack and was involved in a Waco like standoff His Indian woman was killed in the hail of bullets fired It s not something he s proud of she was a collateral casualty in a manhunt br br Lest we feel sorry for Coburn he lets us know full well what an evil man he truly is Heston is his usual stalwart hero but the acting honors in The Last Hard Men go to James Coburn He blows everyone else off the screen when he s on br br Coburn gets the bright idea of making sure Heston trails him by kidnapping Hershey and taking her to an Indian reservation where the white authorities can t touch him He knows that Heston has to make it personal then br br Coburn s gang includes Morgan Paull Thalmus Rasulala John Quade Larry Wilcox and Jorge Rivero Heston has Chris Mitchum along who is his son in law to be br br The Last Hard Men is one nasty and brutal western Andrew McLaglen directed it and I m thinking it may have been a project originally intended for Sam Peckinpaugh It sure shows a lot of his influence with the liberal use of slow motion to accentuate the violence Of which there is a lot br br For a little Peckinpaugh lite The Last Hard Men is your film
This hard hitting often violent western in the Peckinpah Leone tradition is surprisingly directed by Andrew V McLaglen whose previous westerns particularly those that starred John Wayne were mainly in the John Ford mode It is both surprisingly traditional good guys bad guys and incredible up to date as well br br Heston portrays a former captain of the Arizona territorial police who has been in retirement for a year having turned over the law enforcement reins to a reform minded sheriff Michael Parks and finding his ways of enforcing the law being taken over by autos telegraphs telephones and the railroad in the first years of the 20th century But soon he is confronted with a menace from his past a half breed outlaw Coburn that he put away more than a decade before for a train robbery that killed four guards In a subsequent shootout Coburn s wife was killed and so Coburn is out for a most nasty sort of revenge It involves the kidnapping and eventually the rape of Heston s daughter Hershey by him and his gang The result is a taut and violent pursuit through the mountains and deserts of southern Arizona br br THE LAST HARD MEN based on Brian Garfield s novel Gun Down is violent in many places including the showdown between Heston and Coburn and the rape scene involving Hershey and two members of Coburn s gang Quade Paull is probably every bit as questionable as similar scenes in STRAW DOGS and DELIVERANCE But that doesn t detract too terribly much from the film s psychological approach to the western genre McLaglen is able to handle the bloody story with significant panache and Heston s performance as an aging lawman was probably the best one he ever gave in any of his 1970s films Coburn makes for an especially cold blooded heavy and both Parks and Chris Mitchum as Hershey s intended husband do good turns as well The music here is cribbed from Jerry Goldsmith s scores to 100 RIFLES and the 1966 remake of STAGECOACH but it still works here br br Wisely filmed totally on location in southeastern Arizona and utilizing the Old Tucson set THE LAST HARD MEN needs to be released by Fox on VHS and or DVD soon It is a western that deserves nothing less
As a huge fan of the original I avoided this film like the plague when the bad reviews started coming in eight years ago but I just finished watching this film and found it to be a really pleasant surprise br br Okay if you are looking for a retread of the original you re in for a big disappointment but if you are looking for something quite different a bit edgy and political then this is the film for you br br Gregory is now thirty four and works as a teacher at his old comprehensive school where he s being pursued by a fellow teacher and having sexual dreams about one of his students When the student insists on meeting up with Gregory a series of misadventures ensue that include torture breaking and entering and all manner of unexpected twists and turns that left me feeling elated and moved br br If you are looking for something original then I highly recommend this film I only wish that more people had gone to see this when it was released and seen it for what it really is
A shift in outlook is neccesary to enjoy modern British films one that somehow allows them to be seen in their own right and for their own qualities rather than by the criteria that American films are judged Britfilm has to try hard to be gritty and finds it hard to make it but at warmth British films can lord it over their otherwise overwhelming competitor br br This film fails not in its content but only in attaching itself to the predeccesor so allowing it to be all to easily seen as the work of star and director somewhere near the end of their tethers It s a couple of decades later Gregory teaching and this time with two girls on his mind He teaches at his school railing against human rights abuses When students he s fired up find abuses in their midst he must face whether he s just all talk br br This is a subversive film in that there s not the usual worldly character of any American movie that you expect to do whatever he does but a naive man boy who may still put everything on the line for principles Maybe It s certainly no protest by numbers though being too warm Where U S film may seem realistic because they re urban and gritty this and other British films of recent years those that don t try to match America for visceral thrills are real because British humour reveals truths
The good thing about this film is that it stands alone you don t have to have seen the original Unfortunately this is also it s biggest drawback It would have been nice to have included a few of the original characters in the new story and seen how their lives had developed Sinclair as in the original is excellent and provides the films best comic moments as he attempts to deal with awkward and embarrassing situations but the supporting cast is not as strong as in the original movie Forsyth is to be congratulated on a brave attempt to move the character on and create an original sequel but the film is ultimately flawed and lacks the warmth of the original
Somewhere near the bottom of the film studio ladder you can find companies like U F O Troma and beneath them lie Seduction cinema br br Seduction is a direct to video production company that specialize in lesbian themed non hardcore erotic movies It has developed a very dedicated fan base that purchase each new title as they are released but sadly the company has become too closely associated with frequent star Misty Mundae I say sadly because recent mainstream interest and her appearance on the show Masters of Horrors has caused her to set her sights a little higher than the zero budget S C efforts which forces the company to find a new identity But back in their glory days they released this film on a very appreciative world br br The gorgeous Misty Mundae is forced to attend a boarding school at the request of a absent father At the school she meets her absurdly hot room mate played by Ruby Larocca who immediately has designs on her but the headmistress Barbara Joyce has other plans In typical S C style the movie stops every ten minutes for a extended sex scene but unlike most of their efforts this one has a somewhat interesting story and a couple of good performances Ms Larocca appears to be having a great time as the sexual predator who views Misty as a tasty meal and Darian Caine makes a welcome though brief appearance as Satan This is the sort of film that Jess Franco would crank out in the 70s although this one does not have the hardcore sex that Franco was always willing to throw in for foreign sales and fans of that madman s work would be wise to give this one a go br br To me as a long time zero budget cinema fan and Troma worshiper I came across the Seduction cinema films through their parody films Playmate of the apes Who wants to be a erotic billionaire but I actually prefer their more original works You either see past the low budget and occasionally weak acting or you get hung up on these things and just hate all of these films For me the most obvious thing that unites these no budget movies is a real sense of fun These low budget companies are able to create their own unique style which gives the viewer something very different from the bland by the numbers studio efforts that load up the multiplexes br br If you have never seen a Seduction cinema film either this or Sin Sisters featuring both of the Mundae sisters are excellent choices to begin with This one is a fun fast paced film although the frequent exterior shots of the school do get a little old and the DVD is totally loaded with extras including a ton of previews of other company offerings a great behind the scenes featurette and some deleted scenes including a alternate opening I do recommend you pass on the disc s bonus feature the first film by director as it is quite weak and not really worth viewing
I have to say that this TV movie was the work that really showed how talented Melissa Joan Hart is We are so used to now seeing her in a sitcom and I really hope that a TV station will show this TV movie again soon as it will show the Sabrina fans that MJH shines in a drama Seen as we have watched her on Sabrina now for now 5 years and so to give the viewers a taste of her much unused talent would be a plus Melissa plays her role so well in this wanting her parents done away with so she can be with the guy she loves One thing that all Sabrina viewers will notice Melissa works with David Lascher in this well before he took the role of Josh on Sabrina So it would be kind of neat to see this currently whenever it gets aired again Hopefully MJH gets some good roles in movies or even in more TV Movies sort of like Kellie Martin who has always shined in TV Movies Lots of unused talent waiting to bust out when it comes to Melissa Joan Hart you shine always Melissa
I have seen it i like it Melissa plays her part well It was actually believable My brother in law saw it with my sister i and when i mentioned to my sister that i forgot it was based on a true story i had seen it a few years ago he said just because its on lifetime you think its true both my sister i were like it was so anyway i was wondering if anyone knew what murder it was or like who was really involved was because i want to prove it to him I love lifetime movies especially the ones that are true or just the ones that teach a good lesson I thought I saw something about it a week ago but i cant remember where any help would be appreciated
This movie is totally wicked It s really great to see MJH in a different role than her Sabrina character The plot is totally cool and the characters are excellently written Definitely one of the best movies
I like the movie Twisted Desire had Jeremy Jordan one of my favorite and one of the cutest actors ever Melissa Joan Hart is a good actress I ve seen most of her movies but all of Jeremy Jordan s The thing i dislike about Twisted Desire is when Nick gets arrested and Jennifer rats him out Twisted Desire is my second favorite movie My first is The Goonies But i still love Jeremy Jordan
hi im scott A K A woody7739 i Love the film Twisted Desire And i love watching Melissa Joan Hart on the t v as i think she is fine I am a real fan of sabrina the teenage witch too so this helped my watch it don t ask i love the way that nicole plans out her parents murder very carfully as she makes sure that someone else pulls the trigger and practices on the bottles so she wont give away her fingerprints a very well planned out idea back i guess it all backfired on nicole as she got caught as her old boyfriend comes along and puts a hidden camera under his shirt i give this film a nine out of ten and put it in MY top 10 films list And last but not least if anyone see s this film in the shops please tell me as i seen it on tv and didn t record it bye
WARNING minor spoilers br br I ran into this one partway through and watched from there not knowing what it was or what the plot was It certainly held my attention I didn t know until the ending that it was based on a true story The guy she used to do the dirty deed came out looking like a seriously nice guy who just got his head twisted around by a devious girl I have to question how true to life that portrayal is Anyone who would murder a husband and wife as they slept just can t be entirely nice Still I did have some sympathy for him as he had been set up and taken advantage of that much was made clear br br My main complaint is with the ending here comes the biggest spoiler skip this paragraph if you don t want to learn it A few minutes before it ended there seemed no way for the truth to be discovered The way it got discovered was in a sting operation but my question is how did the police get convinced to go along with it The movie didn t show us that and it seemed a bit too convenient absent the explanation of how they were persuaded to do it br br I think the way they handled that was done for dramatic purposes as the omission of the explanation lent an aura of suspense to the crucial scene which otherwise wouldn t have been there we would already have known what the scene was about and what was going on with Brad in it br br Otherwise this is a pretty good film I give it 7 10 It made me think Now I m interested to find out the facts of the real case br br One more thing the movie was done in 1996 Some of the reviews here seem to be treating it as a more recent movie br br P S Meadow Sisto is lovely I hadn t seen her before She can act a little too always a plus in her line of work LOL
The movie that i am going to review is a little television movie made in 1996 and it starred Melissa Joan Hart and Daniel Baldwin br br The main protagonist antagonist Jennifer Stanton Hart is a typical all American teenager who is feeling the pressure of having such a controlling father Baldwin However when she meets an ex con called Nick Ryan Jeremy Jordan Never been kissed they instantly fall for each other but Jennifer has a different idea on where to take their relationship she manipulates him to kill her parents to protect their love but she just used him to get rid of her parents so she can be with Brad David Lascher future Sabrina cast mate for Hart Melissa Joan Hart actually really surprised me with her role as an evil manipulator and she carries the movie well by using her friends and Nick so she can literally get away with murder The rest of the supporting cast work well and they each hold their own when they have screen time I also found it interesting that this film was made and released the same year Hart began portrayed Sabrina the Teenage Witch and this shows she can act in my genres of film and television br br Although the film has dated somewhat it stills stands out as some of her best work that involves drama or thriller and i am looking forward to Nine Dead that comes out in November because it shows she can seen as other people that are not called Clarissa Darling or Sabrina Spellman br br I recommend this film to anyone that is a fan of Melissa Joan Hart or Sabrina You can watch this on the internet so i suggest check it out
When I was flicking through the TV Guide and came across Twisted Desire on the movie section I read it s description Three words caught my eye Melissa Joan Hart I find her role in Sabrina The Teenage Witch absolutely vile I hate those kind of programs so I was just thinking that it was going to be a boring old love story starring her Little did I know br br It finally started on the television I had my bucket ready in case I were to puke over it s cheesiness or soppiness you know what I mean At first you think she s just a nice ordinary girl who s in love but has mean parents Then when you find out she s manipulated her boyfriend into killing her parents so she could be with her TRUE love you re like Whoa You just don t expect this sort of role for that sort of actress She played her role very well in my opinion I never expected her to be able to act like such a bitch and voil√† she did it perfectly Congrats to her the movie was very good I d definitely watch it again and recommend it to others
Twisted Desire 1996 was a TV movie starring Melissa Joan Hart Melissa s character Jennifer Stanton a seventeen year old seduces her current boyfriend Nick Ryan into murdering her two parents The movie is based on the 1990 murders of the parents of 14 year old Jessica Wiseman Jessica had her 17 year old boyfriend Douglas Christopher Thomas shoot and kill her parents Thomas was executed in 2000 Jessica was released from prison when she turned 21 years old Evidence now suggests that it was Jessica who fired the fatal shot that killed her mother Jessica is known to now be residing somewhere in the state of Virginia
I recently stumbled across this film on TNT five minutes into it while on vacation in Florida hey there has to be some down time in the hotel right I was initially surprised to see Melissa Joan Hart in any feature length film on TNT I mean Drive Me Crazy isn t THAT old already is it br br But I stuck with it and was thoroughly surprised and entertained Melissa plays her role as the psychotic Jennifer excellently The supporting cast Nick the ex con boyfriend Karen her best friend and her life controlling parents all added a great degree of believability The twist at the end was a nice closure to this tale of the girl who always seemed to be one step ahead of everybody br br If you get a chance check it out br br
Why am I so convinced there s actually another film version of this novel out there somewhere I saw the film again this year as I am teaching the novel and find the changes in the film annoying there is no appearance of the little boy in the novel and the ending has been changed They kill him off in the film but the whole point is that he is haunted by the events at Eel Marsh House for many years but does remarry and eventually put the events behind him Mr Bentley is a far more sympathetic character in the novel the scene in the film where Kipps sets fire to the office is plain daft and the constant appearance of the toy soldier to signify the presence of the child is genuinely creepy but pointless Kipps is haunted by the woman seeking revenge not the child I am sure I ve seen a film which is better and closer to the novel and actually scarier Have I just imagined this
The Woman In Black was a British made for TV movie which was first broadcast on the BBC on Christmave Eve of 89 and again in 92 I believe it made a round on American TV on A E It was released on VHS in Britain in the early 90 s but went out of print A U S company released it on DVD later but that version also sold out According to the website of the author of the book the rights to the movie are now owned by someone else and that it won t be released again and that there are unofficial bootlegs being sold on ebay br br I first heard about this movie just recently on a message board and had to check it out I found a copy on ebay for about 28 bucks It s certain to be a counterfeit from a seller in the far east even though the DVD says made in Canada ha ha But it s a good copy and you can t really fault the bootleg labels for releasing stuff that is rare out of print and lost in legal disputes br br I love the movie It s a period piece set in the 1920 s with all the very authentic and quaint British settings of that time The Woman In Black is very atmospheric and dark For the most part the movie is very low key but effective and scary There is no self indulgent gore violence or much at all in special effects but The Woman In Black is still able to create absolutely chilling moments It s a chilling classic styled ghost movie The movie itself looks like it could have been made in the 1930 s except for the color Without all the flash of all the modern horror movies I m afraid this film will always just be a lost gem For me it places itself as one of my all time favorites
Yes a true classic This is what British drama is all about realism and the minimal use of special effects and over inflated budgets I last saw this drama when it was last screened on British terrestial TV in 1994 It truly should be viewed by everyone who likes a scary plot no big names but non the less great acting Sadly the copywrite is now owned by someone unknown and as such this great drama is unlikely to be aired anytime soon I myself recently acquired The Woman In Black on VHS so now once again I shall be able to enjoy this truly great British drama You should try and enjoy it too br br Mark R Horobin
The Woman In Black is fantastic in all aspects It s scary suspenseful and so realistic that you can actually see it happening in real life I first saw this on the TV back in 1989 and with all the lights off and the volume turned up it was probably the most creepy experience of my entire life I managed to get hold of a copy and now I make sure to bring it out every Halloween and show it too unsuspecting family members who have no idea what they re in for and all I can do is laugh with glee As for the film br br It starts out with a young lawyer named Arthur Kipps who is assigned by his firm to go to the market town of Crythin Gifford to settle the papers of a recently deceased client Mrs Alice Drablow br br This film starts off as a reasonably solid and interesting ghost story But then Arthur attends the funeral and from that scene on we do not feel safe We are constantly on edge and biting our nails and that goes on for the next hour or so until the final thrilling finale br br A warning to all new viewers though do not watch this alone
A young solicitor from London Arthur Kidd is sent to a small coastal town of Crythin Gifford to oversee the estate of a recently passed away widow Mrs Drablow While attending her funeral a mysterious lady dressed in black catches his attention Supposedly Drablow lived a reclusive life and locals kept pretty quiet about her After this he heads to Mrs Drablow mansion that can only be reached on a causeway through the swamp during low tide There he encounters the woman in black again in cemetery out back of the house and things begin to get creepy as terrifying noises start coming from the marshes Now can Mrs Drablow s belongings and listening to her recorded dairy entries help Kidd figure out this gloomy mystery that the locals fear to talk about br br Often highly regarded amongst horror fans as being one of the most chilling ghost stories ever and I can see their point But only in doses does it draw upon tag Yes from what you can gather I was left a little under whelmed despite really liking it I was expecting goose bumps throughout the whole feature but that s probably it expecting Mainly I had a similar reaction with the 1980 haunted house thriller The Changeling When you hear so many good things it s sometimes hard not get caught up with it br br Anyhow what the British TV presentation of The Woman in Black effectively does is bring out a truly old fashion slow burn spine tingling premise driven by its moody locations disquieting atmosphere and first rate performances Subtly blankets the psychologically gripping story adapted off Susan Hill s novel of the same name as the simple mystery authentically opens up with a depressingly tragic tone and successfully characterises its protagonist Little seems to happen and can feel drawn out but the fragile randomness of it catch you off guard Whenever the camera focuses on the lady in black Who mostly appears as a background figure it s ultimately creepy She might not appear all that much but when she does Talk about unnerving That also goes for that downbeat conclusion Pauline Moran who plays the woman in black competently gets us nervous by just her gaunt appearance and sudden positioning A pale look and those minor mannerisms just seem to haunt you She s a spirit you don t want to cross paths with yet alone let her see you An accomplished performance by a marvelously moody Adrian Rawlins as the solicitor Arthur Kidd does hold it all together In support are solid turns by Bernard Hepton David Daker Clare Holman and David Ryall br br Drawing heavy on its lushly sombre rural town and foggy coastal locations adds more to the realistically eerie plight and the centre piece were everything unfolds in the forlorn time worn Victorian house that comprehensively suffocates the air with constant fear Director Herbert Wise carefully fabricates alarming imagery that slowly covers one secretive piece at a time in a smoothly paved out rhythm of well judged contriving Instead of going out to shock us some scenes contain a distressing intensity that won t let go The sound effects are masterfully used by surrounding and disorienting the air Rachel Portman s harrowing musical score knows how to get under your skin during those eerie moments and then stay with you br br This rarity made for television feat is a stimulating rich and unsettling supernatural spook fest It might not share much new to the sub genre but it competently sticks to it strengths to deliver what counts in this curse
This is a plain old spooky ghost story I showed it to some friends of mine in my movie club and they were kept spellbound until the ending No blood or gore just good old fashioned suspense It starts out right from the beginning and builds and builds The ending is a real twist that caught me unawares br br Well directed and well acted It is also a period piece set in the 1920s which added to the atmosphere br br I was so impressed I got the book by Susan Hill from Amazon The movie follows the book rather closely br br It s a shame it s not readily available on DVD My copy is VHS This along with Haunted are probably two of the best Ghost Stories I ve ever scene Which just goes to show that a little creativity outdoes in your face gore any day
as I was when I saw this movie I will never watch this movie again not because it is a bad movie but because it scared me so much As I said I was 14 when my English teacher decided to show it to us the reason for this is that we had read an extract from the book br br All the girls in my class were TERRIFIED when the Woman in Black comes through the window and floats over Kidd s bed although just before that there is something that also frightened us which was when Kidd finds the toy soldier underneath his pillow and he hears a child s voice say It s for you That scene still haunts me to this day nearly 7 YEARS after I saw the film br br If you are easily scared AVOID THIS FILM
On stage TV or in a book The Woman in Black is an outstanding ghost story Other reviewers have already said just about all there is to say about this film but I thought I would add my belated little review too The made for TV movie has a deliberately slow first act which chronicles the main character Arthur as he goes about his business as a solicitor in 1920s London I can understand why this might not appeal to all palates Nevertheless for me I love this British style of storytelling similar to any of the BBC s Ghost Story for Christmas adaptations of the great M R James work In the second act the ghost story kicks in as Arthur is sent to the provinces by his boss to tidy up the affairs of a deceased client The third act relentlessly builds up to a spine tingling conclusion As a Londoner I have seen the play I own the book DVD R and have the unabridged audio book on my iPod too What is sure for me The Women in Black on any medium is a ghost story with few equals It is about time that we had a legitimate region 2 DVD release
A young solicitor in sent to a remote area to wrap up the estate of a recently deceased client When he arrives he finds that he is made less than welcome by the local villagers and that his deceased client was not liked To speed things up he decides to move from the local inn and take up residence in her home a house that is usually fogbound and approached only by a causeway that is blocked off by the sea most of the day Once there he sees visions of a woman in black is she real or imaginary he is also subjected to the blood curdling cries of a woamn and child apparently drowning in the marshes these events take their toll on him and he soon becomes quite terrified Atmospheric TV adaptation of a famous play by Susan Hill that spends it first third building up its characters before moving to the creepy country house its poor colour contrast give away its TV roots immediately this really should have been in black white but still as a ghost story it had a couple of unsettling moments still though after waiting so long to see it I must say I was sadly just a little underwhelmed
I first watched this film when I was a kid and is the only time in my life that I can remember putting my hands over my face and eyes in utter horror at one particular scene I remembered it again with a disscusion with my uni friends and promptly bought it on video with plenty of hesitation I might add to my surprise I only found it on the web in the States when it was made in England When I watched it again my reaction and to my surprise was almost the same of sheer horror and fear and never has my heart been beating so much too This is in my opinon the SCARIEST film ever made Hollywood films seem tame in comparison and a bit Pony and Trap crap pardon the pun What is amazing though is the power of this film and at uni when watching this with about twenty of my associates I have never heard so many screams blokes as well Even the sight of the video brings the fear of God into me of that one particular scene and left me feeling that I will never walk alone again in the dark
There is nothing remotely scary about modern horror which is an insult to the word horror Freddie Vs Jason the Scream movies Cabin Trash and especially Stephen King s infantile attempts he s recycled every story from The Monkey s Paw to whatever often in the same story at horror in both writing and on film except for Kubrick s version of The Shining which actually was scary unlike King s books which are as frightening as my big toe the left one which still has the nail br br But The Woman In Black is that rare modern film that will make the hairs on the back of your neck stand on end This is the way it should be done the director creates tension and the scariest ghost ever actually seen simply by having her suddenly turn up standing still somewhere or other with that incredible look on her face Then he brings it all to a ghastly disturbing close He s learned his lessons from the masters who knew how to make horror Val Lewton original Cat People and Robert Wise a Val Lewton disciple and director of the Haunting and The Body Snatcher Jacques Tournier another Val Lewton disciple who directed a truly horrifying zombie film not the gross rubbish Raimi did gross isn t scary folks it s just gross and Lewis Allen The Uninvited and of course Jack Clayton s turn on Henry James The Innocents and the way the master of suspense Hitchcock can still bring you to the edge of your seat even with a slow building and burning period piece like Under Capricorn br br TEN STARS
The first and only time I saw the woman in black was I think the only time to my knowledge it appeared on TV back in 1989 It was Christmas eve and my father and i were watching it in the living room shortly before we all went to a midnight service in the village church I was quite young at the time but i m not sure who was more terrified walking through the church yard to the entrance of the church that night me or my father br br There are many factors about this film that make it so creepy but i think 0ne of them is the fact that there s not much in the way of a sound track that plays in the background of nearly every Hollywood movie so every creak thump and bang is more amplified in your head as there s no distraction Another factor that makes it different from other ghost stories there s no jump factor involved like things bouncing out the closet so it makes it not necessarily what you see but what you hear and what you think is going on This is a clever medium as nothing scares you more than your own mind running riot thinking whats around the corner or behind the door br br A superb ghost story I ve never seen anything that can match it and with all the dross thats repeated over and over on TV i cant believe the BBC has deleted it after to my knowledge only one showing
How much could the general Hollywood director learn from this movie All when it comes to actually scaring people This movies truly shows that it is possible to really frighten and scare a viewer and that monstrous monsters and long knifes never will be the best way of achieving this All who love a real psychological thriller must see this movie it is the best of it s kind
I gave this film an 10 10 with some reluctance as it s hard to praise something that so haunted and terrified me for years The sheer menace on the woman in black s face is just pure horror and the accompanying music just worsens the dread br br I saw this when it was first on TV when I was 10 and it really did disturb me for years I m fascinated by the fact that so many other users have said this too So many movie reviews go on about how disturbing or terrifying a film might be but you can believe all those who have posted on this board this really is incredibly powerful stuff I mean I really like horror films and generally find them quite funny more often than not but this really is menacing and will probably disturb most people I haven t seen it since I was 10 and I m tempted to watch it again but fear I might have some sleepless nights I can t quite put my finger on what it is exactly but I think it s something to do with the fact that fear is the Woman s greatest weapon and that we as viewers are just as susceptible as we feel the fear so intensely It s remarkable that other viewers feelings are so unanimous br br I ve also seen the stage play which was an excellent production but nothing can compare to this
Most horror movies are in fact horrible movies They get to be same ol same ol Same ol pack every minute with some cheap thrill usually splatter and nowadays they can pack every second with gaudy special effects One of the goals of a really good horror flick is to suspend the sense of disbelief of the audience For instance I saw both of the recent Mummy movies and nearly got dizzy viewing ridiculous special effects every second It probably costs a million dollars per second to make those movies and my sense of disbelief was never suspended it grew roots br br Subtlety can be more terrifying Less is more br br I first saw The Woman in Black on the A E channel After flipping through the usual 987 channels of very bad television I stopped to watch it This movie almost has the feel of a Masterpiece Theater production That was fine with me I ve always preferred British TV movies anyway br br Most viewers would find this to be too slowly paced But the slow pacing helps give the story credibility The special effects are few which lulls the viewer into thinking that this film is set in the real world thus making us a bit more uneasy The makeup and costume for the ghost are kept simple and believable Hollywood would have made her look like a she demon from hell with glowing eyes fangs claws etc Hollywood would have done an overkill and turned this idea into a mediocrity br br The woman only makes about five appearances in the film Most of them are where she appears in the distance and even that creates a good fright If she appeared too often it could ve cheapened the mood that gets set However this movie is so well made that through much of the film we re led into sensing that she is there the whole time but not visible The scene where she visits Arthur Kidd late at night and we see her just a little too close is a masterpiece in horror br br This is just an extraordinary film that I think should rate as one the finest horror films ever made I have a copy of The Haunting The Changling and a zillion more I haven t seen anything that tops The Woman in Black yet although I m still looking This movie is so well made that it gives even the most hardened skeptic like me a moment where I almost had second thoughts about the non existence of ghosts I joke to people that I occasionally get brief fears that she could appear standing in the middle of the road or that I d see her staring through my window etc Maybe she could be in a crowd at the mall glaring at me with her look of hate This is how a really great horror film should be Like a LaFanu novel The Woman in Black very slowly pulls you in and wraps herself around your neck and before you realize it she s squeezing the life out of you and then it s too late br br Closest thing I have to a criticism is that this was made for the small screen and it s a terrible shame that this is out of print I just paid over 40 for my second copy of this movie It s a major prize in my collection Now I m on a quest to find an even better horror movie that not only gives the chills but also qualifies a sound drama
This film gave me nightmares for months and I m 17 This is the scariest movie ever made That is no exaggeration I saw this movie at school in English lessons and no one else was scared which amazed me After reading other reviews I m glad I m not the only person who found this so scary
I saw this on TV so long ago that I can t remember when it was but it still stands out as one of the scariest most unnerving films I ve ever seen There is a simultaneously subtle but intense dread induced by the woman in black lurking at the edge of the frame not quite clearly visible so that you feel like the solicitor hero unsure whether its just imagination or not It is also one of the few films which has really made me fearful to keep watching Production values be hanged good films are about a director s ability to create atmosphere using film actors locations sets music attention to detail and imagination A real gem
Well done ghost story that will give you the creeps and some pretty fair scares along the way The story unfolds slowly building atmosphere all the way until you re ready to see the woman in black You won t forget her once you ve seen her No gore no knives no hockey masks just a well constructed story that is best viewed at night with the lights out
I first saw this movie here in the U K in December 1989 when Central TV broadcast it I still have the video tape although worn out over the years many friends and family members have borrowed it and have also been chilled by it br br Anyway I remember coming home that night grabbing a Christmas tipple switching the lights out and watching what was advertised as a Christmas Ghost Story Even now I remember certain scenes that still send the hairs on my neck standing on end br br I have seen some comments on the movie which say it s not this and not that I think those people get scared by Friday 13th and the like stalk and slash rammel which are laughable This is a traditional ghost story there is no big budget action or special effects no swearing no blood no gratuitous sex scenes no chainsaws or guns etc So how refreshing It s atmospheric IF you like chilling horror well written well acted and with a genuinely scary atmosphere this is the movie for you I like the original horrors only last night I saw the original Haunting and that is a superb movie Very atmospheric again and so is The Woman In Black The end of the movie differs to the book but still very good I recommend it Try it you will like it if you like traditional ghost stories SO turn off the lights turn up the fire lock the doors grab a drink and enjoy
I was lucky enough to watch this without any pre viewing hype I was surprised at the resilience of the ghost s image in my mind the next day and the day after that I ve watched it 3 4 times and each time I appreciate it even more The settings are gorgeous the town at dusk has beautiful lighting effects the marsh long shots and the house itself is sufficiently grown with moss The main hero is so likable and good natured that he is easily sympathized with To the person who complained that there wasn t enough spark in this film I d say that it s because the whole fight against the ghost is being waged by just this one person It is a fairly slow paced film with an unusual amount of time being spent pre and post ghost attack on developing his character with family and work life SPOILERS discussion br br I especially liked the turning point when he comes back to the main town and meets with the man helping him and explains about seeing the ghost He describes the Woman in black and then at the end of the conversation he says that he is going back because after all what harm had she done to him The other man says you can t go back alone and lends the hero his dog The cute little dog offers a small respite of comic relief with it s bounding through the house and even into the locked room br br The many casual appearances of the ghost really freaked me out The woman shows up in mid shot at the church showing that it is not afraid of the church and is also not shy or bound to the house This is all in the very beginning Another unbelievably memorable scene was with the kids outside of the church fence watching the funeral As the camera pans to the right the woman is seen in the background among the gravestones The older man won t even look at it but the kids are all yelling and taunting it Crreeepy Usually ghosts are hidden in shadows haunting specific locales or people As has been mentioned the ghost s malevolence and wrath are frightening and I feel it s attacks and the ending were perfect and fully justified The ending underlined the fact that the hero made a major mistake by going back to the house Or perhaps he was marked no matter what by saving the gypsy girl The guy who plays the hotel manager is so believable and really fills the role well I have been spreading the word to my friends about how much I enjoyed this film and it is reassuring to see others feel the same I can see how people don t quite see the same masterpiece especially if they went into it with a lot of review hype br br I think another person summed it up when they said that this movie settled the question of whether or not Ghosts could physically harm man Whew I plan to watch it again tonight followed by The Changeling aaww yeah Any other films to recommend br br Thanks
Whilst I have loved haunted house movies such as Amityville and Poltergeist this made for TV adaption of Susan Hills book packs a huge punch on the horrors of Hollywood br br With a brilliant cast many of which star in Heartbeat and other TV dramas great acting and fantastic setting which portrays 1920 s life convincingly it has all the right ingredients to entice the viewer into what is a powerful ghost story br br Herbert Wise did not need blood violence or gore to send chills down the spines of an audience Using your own imagination the Woman In Black is a figure of fear and dread and whose presence is never absent once she first appears br br The main character Arthur Kidd a solicitor learns about his unseen spectre on his mission to settle the estate The widow dies and Arthur spends few nights inside her dreary home in which he notices many oddities which may haunt him for some days Some of the scenes are very unsettling and claustrophobic particularly the locked room which opens itself which turns the generator off and closes Arthur in darkness The film becomes more harrowing the more you put yourself in Arthurs shoes and his efforts to shake this ghost off The writer puts many chilling additions into the story an example being the tin soldier s re appearance One is eager to learn the meaning of it all The fact we never really learn that much about the widow leaves more to the imagination and makes it all the more unsettling br br The widow for the most part looks vicious and intimidating The scene after winding the generator sent the chills down me a woman who appears out of nowhere on isolated marshy land with a howling wind having been on such properties myself I can appreciate how isolating this is And the scene in the inn was perhaps the most horrible things I ve seen one I don t wish to watch in a hurry or show to elderly relatives I have often woken up at night thinking she was behind me in my sleep br br The Woman In Black is a great TV movie and a lost gem I agree to some extent the Internet hype for this film has been totally overblown and can see why people were disappointed after spending the best of 50 on it but I think the net has defeated hidden gems because it makes films like these over exposed I think it s still brilliant and fantastically acted and I consider it the greatest ghost story of the last century
I saw this film on television years ago but here several years after I wake up in the morning and still remember her face br br This film is the most profoundly terrifying film I have seen
Spectacular Horror movie that will give you the chills once you get settled with it The atmosphere is very creepy and stylish the score is chilling but the best about the movie is it s performances It s rare to get scared by performances and this movie s solid acting plays an important part in the scare factor br br The story is very interesting and gets your attention since the first minutes Though the woman in black does not have much screen time she makes the necessary appearances to chill the audience in some brilliant scenes The dialogs are very descriptive and make your imagination work and that s when it becomes really scary br br If you have the chance watch this on theater it s a totally different experience but as scary as this movie br br This is one of the best Ghost movies ever and it s directed for people that want to get scared
I love ghost stories in general but I PARTICULARLY LOVE chilly atmospheric and elegantly creepy British period style ghost stories This one qualifies on all counts A naive young lawyer solicitor in Britspeak is sent to a small village near the seaside to settle an elderly deceased woman s estate It s the 1920s a time when many middle class Brits go to the seaside on vacation for their health Well guess what there s nothing healthy about the village of Crythin Gifford the creepy site of the elderly woman s hulking brooding Victorian estate which is located on the fringes of a fog swathed salt marsh When the lawyer saves the life of a small girl none of the locals will help the endangered tot you find out why later on in the film he inadvertently incurs the wrath of a malevolent spirit the woman in black She is no filmy gauzy wraith but a solid black silhouette of malice and evil The viewer only sees her a few times but you feel her malevolent presence in every frame As the camera creeps up on the lawyer while he s reading through legal papers you expect to see the woman in black at any moment When the lawyer goes out to the generator shed to turn on the electricity for the creepy old house the camera snakes in on him and you think she ll pop up there too Waiting for the woman in black to show up is nail bitingly suspenseful We ve seen many elements of this story before the locked room that no one enters the fog the naive outsider who ignores the locals warnings but the director somehow manages to combine them all into a completely new seeming and compelling ghost story Watch it with a buddy so you can have someone warm to grab onto while waiting for the woman in black
I really miss the production of good old fashion Spooky films If Ismail Merchant and James Ivory had been given the task of producing such a film it may have been this one save for the lack of an internationally known top drawer cast This is one of those films that you watch alone on a dark evening with a pizza and some popcorn and you don t even bother doing the dishes until morning because you just want to hide under the covers Bravo to Director Herbert Wise Writers Susan Hill and Nigel Kneale top Production design by Jon Bunker Art Direction by John Ralph and an excellent cast for making me shudder and feel so isolated even though I m living in one of the most populated cities in the world in the beginning of the 21st Century I gave it a 9 out of 10 because with the production and budget constraints of television they really pulled of a great show
Every once in a while in the wonderful world of horror diamonds are crafted and one becomes completely awestruck by its sheer brilliance This is no less than a diamond This is a film brimful of eeriness chilling anticipation and dark atmosphere and I think it s safe to say one of my favourite horror films of all time And of course it contains probably the single most flat out scary sequence in the whole of history of horror Every time I see the film and it gets up to the point where you know the inevitably will happen I try to remember exactly when I will be frightened out of my wits but it never fails to happen I never get it right and I find myself as terrorized as the first time I saw it Now it must be said to scare a jaded horror fan like that that is nothing short of pure perfection Unlike the Americans the Brits know their subtleties they take pride in the art of acting they do not need any special effect in order to convey atmosphere they rely on the power of the potent story and the creepiness in this case of suggestion and anticipation Every single element is impeccable from the set pieces the acting the story to the menacing atmosphere Pauline Moran surely could make the devil whimper that s for sure As an end note if you for some demented reason don t like this piece of insanity then you honestly don t know what horror is all about and frankly do not deserve to know it either Thank you
This film has been scaring me since the first day I saw it br br My Mum had watched it when it was on the telly back in 92 I remember being woken up in the middle of the night by her tearful ramblings as my Dad helped her up the stairs br br She was saying something like Don t let her get me or something like that I asked what had made her so upset and she told me that she d been watching The Woman in Black br br So obviously i had to watch it and even though i was only eleven she let me It scared the s out of me I ve been immune to horror films since watching this
The Woman in Black 1989 is a TV adaptation of Susan Hill s modern classic ghost story published only a few years earlier than the film was made Sadly this film has not been released on DVD and as far as I am aware it has been deleted on VHS It s availability is in direct contrast to it s popularity amongst those in the know about horror films The story revolves around events in a seaside community in the early 20th century where a young solicitor is sent by his firm to conclude the affairs of a recently deceased widow who died on her isolated marshland estate What he thought would be a routine and probably tedious task turns into a nightmare as he discovers that the old woman was haunted to her death and that the ghosts of her past are not content to rest The story is told in a subtle but concise way never being self indulgent flashy or over expositional The obviously tight budget may have contributed to the no nonsense approach but it s just what the story needs and why it works so well It s what you don t see that scares Having said that there is one particularly terrifying scene that relies on the visual and it works to perfection I watched this film during the day and it still gave me nightmares nearly a week later If you love being terrified do what you must to get hold of and watch a copy of The Woman In Black
The Woman in Black is easily one of the creepiest British ghost stories ever made A young solicitor after arriving in a small town to handle a dead client s estate is haunted by a mysterious woman dressed all in black The film is loaded with extremely eerie atmosphere and the frights are calculated for and deliver the maximum effect possible The action keeps the viewer deeply involved and the finale is quite disturbing The acting is excellent and the tension is almost unbearable at times So if you want to see a truly creepy horror film give this one a look I dare anyone to watch The Woman in Black alone at night with the lights off Highly recommended 10 out of 10
Insignificance is a far from great film from a stage play directed by Nic Roeg In the scheme of Roeg s films this is above the level of most of his post Don t Look Now work which is characterised by judicious use of Theresa Russell as lead actress She s actually very good here and far from the problem in other Roeg films like Bad Timing and Cold Heaven As the Actress who is Marilyn Monroe Russell is very effective portraying her as a thoroughly depressive but likeable siren She plays well alongside Michael Emil as Einstein who is excellent to say the least He looks the part admirably and while Theresa Russell doesn t look exactly like Monroe she certainly is attractive enough to make the part ring true Other players are adequate if not quite as arresting as Emil and Russell are A pretty workable intelligent script is directed well by Roeg but certainly not brilliantly like Walkabout or Performance As in other later Roeg films he tends to rely too much on vague insubstantial flashbacks that add very little to the film In many ways the film would have worked better as a shorter say 60 minutes more modest piece Still a quite acceptable passable film At times quite excellent but somewhat lacking overall Rating 1 2
It is not known whether Marilyn Monroe ever met and spoke with Albert Einstein and since the mysterious disappearance of her diary after her equally mysterious death we may never know but in their lifetime the opportunity was there br br Scripted by Terry Johnson from his own play Nicolas Roeg s Insignificance imagines an encounter in a New York hotel room one night in 1953 between the two icons plus Joe DiMaggio Busey and Senator Joseph McCarthy Curtis but only on one level On another level it elevates or reduces these personalities and what a lousy phrase that is to mere avatars the characters are deliberately unnamed at once greater and lesser in status br br The title Insignificance is both apposite and deeply ironic here DiMaggio s net worth has been reduced to little more than a picture on a bubblegum card Monroe too is reduced to her constituent parts of dress hair lipstick wiggle and voice By uncovering their insecurities and reversing their roles the film brings into sharp focus received notions of celebrity exploding the cult of personality br br Furthering the theme there will be another explosion at the film s climax Hiroshima in a hotel suite in which The Actress is burned to a cinder in seconds a literal deconstruction of fame Goodbye Norma Jean History informs the script which in turn shakes history upside down As Roeg mused after watching Johnson s play for the first time These characters were mythic not invented by any single person not the public or the press probably not even by the characters themselves As played by Theresa Russell Marilyn a closet intellectual in real life lectures a childlike Einstein The Professor played by Emil on the theory of relativity using balloons and a flashlight while getting The Professor to show off his legs in conscious parody of her own role in The Seven Year Itch the movie The Actress is seen to be working on in the film s opening br br History records that Monroe s then husband fading baseball star DiMaggio played by Busey as a tenderly psychotic simpleton was unhappy about her iconic dress splaying scene in the film precipitating their break up Right on cue we discover the jealous Ballplayer in a bar bemoaning the fact that if I want to see her underwear I just walk down to the corner like all the other guys br br In contrast to The Professor The Ballplayer believes the universe is round a contention shared by Native Americans But the Big Chief Sampson of One Flew Over The Cuckoo s Nest fame who operates the Roosevelt Hotel s elevator has been all but disenfranchised from his own culture I no longer Cherokee I watch TV Meanwhile The Senator is investigating The Professor who is on the eve of delivering a pacifist speech to the United Nations but whom The Senator suspects is a Red In fact as he divulges to Monroe Einstein is wracked with guilt over Hiroshima and what the white heat future holds Yet in a seemingly godless universe all such worries and aspirations are rendered insignificant in the light of a higher atomic power br br Roeg really is the perfect director to bring Johnson s stage play to the screen Throughout tortured childhood flashbacks and pessimistic flash forwards ka boom draw unexpected connections between time place and circumstance with the repeated visual motif of a wristwatch employed to mark time s passing but perhaps also to suggest all time is one time each moment co existing As evinced by his back catalogue it s something of a hobbyhorse for a director enchanted with the notion of synchronicity see Don t Look Now in particular Here 1920 bleeds into 1945 and drip feeds into the 1980s a period in which another Actor has taken on his greatest role as the President of the United States br br If all this sounds rather heavy going quantum physics is surely involved the execution is anything but owing to Johnson s witty zippy screenplay Roeg s playful direction opening out an essentially stagey set up and the cast themselves who are on stellar form Tony Curtis especially leaves denture marks in the wood panelling as the paranoid impotent Senator who is seen attempting congress with a Monroe impersonator a real one as opposed to Russell s before being let down by his dwindling member br br Of course Curtis once co starred with the real Marilyn Monroe in Some Like It Hot and whose embrace he memorably described as like kissing Hitler As Roeg commented Everything suddenly seemed connected when the film began to take shape even the actors themselves seemed part of this endless linking It all goes into the pot to be boiled down and served up in new and fascinating ways
New York 1953 One hot night four famous iconic figures will come together The professor Albert Einstein has come to NY to give a speech which he has the senator Joesph MacCarthy on his back Later that night his gets a surprise visitor a famous actress Marilyn Monroe Who actually wants to discuss the theories of Relativity Soon her ball playing husband Joe DiMaggio turns up at the hotel room begging to work things out for their crumbling relationship Flashbacks of childhood important events perceived consequences of their actions creep in to show how these individuals cope with despair and a hidden fear waiting to break out br br Now that s one of a kind Adapted off a stage play by Terry Johnson who would also script the screenplay for the film Insignificance is an odd quirky seductive and downright curious fictional pop culture gimmick in the hands of director Nicolas Roeg This inspired and cerebral experimental effort might be rooted in its stage play origins because it does feel theatrical and most of the action occurs in a hotel backdrop and one main suite The cramp look only enhanced the moody and smoky atmosphere of New York to great effect However these limitations can t contain the fruitful and daring ideas that Roeg manages to randomly storm up visually and through the meaningful material The way he reflects on the characters who are suggestively famous figures without the need of naming of them philosophical journeys and interpretations of their notions is stimulating in a spiritual sense with the memories gelling into the present and visions showing their fears of realisations which depending on what you re seeing is either beautiful or hauntingly implemented There s plenty of food for thought and hints within the verbosely innovative if sometimes awkward script with the main focus concerning the present situation but the flashbacks gives us the personal make up sex power enlightenment and glory of what makes them who they are and how much of a burden it can be in there already demanding lives Sure the story might not lead to anything by the end and it can feel disjointed but the dreamy vibe and intelligent arrangement irons out those folds and makes sure it never turns giddy Peter Hannan s sensually fluid photography and Stanley Myers titillatingly oozing blues soundtrack fit in snugly with Roeg s stylistically subdue and established style of directing He makes it look like he s working with something big and large scale but otherwise that s not the case and a small little universe is created The vintage costumes and locations of the period all come off fittingly enough What made the film for me had to be the impressive acting it boasted from the main four Theresa Russell s perky drop dead gorgeous appeal of the sexy pin up actress is a growing portrayal that definitely held the film together along with an genuinely excellent and endearing performance by Michael Emil as the professor Tony Curtis marvellously plays it up as witch hunting senator and Gary Busey is suitably good in the stoically gravel manner as the ballplayer Showing up in minor but amusing support roles happen to be Will Sampson and Patrick Kilpatrick br br A memorably striking fresh and tour de force meditation piece of metaphysics linked together by four different extremes Some might find it pretentiously estrange and too talky but this one had me wrapped up in its own little unique world to worry too much about its shortcomings
If you have any sort of appreciation for character and dialogue and any sense of American cultural history you will find a lot of very absorbing material in this film It probably was originally a play and that s why it s dialogue heavy but I can t stress enough how these icons that we only have a shallow understand of are made into truly complex and wonderful characters br br This film is better than any college course for telling you how to create a character driven story br br
Yes it s flawed especially if you re into Hollywood films that demand a lot of effects a purely entertaining or fantasy story or plot and you can t actually think for yourself br br Roeg s films are for the intelligent film goer and Insignificance is a perfect example br br The characterizations are brilliant the story is excellent but like all Nic Roeg s films it has you thinking on every level about aspects of reality that would never have dawned on you before His films always make you think and personally I like that in a film br br So don t expect to come away from watching this film and feeling all happy happy because it s likely you ll be disappointed br br But I think it s excellent
I have always been a great admirer of Nicolas Roeg and Walkabout is one of my favorite films This is a film version of Roegs stage play and while most of the film takes place in a hotel room it still has some of Roegs cinematic flare Very unique story is about a famous actress Theresa Russell who after a hard nights work on a film in 1954 goes to a hotel to visit a famous professor Michael Emil and together in his hotel room they talk After awhile she wants to go to bed with him but as they start to get undressed her husband is banging on the door Her husband is a famous ex baseball player Gary Busey and he wants to know what is going on The three of them in the hotel room talk about what is going on and what the future holds for them Meanwhile a famous senator Tony Curtis is threatening to take away the professors papers if he doesn t testify at a hearing Theresa Russell is just excellent and while she s not trying exactly to impersonate Marilyn Monroe she does a wonderful job of exuding the phobia s and nuances that Monroe is very well known for One thing the film does is show her as not only a woman on the verge of a mental breakdown but show her as a physical wreck as well She talks of being unable to have children and at one point in the film she suffers a miscarriage You can make an excellent case that this is Russell s best performance and I probably wouldn t argue The film does an interesting thing in showing many flashbacks as the characters continue to talk about one thing and in the flashback we see one of many reasons for their actions Busey also gives a good solid performance and it reminds me of what a strong persona he gives off on screen Emil as the professor is a character that has many more things on his mind then we originally thought The last scene in this film is a demonstration of his darker side One of the highlights of the film for me is the little conversation he has with the elevator man Will Sampson of Cuckoo s Nest and they discuss what Cherokee Indians think about at all times But of course the famous scene in this film is where Russell demonstrates to Emil how she does understand the theory of relativity and uses toys to show this The professor is delighted by her demonstration and so are we Russell and Roeg are married in real life and they do admirable work when they are in collaboration and this is probably their best film together Good performances and a very interesting job of directing make this a challenging and visually thought provoking film
Nicolas Roeg s projects are variable to say the least but are never less than interesting Insignificance is obviously first and foremost an adapted stageplay it s wordy and pretty much room bound BUT it pays to view this film more than once the underlying themes are not overtly presented and what s more it takes a while to adjust to the juxtaposition and role reversals of the four protagonists Einstein McCarthy Munroe and DiMaggio br br Einstein is wracked by guilt over Hiroshima yet fancies the simplicity of a sexual liaison with Munro Munro is sick of being seen as a bimbo and craves intellectual credence Senator McCarthy is at the height of his witch hunting powers but is an impotent sleazebag DiMaggio is insecure about his celebrity self obsessed and prone to violence Each of them contains the seeds of their own destruction Each character has a troubled abused abusive past and a questionable future Gradually we see that obsession itself is the central theme America s obsession with its postwar cultural icons and mores the obsessions of the protagonists for something none can have peace of mind and or happiness br br Compared with the theory of relativity a proposed unified field theory and indeed the cosmos itself all the aspirations and interactions of Roeg s protagonists seem insignificant Yet these aspects of the physical universe it s all quantum trust me affect us when they are applied to the development of the means to destroy us Monroe s mention of the principle behind the neutron bomb without naming it as such is not an anachronism per se but can only be understood by a contemporary audience Indeed ALL the references within the script are only accessible to a knowledgeable viewer one au fait with 50s occurrences personality cults and how they affect us in the 21st century br br This film and its screenplay are either very very clever or extremely opaque and pretentious Ultimately however probably insignificant br br live long and prosper br br
What if Marylin Monroe Albert Einstein Joe Dimaggio and Senator McCarthy were to come together in a mind bending evening of relativity br br This delightful roman √† clef never uses the actual names of the characters it so thinly veils and scathingly exposes not only for the individuals they must have been but also for what they came to represent over time If you are confused by allegory or if you like your movies served up predigested and mushy you won t like this film It is a demanding opus that rewards on many levels the viewer with the intelligence to appreciate it br br Dropping for the time being the rigorous avoidance of using the real names of the characters we see Einstein about to deliver a pacifist speech to a United Nations hell bent for nukes being visited by Marylin Monroe after filming the notorious Seven Year Itch scene that some say led to the end of her marriage with Joe Dimaggio They have a lovely interplay in which Einstein stumbles with suitable professorial clumsiness around the innocence of perhaps the greatest sex symbol of modern times br br Enter Senator McCarthy who thinks Einstein is a Red He is determined to extract Einstein s assurance that he will support the activities of the House Unamerican Activities Committee while delivering the ultimate weapon in the name of peace Add Joe a surprisingly fragile and vulnerable person perhaps not perfectly cast as Gary Busey who hates Marylin s exhibitionism and believes Einstein has become her lover even though Marylin only wants to show Einstein that she understands the Special Theory of Relativity br br But there s more br br Just like each of us these characters have their deepest fears which they reveal one by one in haunting flashbacks It is these weaknesses ultimately that lend humanity to figures we cannot help but see almost exclusively in the abstract today Finally we see the shocking terror of Einstein s vision and the statement of the movie becomes clear It is a powerful and memorable moment br br Insignificance is one of my top five movies of all time It is utterly amazing
A lovely little B picture with all the usual Joe Lewis touches people ripping up pillows and auras of lurking fear Also alas an ending that comes out of nowhere because apparently the auteur has lost interest in the movie or perhaps because as a B picture it has to fit into a slot
Joseph H Lewis was one of the finest directors of film noir This is surely his best br br It doesn t have some of the standard features of what we now call film noir Though American made it is set entirely in England It lacks gangsters It lacks a femme fatale It does not lack crime br br The title character answers an ad She is overjoyed that she ll be making some money as a secretary Instead she wakes up days later as the pawn in a frightening plot Only a very strong person could survive such a terrifyingly unsettling ordeal And Nina Foch gives the sense of a strong woman as Julia br br Part of the excitement comes from casting against type Ms Foch has an elegant manner She is no screaming cowering victim She is actually a bit icy and patrician albeit impecunious This makes her character s plight all the more believable br br Surely the single most fascinating element is the casting of Dame May Witty She was and is probably most famous for the charming title character in The Lady Vanishes She has a sweet manner and a harmless slightly dithering manner But here she is far from a heroine br br George Macready is excellent as her extremely troubled son The whole cast in fact is superb br br It seems that this famous and brilliant movie was made almost by accident Undoubtedly the director knew exactly what he was doing But he did it on a low budget That is the thrill and charm of film noir the real film noir It is small convincingly lowlife and in this case unforgettable
Nina Foch insists that My Name is Julia Ross in this 1945 film noir also starring Dame May Witty and George Macready It s short and because it is the film suffers It could have stood to have been a good fifteen minutes to a half hour longer br br When I was growing up Foch was a fixture on television playing a neurotic woman the wife with the cheating husband the nervous wreck She became one of the great acting teachers in Los Angeles Here she s a pretty young ingenue playing the title role Julia answers an ad for a secretary and is hired immediately by Mrs Hughes and her son Ralph Little does she know though we learn immediately that the employment agent is a front set up to get just the right woman for this assignment a woman with no family and no boyfriend br br It s a live in situation once Julia gets to the house she s drugged and when she wakes up she s told she s Mrs Hughes and not allowed to leave br br The acting is very good Low budget but still entertaining some things particularly at the end happen way too quickly which is why I said the movie is too short Nevertheless I recommend it
This was a typical grade B movie in 1940s Hollywood and yet it succeeded way beyond its expectations Why It has a wonderful plot and backed up by Nina Foch George MacReady and Dame May Witty as a female villain of all people br br When a young lady answers an advertisement for a secretary she certainly gets more than she bargained for The only talents her employers are seeking are those which will lead to her demise Seems that Witty and MacReady want to pass her off as their daughter in law and wife respectively MacReady killed his real wife and wants to do Foch in as well so that a body can be claimed br br The film deals with how Foch tries to get town people to believe her and how she is thwarted in practically everything she does Why don t people believe her
Greatly enjoyed this 1945 mystery thriller film about a young woman Nina Foch Julia Ross who is out of work and has fallen behind in her rent and is desperate to find work Julia reads an ad in the local London newspaper looking for a secretary and rushes out to try and obtain this position Julia obtains the position and is hired by a Mrs Hughes Dame May Witty who requires that she lives with her employer in her home and wants her to have no involvement with men friends and Julia tells them she has no family and is free to devote her entire time to this job George Macready Ralph Hughes is the son of Mrs Hughes and has some very strange desires for playing around with knives This was a low budget film and most of the scenes were close ups in order to avoid the expense of a background and costs for scenery This strange family all live in a huge mansion off the Cornwall Coast of England and there is secret doors and plenty of suspense
MY NAME IS JULIA ROSS is a mesmerizing 1945 B thriller from Joseph H Lewis arguably one of the very finest directors of Hollywood noir films This 65 minute Gothic oddity from Columbia Pictures came after Lewis lengthy apprenticeship as the helmer of a string of poverty row westerns East Side Kids comedies horror melodramas including the incredibly bizarre Bela Lugosi shocker THE INVISIBLE GHOST and standard studio B product SECRETS OF A CO ED BOMBS OVER BURMA THE FALCON IN SAN FRANCISCO etc all of which set the stage rather nicely for what was to come from the enormously talented and inventive Mr Lewis MY NAME IS JULIA ROSS as well as SO DARK THE NIGHT from the following year introduced a director who had mastered the rare and delicate art telling a dark and probing tale swiftly and efficiently on the most modest of budgets Later Lewis productions like GUN CRAZY 1949 and THE BIG COMBO 1955 despite the expanded scope of their narrative structure continued to rely upon deft lucid camera work and effective low key lighting And very modest resources br br MY NAME IS JULIA ROSS probably owes more to the tradition of British mysteries it s set in a studio bound England than it does to conventional film noir attitudes and trappings A young woman Nina Foch agrees to take a position in the home of an elderly woman Dame Mae Witty Two days after her arrival she awakens from a deep sleep in a completely strange house and mysteriously enough with a brand new identity that of the old woman s daughter in law Told that she s been the victim of a nervous breakdown she struggles to grasp the utter and seemingly hopeless nature of her predicament But before long she begins to piece together the strange and troubling truth behind this dark mystery that her husband the always menacing George Macready most probably murdered his real wife and that she s been duped into participating in a harrowing and sinister scheme Much of what distinguishes this otherwise modest tale are the indelible touches that Lewis brings to the production marking it as the first of his truly serious endeavors as a film director
For those who think of Dame May Witty as the kindly slightly batty old lady from Hitchcock s The Lady Vanishes this movie requires an adjustment Here she s anything but kindly or batty Instead her son George Macready is the loony one Just don t give him a knife otherwise his eyes light up and no furniture cushion in the house is safe Now we know what he has in mind for the trapped Nina Foch if he can just get out from under Mother s domineering hand br br Really tight little woman in danger film that keeps the suspense on high throughout The script never strays from Foch s dilemma She s held prisoner in a big old Gothic house on the edge of an angry sea They re going to kill her but why Her predicament makes no sense The tension mounts as she tries one escape ploy after another but even strangers seem against her We begin to feel her helplessness and mounting paranoia as the world turns away from her br br Director Joseph H Lewis took a big step toward cult status with this film and understandably so Then too watch Foch run subtly through a gamut of emotions without once going over the top Witty too shines as a really intimidating matriarch who knows what she wants and how to get it if she can just keep her wacko son in line My one reservation is the climax which seems too contrived considering the timing of the events Nonetheless it s a good nerve wracking way to spend a little over an hour courtesy Columbia studios
Julia Ross Nina Foch agrees to take a position as a secretary with the rich Hughes family to get over her boyfriend leaving her Almost immediately she is drugged and shipped off to the family s estate in Cornwall When she awakens they keep telling her she s Marion Hughes has been mentally ill and keep her locked up but why You ll probably guess why but won t mind because this one is fun br br Along with The Narrow Margin and Face Behind the Mask this is one of the best B pictures ever made B pictures were low budget pictures made quickly with low budgets and no major stars It s just as long as it needs to be only 65 minutes is well directed fast paced and exciting It only stumbles at the end which I found a bit too implausible to buy br br Foch a good actress is just OK in the lead but Dame May Witty is great and George Macready is excellent and frightening as the villains Well worth catching A perfect example of how you can make a great movie on a small budget
Nina Foch delivers a surprisingly strong performance as the title character in this fun little Gothic nail biter She accepts a position as secretary to a London society dowager played imperiously by Dame May Witty and her creepy son the effete and bothersome George Macready Before she knows it she awakens to find herself in a seaside manor she s never seen before where Witty and Macready are calling her Marian and trying to convince the servants and the nearby townspeople that she s Macready s mad wife Of course this pair can only be planning dastardly deeds and even though we know Julia has to eventually escape her trap director Joseph Lewis builds real suspense in answering the question of just how she ll manage it br br My Name Is Julia Ross has nothing stylistically to set it apart from any number of films that came out at the same time period but I was surprised by how well it held together despite its shoe string budget and B movie pedigree There are quite a few moments that just may have you on the edge of your seat and I found myself really rooting for Julia as she caught on to the scheme underfoot and began to outsmart her captors In any other Gothic thriller the heroine would have swooned screamed and dithered waiting for her hero to come and save her So I can t tell you how refreshing it was to have the heroine in this film use her brain and figure out how to save herself br br Well done br br Grade B
Having watched this film strictly on the strength of reviewers ratings I was most pleasantly surprised Although clearly low budget it bears the signs of clever ingenuity For example when Julia wakes in the strange house and looks out the window I found myself thinking that her sense of isolation would be enhanced with an exterior shot focused on her face and then moving backwards to include the house and its isolated location And lo and behold the next scene was exactly that last shot of the house standing lonely on the cliff at the water s edge There are other examples of how a clever director can elevate his film to the level of a very enjoyable thriller Savvy viewers will surely spot them but should rest assured they will not be disappointed br br As to the performances George Macready is his usual creepy self barely maintaining his composure while suggesting a capacity for unadulterated violence Nina Foch was surprisingly good as the no nonsense working girl who s not about to submit without a fight But Dame May Witty oh boy she even had me doubting my own eyes and believing she could get away with her evil schemes br br This a real diamond in the rough and not to be missed
Second feature concerns a young woman in London desperate for a job happy to accept live in secretarial position with an elderly woman and her son Thrillers about people being held in a house against their will always make me a little uneasy I end up feeling like a prisoner too but this rather classy B film is neither lurid nor claustrophobic It s far fetched and unlikely but not uninteresting and our heroine Nina Foch is quick on her feet Rehashing this in 1986 as Dead Of Winter proved not to be wise as the plot elements are not of the modern day Julia Ross is extremely compact too short at 65 minutes but it stays the course nicely until a too rushed climax which feels a little sloppy from
A toothsome little potboiler whose 65 minute length doesn t seem a second too short My Name is Julia Ross harks back to an English tradition of things not being what they seem Hitchcock s The Lady Vanishes is one example Out of work Julia Ross Nina Foch finds a dream job at a new employment agency in London whose sinister representative seems very anxious to ascertain if she has living relatives or a boyfriend After reporting to duty she wakes up Having Been Drugged in a vast Manderley like pile on the Cornish coast supposedly as the barmy in the crumpet wife of George Macready who displays an alarming interest in knives and ice picks His doting enabling mum is the irresistible Dame May Whitty this time a model of bustling efficiency on the other side of good vs evil than she occupied in The Lady Vanishes The nightmare vision of this tale unfolds claustrophobically we know what s going on but are powerless to tell poor Julia This movie curiously is regularly accorded a place of honor as one of the earliest and very few British films noirs I think it s closer to the Gothic old dark house tradition than the American one of wet cobblestones and urban corruption it does however evince a more modern psychoanalytic cast of mind Whatever you call it it remains a sharply satisfying thriller
Shirley MacLaine in another tailor made role As the aunt to a single mom in a 1962 working class Chicago neighborhood the veteran character actress gets another work out as a gutsy woman who won t let any set backs defeat her spirit of success The children a pre teen boy and girl are drawn to their spirited Aunt Zoe although the many magic tricks and practical jokes learned from her and applied at all the wrong opportunities eventually get them expelled from school br br The plot is cleverly enveloped in the Cuban Missile Crisis with all of the social implications Men building bomb shelters people watching news programs on what seemed to be the only TV set at a diner and a general mist of uneasiness and fear in the air When a harmless miracle is blown out of proportions the climactic conclusion nonetheless makes the viewer feel good Yes Virginia the sun will come up tomorrow Clearly a small budget production this is still a sweet little film filled with the magic that Sunday Matinees were made of With a few choice Oldies thrown into an effective Sound Track the whole family is sure to enjoy this one
Wonderful family drama comedy starring MacClaine and Garr that entertains and warms the heart every time I see it Strongly recommended for all ages from 9 year olds to grannies Lovely period piece capturing 1962 The story encompasses the struggling Garr her two children and Aunt Zena MacClaine trying to make ends meet without a man as head of the household The family heads west to take the inheritance of a long forgotten relative that has left Garr a run down ramshackle road side cafe right out of the late 1940 s The tenacious Garr as the sweet but determined mom gets the whole family into the restoration and opening of the cafe But wait Aunt Zena is an old circus performer with card tricks magic powders and a jesters sense of humor she loves to get the kids and her into silly and sometimes dangerous games What happens next is a delightful combination of Miracle at Lords thrown together with the Cuban missile crises with authentic TV news from the real event and a ghost prank that gets totally out of hand This film entertains philosophizes questions religiosity and gives an unnerving glimpse of the frightening scare of October 1962 s Cuban missile crises In the end one is left with the wonder of faith family and rediscovered love Oh and the music from the era of the early 60 s is just great br br Recommend STRONGLY as a FEEL GOOD FILM 10 out 10
I took a chance on Hardcastle and McCormick by purchasing the first season s worth Canadian release from Amazon When I got it I started with the pilot and I was instantly hooked after that I rated it 5 stars on Amazon and I am rating it 10 stars here It is just that good What I liked about it were the opening and closing themes and of course Stephen J Cannell s logo at the end of each episode but most of all the relationship between the Judge and Mark as they worked together to crack each case I was so hooked that I also purchased the second season as a companion and I enjoyed it equally If you do not have this excellent series on disc I believe that you should purchase it and put it in your collection
Hardcastle and McCormick is an excellent TV show br br Yes it is predictable much like The Dukes of Hazzard Hunter The A Team etc etc etc br br This show is just good clean television The relationship between Hardcastle and McCormick is quite amusing They often take jabs at each other several times an episode which adds a great deal of humor to the show It contains several car chases in almost every episode but who doesn t enjoy a good car chase Especially with the Coyote br br I only wish they made clean television like this today I highly recommend this
br br Film dominated by raven haired Barbara Steele it was seen when I was seven or eight and created permanent images of pallid vampiric men and women stalking a castle seeking blood Steele is an icon of horror films and an otherworldly beauty and the views of the walking dead pre date Romero s NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD shamblers unifying them in my mind br br I don t see the connection between this film and THE HAUNTING which is clever but ambiguous about the forces present LA DANZA MACABRE is a b movie without pretention daring you to fall in love with Barbara Steele and suffer the consequences There s no such draw to HAUNTING s overwrought Claire Bloom The comparisons to the HAUNTING are superficial br br And no this movie does NOT need to be remade Not only is it a product of the Sixties but the large percentage of talentless cretins in Hollywood cannot fathom MACABRE s formula for terror That formula is based on one overriding factor GOOD WRITING Low grade classics like CASTLE and Corman s Poe films with R Matheson and Tourneur s OUT OF THE PAST share a commonality of strong writing It s simple Get a real writer like Richard Matheson or Steve McQuarrie and let them put a plot into today s cinematic mess Besides that let Hollywood attempt some original material for a change and stop exploiting the obviously superior product of the past
I saw this film when I was 10 or 11 years old alone in my parent s basement on a Saturday night It was being shown on Chiller Theatre a regular fright feature that I watched religiously as a young un Now I have seen many old horror films thanks to Chiller Theatre but none ever stuck with me like Danse Macabre a k a Castle of Blood I am 51 now and only last year was I fortunate enough to locate a relatively recent quality DVD edition of this wonderfully shudder inducing supernatural classic having thought I d never manage to see it again I have already watched it four more times and cannot seem to get tired of it br br They just don t make spook films like this one anymore Haunted catacombs and mist enshrouded graveyards just don t work as well in color as they did in black and white back in the day Anyway this one has Edgar Allen Poe and Barbara Steele deliciously shadowy cobweb wrap ed haunted castle sets restless spirits re enacting their deaths and a wickedly ironic ending br br IMO this one s right up there with Robert Wise s The Haunting The Innocents with Deborah Kerr and the more recent The Others
Castle of Blood aka Castle of Terror is a well crafted surprisingly spooky entry from Italian director Anthony Dawson Exquisite black and white cinematography flawless dubbing superb casting fairly logical scripting deliberate pacing and a surprise though totally appropriate ending set this one apart Only the films sometimes hokey music and the rather abrupt love at first sight between Elizabeth Barbara Steele and Alan Georges Rivi√®re mar an otherwise surprisingly entertaining movie br br While visiting England Edgar Allan Poe sits in a pub telling one of his ghostly stories to Count Blackwood Recognizing the great writer Alan a young news reporter requests an interview with Poe During the course of the conversation Poe reveals that all of his stories are true Incredulous Alan expresses his skepticism about life after death Count Blackwood offers to bet Alan 100 pounds that he cannot survive this night in Blackwood s castle a night following Halloween when the dead walk Alan cannot afford the bet so he bets his life for a 10 pound wager br br Unlike Mario Bava s overpraised Black Sunday aka The Mask of Satan Castle of Blood is fairly restrained making the few moments of violence even more dreadful especially surprising from a director usually associated with those terrible Italian space movies from the 60s br br It s a pity the only version of this film I ve found is badly deteriorated and recorded pan and scan version Even so it is well worth seeing and cries out for a modern remake perhaps with Christina Ricci or Jennifer Love Hewitt in the role of Elizabeth Watch it and enjoy a film that compares well with Robert Wise s The Haunting
I first remember seeing this one back in the 70s when it was shown on late night television Scared the hell out of me But then I was a teenager back in those days not as jaded about films as I am now br br CASTLE OF BLOOD aka DANSE MACABRE is a fine example of the 60s Italian horror genre along with Mario Bava s BLACK SUNDAY 1960 CURSE OF THE LIVING DEAD aka KILL BABY KILL 1966 and Mario Caiano s NIGHTMARE CASTLE 1965 If you want spooky atmosphere along with great writing then check these out as well I also rate these along with those early Poe films that Roger Corman was doing during the same period br br I saw the new Synapse DVD that was taken from a French print and it s a great improvement over that old pan and scan print that was making the rounds on television over the years It adds a couple of minutes of dialog in French that don t really add much to the movie as whole but it s nice to see it complete without cuts Unfortunately the DVD doesn t really offer any extras beyond stills from the film br br One flub I noticed was in the opening scene seeing the smoke effects man next to the camera being reflected on the glass of the inn s front door I guess the editors didn t catch it at the time or maybe they didn t care but it is something I didn t notice the first time That s the wonders of DVD You get to see all the flubs mistakes and details that weren t apparent the first time around But no matter br br But no matter it still gets a 7 on the imdb meter br br
Italy produced a lot of really great and original horror films in the 1960 s and this is certainly one of them The first thing you will notice about Danse Macabre is the style of the film Shot in beautiful black and white and due to director Antonio Margheriti s use of lighting the film almost looks like it could be a German expressionistic horror film This coupled with the horror filled plot line ensures that Danse Macabre is a film that truly captures the essence of horror Of course the fact that the beautiful Barbara Steele appears in the film doesn t harm matters and the good news continues as in this film she gets to flex her acting muscles more than she did in the films that made her famous The plot is very aware of the time in which this was released and so incorporates the great Edgar Allen Poe We follow Alan Foster a writer who accepts a bet from Poe himself and Lord Blackwood that he can t spend an entire night in the latter s creepy old castle Everyone that has spent the night there previously has died and our hero is about to meet the previous wager takers br br Nowadays horror films don t tend to focus so much on each shot and the result is that there isn t much beauty left in the genre It is refreshing therefore to see this film Many of the shots here are incredibly beautiful from the female side of the couple wearing just a see through skirt to my personal favourite a shot of smoke creeping in from under a door This my first Antonio Margheriti film and even after seeing just this one it s obvious that he was one of Italy s premier directors Also interesting is the fact that screenplay was co written by another of the Italian greats Django creator Sergio Corbucci The plot can meander a little too much at times but there s always enough atmosphere on hand to make sure that the film never becomes boring and the fact that it is always intriguing even when the plot slows down ensures the same thing The way that Danse Macabre utilises the haunted house theme is both well done and original and helps to keep the story as eerie as possible On the whole fans of Italian and or cult cinema will not want to miss this little gem
Castle of Blood is a good example of the quality work in the horror genre being turned out in Italy in the 60s The film has all of the right elements old dark house atmosphere a decent story and Barbara Steele Steele makes most any film worth seeing br br The story concerns a haunted castle People have visited but none have returned Our hero makes a wager that he can spend the night in the castle and return to collect his winnings But the night he visits is a special night It s the night each year when the dead return to relive their deaths br br The only flaw I see in the movie is the running time It almost feels padded There is a large portion of the first act where literally nothing happens Our hero stumbles around in the dark finding nothing of interest But once he does find something the movie picks up and become quite enjoyable br br Castle of Blood is a definite must for Steele fans and fans of Italian Gothic horror in general
When American author Edgar Allan Poe visits London he is approached by British journalist Alan Foster who becomes the target of a peculiar wager Not believing Poe s assertion that all of his macabre stories have been based on actual experience Foster accepts a bet from Poe and his friend Sir Thomas Blackwood that he cannot spend an entire night in the Blackwood s haunted castle Once installed in the abandoned castle Foster discovers that he is not alone as he is approached by various beautiful women and handsome men and a doctor of metaphysics who explains that they are all lost souls damned to replay the stories of their demises on the anniversary of their deaths The first time I watched this glorious bit of classic horror I was mesmerized the entire time I found the movie genuinely creepy and at the same time sorrowful Babs Steele is undeniably beautiful The music score makes the atmosphere twice as terror inducing The topless scene threw me for a loop as I was not expecting it It looks as Synapse did a great job with picture enhancement because this movie looks damn fine for its age and it s the Uncut International version to boot This is the movie responsible for me starting a Babs Steele and Klaus Kinski collection
I ve watched this movie a number of times and found it to be very good This movie is also known as Castle Of Terror Coffin Of Terror and Dance Macabre Barbara Steele is her usual beautiful creepy self George Riviere the male lead does a good job with his role The whole movie is dripping with atmosphere and there is a good deal of tension throughout The camera angles are good and the acting for the most part isn t bad This film is quite suitable for a rainy day or evening I have the DVD uncut version which is far superior to the edited TV version Grab some popcorn turn out the lights settle back and enjoy John R Tracy
This complicated story begins fairly simply with an English journalist accepting a wager from Edgar Allen Poe and his friend Lord Blackwood that he cannot spend a night in the haunted Blackwood castle Once there the writer wanders around the dusty rooms and corridors until music and a glimpse of a waltzing couple lead him into an empty room He sits at the harpsichord and starts to play the tune he has heard and is surprised to be tapped on the shoulder by the stunningly beautiful Elizabeth Blackwood She informs him with an ambiguous charming eerie manner that she has prepared his room upstairs and that someone is always expected on this night the Night of the Dead Thus begins a startling series of supernatural events that bewilder the journalist all the rest of the night SPOILER AHEAD it probably won t surprise too many viewers to learn that the lovely Elizabeth is actually a ghost This doesn t prevent her from falling in love with the journalist but it does make things more complicated for them than for the average couple This is a fun movie with absolutely everything ghosts the spooky castle repeated visions of past events sex and violence though both have been toned down in the version most Americans have seen over the years The alluring captivating Barbara Steele is the main reason to see it She has a strange charisma unlike anyone else you ve ever seen in the movies Recommended
I originally saw this movie as a boy at the old Rialto Theatre as part of a Saturday afternoon matin√©e triple bill which also featured Vincent Price s Last Man on Earth and Mario Bava s Nightmare Castle I had nightmares about blood lusting ghosts for a week afterwards Though I didn t know it then all three movies would prove to be classics of the genre No wonder I was so scared Though all three films frightened me it was Castle of Blood that had the most profound impact br br It was the first on the bill I didn t even get to see it from the beginning as we were late getting to the cinema and missed the first 20 minutes of the movie That s lot to miss since the edited print only ran about 79 minutes the unedited runs 87minutes But despite this the dark creepy atmosphere complete with ruined castles fog enshrouded cemeteries shadows and cobwebs Gothic set design strong acting and suspense especially the last 20 minutes scared the bejeepers out of me and made a lasting impression It took me years to finally get a copy of the film for my collection Since it was a French Italian import it wasn t a movie that showed up on the late show in Winnipeg I couldn t quite remember the title remember I didn t get to seen the beginning of the film and was scared witless and to make matters worse the film had been released under literally a dozen different movie titles aka Danze Macabre Coffin of Terror Castle of Terror Long Night of Terror etc and the USA UK working title Castle of Blood was very generic similar to dozens of other b horror and suspense films making it illusive But thanks to the internet and perseverance I found it at last What a treat to finally watch the film in its entirety after so many years It may not have had quite the sheer emotional impact that it did when I was a boy but as haunted house movies go it s stands up well and compares favourably to similar iconic films of the period such as The Haunting The Innocents or Black Sunday The film is a fine early effort of Italian director Antonio Margheriti It stars 60 s scream queen icon Barbara Steele and features a well written screenplay by Sergio Corbucci about a sceptical writer Georges Riviere who on a bet spends the night in haunted house and unsuspectingly becomes part of an annual ongoing ghostly story The hypnotic Steele is well cast as the ghostly love interest as is Arturo Dominici as Dr Carmus and Margarete Robsahm as Julia br br Many of the tricks Margheriti employs to create the film s eerie atmosphere cobwebs creaking doors fog etc are bound to seem clich√© to a modern audience but they work far more effectively in black and white than they ever could in modern day colour Rather than using body counts and special effects the film creates scares the old fashion way relying on a good story stylish direction fine set production interesting camera work and strong acting performances Margheriti does a marvellous job taking these elements and building the film s suspense as the horrifying paranormal secret of the house gradually reveals itself to the unwitting writer br br The film is not without faults The pace drags at the beginning of the film ironically the 20 minutes I originally missed This is probably worsened by Synapse films effort to restore the film to its original length Though fans will likely appreciate the chance to see the film restored in terms of the intro it may have been more of hindrance than a help The English voice dubs are merely passable and in the restored scenes the language shifts from English to French English subtitles provided which is sure to be annoying to some viewers br br However Synapse Films deserves kudos for the quality of the print Clearly some effort was put into its restoration and deservedly so br br I enjoyed the film immensely and highly recommend it to aficionados of 60 s Italian Goth films or anyone who enjoys a good ghost story br br Rob Rheubottom Winnipeg MB Canada
If you re a fan of Gothic horror then you re definitely absolutely guaranteed to LOVE this wondrous Italian 60 s film Castle of Blood We re really talking about creepily creaking doors eerie portraits that appear to be moving spontaneously dying candles although there s no wind and smoke coming from underneath heavy wooden chamber doors Speaking in terms of atmosphere and style this masterful piece of Gothic film making is one of the best out there just one tiny league below landmarks such as Black Sunday The Three Faces of Fear and Curse of the Crying Woman The prominent directors duo Sergio Corbucci The Great Silence Django and Antonio Margheriti Cannibal Apocalypse Killer Fish are successful in all areas including a powerful plot one that is genuinely nightmare inducing ultra sinister scenery and filming locations stylish black and white photography spine chilling music and a brilliant gathering of talented performers Barbara Steele starlet of the aforementioned Black Sunday and Italian goth muse number one shines brightly again as a spiritually tormented character and she s literally surrounded by excellent co players One of them Silvano Tranquilli even gives away a fairly credential depiction of author Edgar Allan Poe The story involves him and another wealthy visitor of a countryside tavern challenging a brutal young journalist to accept a morbid wager If he Alan Foster would survive spending one night in the infamous Blackwood Castle he receives the astonishing reward of 10 and a newspaper interview with Poe Needless to say the ordeal is much more dangerous than it sounds even for somebody like Alan Foster who s a firm non believer in ghosts and vampires The night starts out great for him as he even meets up with the stunningly beautiful woman of his dreams but gradually he learns that Blackwood Castle is a hellish place where the ghosts of the previously deceased visitors are trapped for all eternity I don t know about you but this is seriously one of my favorite horror movie premises of all time Co director Antonio Margheriti clearly was proud of this film as well because he remade it himself a couple of years later as Web of the Spider That movie had a handful of trumps like for example the casting of no less than Klaus Kinski in the role of Edgar Allan Poe but in general this original is vastly superior Castle of Blood literally oozes with atmosphere and maintains a thoroughly unsettling ambiance throughout This truly is one of the rare films that can make the hair on your arms and back of the neck rise with fear if you watch it in the right circumstances Watch it late at night preferably alone and in a candle lit room and you ll get an idea about the true definition of horror
The DVD for Danaza Macabra Castle of Blood is very odd That s because parts of the film are in French with subtitles and the rest is dubbed into English from the French Sometimes characters switched between the two in the middle of a scene When I tried to get the film to be JUST subtitled or just dubbed it made no difference Odd but still watchable br br The story purports to be based on a Poe story though I can t recall which one In fact the character of Poe appears in the beginning and end of the film though it didn t look especially like him br br A rich man makes a bet with a guy down on his luck that he cannot stay the entire night in a manner home It seems like an easy bet to win even if the house is very creepy However it can t be that easy as the rich guy says that all those who previously took the bet died yet this fool STILL wants to make the wager While in the home he meets lovely Barbara Steele within and falls madly for her Later however he learns that she died more than a decade earlier How can this be I could tell you more about the plot but don t want to spoil any of the suspense See it for yourself to find out the rest of the story br br This film gets very high marks for creating a creepy atmosphere The house black white cinematography and music work together to make for a scary looking film As for the plot it s interesting especially because there are many twists and turns so many that you are wondering just who is and who isn t among the undead by the end of the film br br The only negative is that I felt sorry for the poor snake that was needlessly killed Crazy as it might sound I felt sorry for it and it hardly seemed necessary br br Also parents may want to know that towards the end there is a bit of nudity A strikingly beautiful woman appears topless but it s hardly necessary for the plot
I remember seeing this film at the West End theater in Louisville Kentucky when I was a boy The scene where Dr Carmus finds the gardener s coffin and the breathing dead body therein was the scariest part of the movie for me only intensified by the darkness of the film I also wondered about the people hanging from the trees at the end until I recognized the part of the film in which the family name of the Blackwoods was changed from Blackblood due to the fact that in the family history there was a character who was known for his many hangings of various people Sir Thomas Blackwood seemed to get his kicks out of adding to the deaths caused by his family I also noticed that as Foster first enters the gate of the cemetery he is careful in noticing the sharp object of the gate where he meets his end I would not hesitate to recommend this film to horror movie lovers
This begins a wager between Edgar Allen Poe and a journalist Poe bets that the man can not spend an entire night in a creepy castle Well of course he can but will he come out unscathed Hard to say with all these strange people that aren t supposed to be there wandering around including the icy Barbara Steele This is a fairly odd film in that the presentation is both in French and English and switches back and forth a few times Perhaps this is done because bits of dialog were lost It s also rather dark and claustrophobic being that one doesn t see much beyond a small circle of light that candles and such generate plus there s a feel of dread and impending doom pretty much at all times This version on Synapse is also uncensored and I wondered what might be censored in a film from 1964 until I saw the topless scene I guess that might be it Overall this is pretty good and in gloomy black and white Barbara Steele definitely makes the movie too 8 out of 10
I have never seen a Barbara Steele movie that I haven t liked and have always been a sucker for a good haunted house story especially for such wonderful pictures as The Legend of Hell House and the original versions of The Haunting and House on Haunted Hill so I had a feeling that Castle of Blood would be right up my alley And boy was it ever This French Italian coproduction while perhaps not the classic that Steele s first horror film Black Sunday remains to this day is nevertheless an extremely atmospheric chilling entry in the spook genre Filmed in black and white it manages to convey a genuinely creepy miasma The film concerns a journalist who bets one Lord Blackwood and an author named Edgar Allen Poe that he can spend the night in Blackwood s castle on the night of All Saints Day when the spirits of those killed in the castle reenact their fate The viewer gets to see these deaths and they ARE pretty horrible for the most part The film does indeed send shivers up the viewer s spine and in the uncut DVD that I just watched thanks to the fine folks at Synapse even features a surprising topless scene and some mild lesbianism And Barbara is wonderful in this movie her otherworldly beauty is put to good advantage playing a sympathetic spectre Her mere presence turns a creepy ghost story into something truly memorable Not for nothing has she been called The Queen of Horror
Well executed old and very dark house horror Good set up which includes the character of Poe himself alluding to the story in a London pub Although from here it is pretty much the one guy who has taken the dare to visit the house on a particular night running from room to room either looking for or avoiding people it is still most enjoyable Plus we have the delightful and enigmatic Barbara Steele There is some wooden dialogue and some unexplained bits and bobs but it is the super creepy atmosphere that is maintained throughout that and the super musical score that keep this one moving nicely along DVD originates from US and has a few extras
Antonio Margheriti s Danza Macabra aka Castle Of Blood of 1964 is a beautiful and incredibly haunting masterpiece of Italian Gothic Horror and after Mario Bava s La Maschera Del Demonio aka Black Sunday of 1960 and Roger Corman s Pit And The Pendulum of 1961 starring the great Vincent Price another must see that earned the wonderful Barbara Steele her more than deserved fame as the most important female Horror icon in the history of motion pictures But not only is the beautiful and brilliant Barbara Steele one of my favorite actresses of all time the screenplay to Danza Macabra was co written by no one less than the cinematic genius Sergio Corbucci who directed such ingenious Spaghetti Western milestones as Django 1966 and The Great Silence 1968 Italy s number 2 in the field right after Mario Bava Director Antonio Margheriti is one of the all time masters of Gothic Horror and Castle of Blood is doubtlessly his greatest achievement Hardly another film works so brilliantly in creating an incredibly haunting yet beautiful atmosphere as it is the case with this creepy masterpiece br br When he encounters the famous writer of brilliant macabre stories Edgar Allen Poe in a gloomy London tavern young journalist Alan Foster Georges Rivi√®re accepts a bet from a nobleman that he can not spend a night in his haunted castle in the night of all souls eve As soon as Foster enters the eerie castle mysterious things start to happen After a little while however he encounters an enchanting resident of the castle the stunningly beautiful Elisabeth Blackwood Barbara Steele The mysterious events so far however have only been forebodings of the terrors the castle bears however br br The eerie castle setting alone would be sufficient to create a gloomy mood the excellent black and white cinematography and a great score by Riz Ortolani create an incredibly haunting atmosphere that is eerie beyond comparison The wonderful Barbara Steele is fantastic as always I simply can not find enough words to praise this wonderful actress No other actress has ever been capable of uniting ravishing beauty with the uncanny as it is the case with Steele and no actress ever will Besides Steele the movie s cast contains another stunning beauty Margarete Robsahm and she also delivers a great performance George Rivi√®re s performance as Alan Foster is great and the rest of the performances are also very good Castle of Blood is outstanding in many departments Barbara Steele Delivers one of her best performances the cinematography and locations are beautifully haunting beyond comparison the atmosphere is incredibly eerie The film simply is a perfect whole of atmosphere Gothic beauty and the art of terror In short Castle of Blood is one of the most atmospheric and greatest Gothic Horror films ever made and must not be missed by anyone interested in the genre 10 10
Antonio Margheriti s Danza Macabra Castle of Blood is an eerie atmospheric chiller that succeeds on all fronts It looks absolutely beautiful in black white and it has wonderfully creepy Gothic vibe Alan Foster is an English journalist who pursues an interview with visiting American horror writer Edgar Allan Poe Poe bets Foster that he can t spend one night in the abandoned mansion of Poe s friend Thomas Blackwood Accepting the wager Foster is locked in the mansion and the horror begins The film is extremely atmospheric and it scared the hell out of me The crypt sequence is really eerie and the tension is almost unbearable Barbara Steele looks incredibly beautiful as sinister specter Elisabeth Blackwood Castle of Blood is easily one of the best Italian horror movies made in early 60 s A masterpiece
I saw this movie as a kid on Creature Feature when I lived in New York It was a pretty creepy movie though not as good as Horror Hotel I just bought this movie on DVD and it is different from what I remember because in the DVD that I bought there are several scenes where the actors speak in French and or Italian and no subtitles are provided Then the other actors respond in English to what was being said Kind of weird Also on the DVD box the names of some of the actors are spelled differently than on IMDb br br Aside from that this movie is different in that the character of Elsie takes her clothes off and provides a nude shot in one scene and in another scene Julia tries to force Elizabeth Barbara Steele to make out with her by pushing her down on the bed and kissing her while Steele resists That scene existed in the TV version but it was very edited I wonder if there is any extra footage that could be incorporated into a remastered ultra edition It seems sad that some of these old low budget classics have been spliced to bits and sold in all kinds of edited versions Where are the master tapes and all the unused footage br br Aside from the first boring twenty minutes before Allen is delivered to the Castle the rest of the movie is pretty good There aren t too many special effects but Herbert s face after Julia clubs him is a good one The creepy atmosphere and the strange exotic and seductive look of Barbara Steele make the movie a lot better than it should be I can honestly say that if Barbara Steele had not been in this film it would be a big zero She makes the movie a ten
Yakitate Ja pan translated as Fresh Baked Japanese Bread is the story of a young man named Azuma Kazuma and his journey to make the perfect Japanese Bread or Ja pan for Japan and for the Japanese that will be recognized the the whole world br br Of course that s just on the outside In reality Yakitate Ja pan isn t really about the bread but the reaction that come after eating the bread and the pun that comes with the reaction The series is lovable because of these puns From popular anime titles like Naruto Detective Conan and Dragon Ball to blockbuster movies like The Matrix and Lord of the Rings It s all there br br So what makes this title different from other titles of the same genre like Cooking Master Boy or Mr Ajikko Well unlike the others who use cooking for world domination Yakitate Ja pan is purely comedy Sure there are times that the story turns to drama or even murder but the comedic atmosphere makes you laugh at them You ll be laughing at their own view of heaven Just watch it br br Just remember that this is also fiction although some of the bread made here are based on real bread eating the home made Japan 2 won t turn you to a Super Saiyan or turn your body to rubber
Yaitate Japan is a really fun show and I really like it It was shown in our country just recently in Hero TV and ABS CBN every 5 30 It is about Azuma Kazuma who is trying to fulfill his dream to make Japanese bread that will represent his country He is working in the Southern Toyo branch of Pantasia and he is also helping his friend Tsukino Azusagawa along with other bakers like Kawachi Kyousuke and Kanmuri Shigeru to beat St Pierre and take control of Pantasia They fight other skillful bakers from many other countries and not only learn to make different kinds of bread but also learn to cook other food It is a really funny and unique anime because they also mimic characters from other anime like Naruto Detective Conan and One Piece and famous people from real life It is one of the best works of Takashi Haschiguchi and is really a must see for people of different ages
For those of you who think anime is just about giant reptiles raping schoolgirls think again There is a totally different side to the Japanese animation Yakitate Japan is one of those shows It is a sweet natured tale of a young boy with the gift to make delicious bread His universe is all about creating a Japanese bread that can match with the famous European breads The show is as wacky as they come and I m sure that non Japanese viewers will miss a lot of the jokes But it is still very nice to watch because of the complete innocent vibe of the show br br In the world of Yakitate it is not uncommon for people to look like they ve just had an orgasm after eating bread The bread is hallucinating and can give the consumer a wide array of super powers from time traveling to swimming like a fish That weird aspect makes it into one of the least predictable and funny shows I ve watched in a while
When I first started watching this anime I never thought that something about making bread could actually be interesting but thankfully I was mistaken From the moment I started watching it anime just pulled into the world of bread making I was hooked br br The biggest advantage of this anime is it s humor which is very intelligent and very funny with some recurring gags But the animation soundtrack and character development are below average while these disadvantages aren t seen so much in the first episodes because of the great job on this anime it really starts to show in the last 20 episodes when the reactions and recurring gags just grow old and aren t as funny as before br br As far as I m concerned if this anime had ended with episode 52 I would have given it a 9 but the last episodes just leave a bitter aftertaste which sadly can t be washed away by the awesome 50 episodes br br 7 10
The premise of this anime series is about bread of all things to base a plot on I truly laughed The main character has a special bread making power that he was born with and he goes off to bread baking school I wish it were available on DVD and it doesn t matter if it s subtitled or dubbed it s that good Even the theme song alone is funny At one point in the theme song there s an African Japanese man with an afro on horseback wielding a French baguette as if it were a samurai sword These images will not make sense unless you see the anime You ll laugh until your sides hurt It is definitely the most unique anime I have seen thus far
I usually steer clear of TV movies because of the many ways you know that it s TV movies five seconds into the picture This one got my attention because of the unusual title and its gloomy well crafted mood that is established from the very start While the ever present rain confirmed my suspicions of a misplaced story even if claiming to be set in California the movie was largely shot around a stormy Vancouver B C the dark and oppressive outdoors beautifully complement Olmos excellent acting
This movie is obviously low budget filmed in British Columbia Canada The obstacles that had to be overcome to make this movie convincing set in California late 60 s 80 s were well conceived I believe this is the best most accurate version of the Zodiac killings that plagued the town of Vallejo the Bay area from 1968 19 he was never caught Edward James Olmos Det Dave Toschi George Dzundza Zodiac at the time believed to be Arthur Leigh Allen since cleared by DNA fingerprints play a game of cat mouse re visiting crime scenes together each one trying to trigger the other into an emotional revelation Olmos dying from some type of terminal disease knowing Dzundza did it still totally obsessed to the point of losing his family becoming a full blown alcoholic along the way Dzundza totally oblivious self absorbed like all serial killers to the carnage left in his wake The only disappointment was the over the top ending otherwise pretty accurate If you tire of the typical Hollywood fluff or have an interest in the Zodiac case check it out
Another comment about this film made it sound lousy Given talking pictures were so new I think the script and acting were good Davis was so young and fresh She had not yet found her own style that we had grown to expect Yet it is great to see her this way still learning the craft br br So many clich√©s came from this film and it seems this film blazed some trails for the next 70 years My vote is see it and remember how young this type of film was Keep and open mind and you maybe shocked at how troubled the characters were in this picture for being 1934 and how we view the early part of last century as uptight I love it and hope you make up your own mind about it not influenced by others negative and one note comments
that the Bette Davis version of this film was better than the Kim Novak version br br Despite all of the other comments written here I really prefer the Bette Davis version even though the Novak version has a more coherent story line br br However Davis Mildred s raw emotions seem to me to be more apt to a sluttish girl who seems easily to become a prostitute br br And it is those raw emotions that constitute part of what the poor doctor falls in love with He has emotions of despair of failure of otherness strong emotions that he represses Davis Mildred on the other hand displays her emotions immediately and without censure She has no feelings of despair or of failure or of otherness rather she is merely surviving as a poor Cockney woman in the Victorian era br br Novak s portrayal was a more vulnerable Mildred than was Davis almost through the the whole movie Davis Mildred was never vulnerable until she actually had to go to the doctor and beg for assistance And when he reviles her for her method of keeping body and soul together and for continually taking advantage of his love for her she unleashes arguably the most passionate repudiation of snobbish holier than thou attitude ever seen on screen I wiped my mouth I WIPED MY MOUTH Novak s vulnerability was excellent Davis realism was monumental br br IMDb votes concur
Although this film put Davis on the map due to her brilliantly intense performance as the illiterate guttersnipe waitress prostitute Mildred Rogers this film is strangely unsatisfying to me as a whole The acting is indeed fine in most every respect What I cannot fathom for the life of me is just how or why Phillip a sensitive well bred young man would take the constant abuse this tramp constantly dishes out towards him I find his naive tolerance quite ridiculously unbelievable in certain respects Yes I know he is a sensitive club footed introverted intellectual But Davis is such a venomous witch that nobody that cultured would tolerate her attitude or actions and make it believable Davis is astounding in her role yes she may go overboard in her histrionics now and then but it s a vividly creative portrayal any which way you look at it Too bad she wasn t playing a gangster s moll Her character would have been completely believable as a tramp among low lifes
When I saw that this film was only 80 minutes long I thought we were in trouble Condensing the gigantic W Somerset Maugham novel down to a movie that clocks in at under an hour and a half seemed like a disaster waiting to happen But you know the movie s not half bad and it even manages to retain much of what makes the book resonate so much with its readers br br I ve heard many film buffs complain that Leslie Howard was a wet noodle of an actor and he was but I can t think of anyone more suited to play the role of Philip Carey than a wet noodle for that s certainly what Carey is Howard plays him well which means you want to shake him and slap him upside the head repeatedly then finally take him out and buy him a spine br br Ah and then there s Bette as the girl with whom Carey is obsessed and who brings his world crashing down around him I didn t know what on earth the appeal of Mildred was in the book and the movie stays true to that detail But as played by Davis she does become the most fascinating character in the story and if she s nasty and unlikable she s at least the most dynamic person on screen at any given time Davis s performance here is credited with changing the course of screen acting much as Brando s would do nearly 20 years later when he screamed out Stella in that little known Tennesee Williams play and it s not hard to see why Davis is intense to the point of scary She makes no effort to wring any sympathy from the audience and she allows herself to look ugly and most unglamorous Her appearance when Carey walks in on her late in the film to find her dead or nearly dead of an unnamed disease though not much care is taken to hide the fact that it s an STD is shocking Of course it helps that this movie squeaked out just before the Production Code went into effect if it had been made a year later you can bet things would have been a bit different br br Yes much of the novel and many of its most interesting parts are left on the cutting room floor and the story really does become about Carey and Mildred and not much else I found that to be the least interesting and most tedious part of Maugham s novel but it is the part that gives the novel its title and seems to be the part that readers are still drawn to now so it strikes me as a wise decision on the part of the film makers that they chose to adapt the novel the way they did br br Grade B
Today actresses happily gain weight dye their hair dress like slobs and lose their glamor for a role and Bette Davis was probably the actress who started the trend Even as a pretty young woman who occasionally wore designer clothes and Constance Bennett type makeup in films Davis was willing to ravage herself in order to create a character on the outside as well as the inside br br Her determination is amply demonstrated here in her breakout film Of Human Bondage in which she stars with Leslie Howard as Philip Carey Davis plays Mildred a slutty manipulative greedy low life to Howard s masochistic club footed Philip He first meets her when she s a waitress and she allows him to take her out to dinner and theater while she frolics with a wealthy older man Alan Hale Sr In truth Mildred is repulsed by Philip s club foot On his part Philip seems to enjoy the abuse of her open flirtation and her coolness toward him He allows Mildred to bleed him dry financially in between boyfriends who drop her when they tire of her while he blows off a couple of truly lovely women Kay Johnson and Frances Dee When he gets the gumption to throw her out Mildred trashes his apartment and robs him forcing him to withdraw from medical school and lose his lodgings br br Of Human Bondage looks rather stilted today in parts Though Leslie Howard was a wonderful actor and attractive his acting style is of a more formal old school and as a result he tends to date whatever he s in He shines in material like his role opposite Davis in It s Love I m After or The Petrified Forest which call for his kind of technique His dated acting is even more obvious here because Davis was forging new ground with a gritty edgy performance that would really make her name If she seems at times over the top she came from the stage and the subtleties of film acting would emerge later for her Contrast this performance with the restraint warmth and gentleness of her Henriette in All This and Heaven Too or the pathos she brought to Dark Victory She was a true actress and a true artist Davis really allows herself to look like holy hell Mildred s deterioration is absolutely pathetic as Philip seems to gain strength as her spirit fades br br An excellent film in which to see the burgeoning of one of film s greatest stars
Reading web sites on Bette Davis one can find instances where authors claim that there is nothing special about her acting I even found a site which claimed that Bette Davis success was probably due to her luck But Ms Davis films of 1934 tell quite the opposite The most evident example are two films that she did only few weeks apart Fog over Frisco and On Human Bondage Characters she played in these movies though both being negative are quite different Arlene in the former is a beautiful glamorous and frivolous heiress and much more likable character than Mildred in the latter which is a pale uneducated and impudent Cockney waitress Needless to say that Ms Davis played both characters very authentic and with the same enthusiasm But even that is not all The point is that the former role which would be wished by most actresses of the day was the one she was forced to play The latter role which seemed to most actresses as undesirable career destroying role was the one she fought for ferociously for months And it was the latter role that launched her among the greatest stars So there is no question that Ms Davis knew from the start what she was doing br br The film which tells about a medical student Phillip Carey Leslie Howard which falls unhappily in love with Cockney waitress Mildred Rogers Bette Davis has a few week points but many more strong ones The story is simply too big to be told in mere 83 minutes For example it is quite unclear why refined student found any interest in an impudent waitress in the first place Well there is one scene in which we are exposed to Ms Davis captivating eyes but this is when his emotions are already fully evolved Nevertheless the integrity of the story is preserved by superior acting from Howard and Davis as well as fantastic Steiner s music which tells tons of emotions even when we do not see characters faces In fact the film is amalgamated by Phillip s walking sequences showing him from the back supplemented with shuddering two tone repetition Every detail is well thought Max Steiner wrote a beautiful leitmotif for each women in Phillip s life which is consistently used through the film And a beautiful scene in which we see Sally s face in front of calendar is one of the sweetest scenes I ve ever seen exactly due to Francis Dee s breathtaking beauty Ms Dee was by the way considered to be too beautiful to play leading role in Gone with a Wind as well as Steiner s captivating music Camera movements between the some scenes is also original and refreshing br br But my strongest objection is that events are presented too two dimensionally which induce viewer that Mildred is an ultimate slut The most disgusting characters ought to be men which lure her into relationship despite well knowing that they will abandon her after taking use of her but they curiously finished portrayed as likable characters After all Mildred always in her own specific but still a honest way lets Phillip know that she despises him and had no interest in him Which he just refuses to hear It is Phillips masochistic nature connected to his club foot and infantile experiences that is the principal reason of his love problem He is enslaved to his club foot as much as to Mildred and perhaps has to be free of both to start a normal life Of course selfish and impudent Mildred after discovering voluntary Phillip s bondage to her did its own share to make his life hell Even taking into account that she exploded after realizing that the bondage has loosen it is less than clear why would she burn Phillip s money Maugham intended different in his novel After all she could as well steal it and drunk gallons of champagne br br For modern standards the film is a bit outdated but each subsequent time you watch it you can reveal new interesting details due to superior acting fascinating music and original editing so it does deserve the highest possible mark
Somerset Maugham s characters are brought to life in RKO s Of Human Bondage but the movie is a too skeletal version of the novel with Bette Davis star making performance sucking up all of the energy Otherwise it s the story of Leslie Howard as Philip Carey he dreams of becoming a painter but is told he has no talent for the arts As the film progresses Mr Howard s struggles instead to become a doctor His efforts seem to indicate some bad advice regarding the arts though successful in medicine his painting seemed easier also note the symbolism of his disability a club foot explained in the film br br Along the way right away in this version Howard becomes infatuated with waitress Davis as Mildred Rogers Davis characterization of Mildred is extraordinary culminating in a spectacular speech when she tells Howard among other things that she had to WIPE MY MOUTH after kissing him Howard also performs well but the story fails to explain his prolonged fascination and love for Davis so their performances are wasted br br Still a film to watch for the acting including some good supporting players Bette Davis characterization was famous for inspiring a write in campaign for the 1934 Best Actress Academy Award For the record she placed third The results were br br 1 Claudette Colbert It Happened One Night br br 2 Norma Shearer The Barretts of Wimpole Street br br 3 Bette Davis Of Human Bondage br br 4 Grace Moore One Night of Love br br Of Human Bondage 6 28 34 John Cromwell Leslie Howard Bette Davis Reginald Denny
The movie may be great I just watched it last night but feel unable to give an honest opinion of it because I read the book first The book is so much better than the movie that I was disappointed with the film If you plan to watch Of Human Bondage don t read the book beforehand On the other hand the book is so good and contains so much more than the love affair Phillip has with Mildred you could still enjoy it after seeing the movie I do not make this claim lightly I average reading a book every 4 days and read such disparate authors as Danielle Steel Ovid Faulkner Plato and Shakespeare Of Human Bondage gets my vote as one of the top ten novels ever written
Bette Davis electrifying performance is such that it is hard to remember the other female players They were as perfect in their parts as Davis was in hers they just didn t have as much to do Some of the reviewers felt that the book was so much better it was but to give the film it s due to condense a 600 page book down to 83 minutes is no mean feat The first part of the book didn t even make it to the screen it told of Phillip s childhood then moved to Germany and Paris where Phillip had gone to try to make good as an artist It also chronicles his first romance with Fanny Price who kills herself when she realises Phillip cannot return her feelings of love It is a wonderful book but rambling and I think that anyone who does not think too highly of the film should read the book and will realise how good the film is br br After realising that he will only ever be a mediocre painter Phillip Carey Leslie Howard comes back to England hoping to take up medicine When out at a tearoom he meets a sullen waitress Mildred Bette Davis Even though she has no interest in him and basically treats him like dirt Phillip is obsessed It is so hard to watch his efforts at trying to find any civility in this vicious shrew In one scene she promises to meet him in a second class railway waiting room when they almost miss each other she berates him with why would I wait in a second class waiting room when there is a first class one available You just want to shake him The only time she is pleasant to him is when she tells him she is going to marry another man a coarse sales man Emile Miller Alan Hale With Mildred out of the picture he meets Nora Kay Johnson a lovely woman who writes romantic novels under a male pseudonym She jokes about the popularity the books enjoy among servants in the novel he had seen Mildred reading them Nora gives Phillip all the love and confidence he needs but he is incapable of returning her love When Mildred returns Miller didn t marry her and she is having a baby of course he takes care of her and helps her with the baby in the film it is treated as an object always called baby never given a name or gender she repays him by running off with his best friend br br At the hospital he meets Sally Athelny Frances Dee who is visiting her sick father He begins to visit her home and for the first time in his life gets a sense of family Then surprise surprise Mildred returns like a bad penny and surprise Philip takes her in But he has changed and feels only disgust when she tries to show gratitude the only way she knows how Then follows one of the most vicious verbal fights on film with phrases such as you cad you dirty swine I only kissed you because you begged me and when you went I wiped my mouth I WIPED MY MOUTH In the book a lot of Mildred s stock phrases such as you re a gentleman in every sense of the word I don t mind and Mr High and Mighty were associated with prostitutes and when Phillip meets her for the first time he is struck by that br br The end of the film shows Phillip being truly free of Mildred in the only way possible now free to love Sally Again in the book Sally tells Phillip that she thinks she is having a baby but that just makes him more sure of his love That ending like Mildred s sickness could not be in the film even a pre code one br br Kay Johnson was always called on to play sensible believable women which she played to perfection as she was obviously sensible herself Her Nora was the woman Philip should have stayed with Frances Dee was one of the most beautiful of screen ingenues She was obviously being groomed for stardom with some roles that proved she was not just a pretty face The Silver Cord and Blood Money but when she married Joel McCrea her career started to peter out Her Sally did not push her talent to the limits Apparently Leslie Howard was not very helpful to Bette Davis on the set he was annoyed that an English actress was not given the part He used to throw her her lines whilst reading a book off camera He did start to take an interest when a newspaper reported the kid was running away with the picture br br Highly Highly Recommended
This 1934 adaptation of Somerset Maugham s novel put Bette Davis on the map as a movie actress She might have won an Academy Award for her performance but the films was made on loan so her studio didn t push for her Her acting in this one doesn t come off well by today s standards As the heartless waitress who jerks Philip a sensitive medical student around and nearly ruins his life Davis is way too shrill almost demonic Director John Cromwell who usually elicited good performances from his actresses was perhaps overwhelmed by this one Davis is watchable for sure but so strident and predatory as to seem scarcely human I imagine the character of Millie as quieter less feminine than Davis with maybe a touch of the tomboy Davis is such a strong immediate presence that s there s no air of mystery to her which makes Philip s attraction to her seem more overtly masochistic than it should be br br As Philip Leslie Howard is excellent His wan somewhat wilted good looks are perfect for this failed aesthete Nor does he impose a personal interpretation on the part as say Dirk Bogarde might have done which gives his work a rare clarity He seems completely in control here as he should be playing a man with a rational intellect who is in the grip of irrational emotions he cannot manage or even fully satisfy as the object of his affections moves him in ways he cannot understand Howard was a fine actor too often cast in standard romantic parts which compelled him to fall back on charm which he doesn t use here br br It s been so long since I ve read the book I don t feel comfortable commenting on the movie s faithfulness to it I think it captures the spirit of the story well enough and that it has in Howard a perfect Philip Carey The sexual undercurrents are muted and at times Philip behaves so masochistically that in the absence of strong sex feelings makes one wonder about the character s sanity surely not Mr Maugham s intention Thanks to Howard s performance Philip remains firmly in focus as one can see in his various responses to and yearnings for Millie the extremes to which a reasonable intellect will go to understand the irrational in himself and in others br br Overall a very good film a little stilted at times due to its age it evokes London nicely and is well acted for the most part
I saw this film again and noticed how close it is to the novel if we ignore the part about Cary s Leslie Howard childhood Considering that br br at the time not much can be shown on the screen not that there is much in the novel the obsession of the character with Mildred Bette Davis is very well conveyed to the audience I recommend this film to anyone who ever fell for another person and the other side tried to take advantage of him or her I have read that Maugham was asked to make a recording of the novel for sale but when he started to in the studio he began crying and could not finish more than a few lines and whole project was chucked One can tell the novel is written from the heart and the film is a good br br adaptation of a part of it at least
Bette Davis turns in a coldly amusing performance as Mildred Rogers in this 1934 film The film seems rather dated now in 2003 It is no doubt well worth watching for film buffs and Bette Davis fans but may not have as much appeal for the average movie watcher today It was startling for me to see how young Ms Davis looks in this move The actors turn in performances which are basically sound and the story is meaningful and interesting Leslie Howard is well cast as Philip Carey the club footed medical student This is a film with a strong message about whom we choose to love and why However Of Human Bondage didn t seem to have a strong impact on me mentally or emotionally I felt slightly indifferent and detached about the movie after viewing it I have an intuition that this may be the reaction that the director was going for You be the judge br br
The story is somewhat stilted what with the main character s sudden reversals of fortune but Leslie Howard and Bette Davis s portrayals of Philip Carey the na√Øve obsessed lover and Mildred Rogers the unworthy object of his affections raise this film considerably above standard melodrama br br Sensitive cultured Philip who for most of the picture is in bondage to first his infatuation and then his pity for Mildred is not unlike a character Howard was to play a few years later Ashley Wilkes the Southern gentleman too refined and decent to make it in the rough Reconstruction era Philip in fact seems resigned to disappointment even before Mildred enters the picture he doesn t even seem particularly surprised when his art teacher tells him he ll never make it as a painter It is perhaps this passivity these lowered expectations that makes him put up with the selfish Cockney waitress for as long as he does br br Although Leslie Howard is memorable today Of Human Bondage is mainly thought of as a Bette Davis picture perhaps because of the well known story of how she had to fight Jack Warner to get the part of Mildred and perhaps too because movie audiences tend to prefer characters with her sort of brash energy Mildred may have a grating voice but she also has the ethereal beauty of a stained glass angel making it somewhat understandable why Philip let himself be strung along for as long as he did Although man eating Mildred may at times seem one dimensional she does evoke sympathy in the viewer from time to time as when she becomes ill and belatedly realizes that Philip is the only decent man who ever cared for her One may also think she is on to something when she accuses Philip of looking down on her for not being fine enough The scene in which Philip and Norah dismiss romance magazines as trash for kitchen maids seems to confirm this br br Most of the supporting characters are also effective particularly Norah the sensible romance writer who loves Philip but knows she can never compete with Mildred and Sally who has Mildred s beauty and Norah s decency and emerges as the deserving woman Philip is rewarded with in the end The only character I found hollow was Sally s eccentric ale slurping aristocratic father who seems like a stock character from an earlier era br br A classic that deserves it reputation
I just saw Of Human Bondage for the first time a few days ago and WOW What a mysterious and almost spooky film I loved how the music went with the pace of each step of Philip s feet It gave me the chills for some reason br br One of the greatest aspects of this film is that you get to see Bette Davis coming into herself right before your eyes She s great not necessarily because this is her best work but because it was so out of the ordinary to be so vicious gritty and unflinching as an actress in 1934 Bette was a risk taker always wanting to be different and this is right about when she started to realize that she could be as nasty and daring as she wanted and people would love her for it If you re a true lover of film it s amazing to see br br She just had a way of delivering a line that made the part and the film for that matter belong to her Like A mass of music and fire That s me an old kazoo and some sparklers or But you are Blanche you are in that chair or WITH ALL MY HEART I STILL LOVE THE MAN I KILLED Those are from a few of her films but you get my drift She was just so brave sassy and exotic looking with those beautiful big eyes After seeing this I can t believe it was remade twice br br Leslie Howard was gorgeous so calm and persistent needing to be loved I thought he was adorable and couldn t understand how everyone wasn t falling for him but then again everyone was except Mildred He did a great job br br The only thing that I didn t like was something that was common with the writing in the early films They d make a character so hateful that it s almost unbelievable that someone would actually fall for them in the first place The performances were great but in real life Philip would have never been interested in Mildred That s just the simple truth See it
This is a well directed film from John Cromwell who was not a great director but who did make some fine films including the 1937 version of The Prsoner of Zenda Set in a London that only Hollywood could manage atmospheric but nothing like the real thing it is a story of obsession and thwarted love from the novel by Somerset Maughan br br I was looking forward to seeing it on DVD as I had never seen it before and being a great admirer of Bette Davis wanted to see her in a role considered one of her early great ones So I bought it Well she looked fine but I m sorry to say her London cockney accent just made me laugh Bette Davis was one of the greatest film actors make no mistake but here she did make one It was impossible to take her character seriously It wasn t as gruesome as the Dick Van Dyke Mary Poppins cockney accent but close br br In the other major role was Leslie Howard and he did it superbly He was a subtle and intelligent actor The supporting actors acquit themselves well Worth watching despite Ms Davis vocal gymnastics
Bette Davis cockney accent in this film is absolutely appalling I totally understand that Americans and other nationalities mightn t realise this and that s fine but believe me it s about half as good as Dick Van Dyke s cockney accent in Mary Poppins and that was a right load of old pony slipped into London vernacular there many apologies br br The remarkable thing to me is that the strange accents and exaggerated acting styles don t detract from the films power Of Human Bondage is a fascinating piece of cinema despite its superficial faults It also has to be viewed in perspective The technical and cultural limitations of film making at the time have to be appreciated and given those limitations John Cromwell does a very good job directing the camera and allowing the narrative to develop cinematically rather than solely via the mannered acting and stilted dialogue A fine example of his skillful direction is the scene set at Victoria Station It is beautifully conceived shot and edited Note too the stark shots of the prostrate Mildred towards the end of the film they owe more to the early days of artistic film making than the sanitised formulaic world of the studio that was about to dominate br br The themes of the film are universally familiar and compelling ones sexual obsession unrequited love scorned passion self loathing manipulative relationships social divides and youthful folly Though the dialogue is often rather hackneyed the difficult task of portraying these themes and the inner lives of the characters is tackled well albeit in a low key way Some of the scenes of obsession and emotional rejection are uncomfortable to watch but the story doesn t descend into clich√© we re aware that the characters even the poisonous Mildred are both victims and perpetrators and that their actions are motivated by their misunderstanding of each others feelings as well as by wilful selfishness Whilst naive in style the story reaches to the complex heart of the human condition and the mannered nature of the acting and the occasionally grating exchanges don t diminish the veracity of the work br br Of Human Bondage was one of the films that got Bette Davis noticed in Hollywood and whilst watching it you are conscious of being witness at the birth of a celebrated career Her unconventional beauty and screen charisma no one flounced or did disdain quite like Ms Davis grab your attention from her first appearance Whilst hers is definitely the memorable performance in the film Leslie Howard is also excellent as the sensitive and fragile student Philip Carey They are a good combination though why oh why didn t he help her with that terrible terrible accent
The movie concerns about Philip Leslie Howard he s a serious but handicapped medicine student He falls fatally in love with a heartless predatory waitress called Mildred Bette Davis She leaves him engaging with others Alan Hale Reginald Denny Meanwhile he is romanced with another suitors Kay Johnson Frances Dee but she goes back in a mutually destructive affair br br Easily the best and first of numerous films versions of Somerset Maugham s novel Bette Davis as the cockney cruel waitress winning yet another magnificent interpretation with an alluring and smouldering performance absolutely hypnotic in her account of the bondage that occurs from the beginning to the finale Davis rose the stardom with her performance Her role as tough and crude domineering woman will be repeated several times in posteriors acting Leslie Howard as the essentially good and decent student subtly destroyed gives an excellent and melancholic performance He was an awesome actor Gone with the wind besides producer and writer and dead in plane crash during WWII Both will play again in Petrified forest 1936 The atmosphere film is elaborately recreated in the RKO Radio Picture Inc studio is entirely convincing Remade in 1946 by Edmund Goulding with Eleanor Parker and Paul Henreid and in 1964 by Ken Hughes with Kim Novak and Laurence Harvey The motion picture will like to classic cinema buffs Rating Very good but a little bit dated
Enjoyable in spite of Leslie Howard s performance Mr Howard plays Philip as a flat uninteresting character One is supposed to feel sorry for this man however I find myself cheering Bette Davis Mildred Ms Davis gives one her finest performances she received an Academy Award nomination Thanks to her performance she brings this rather dull movie to life Be sure not to miss when Mildred tells Philip exactly how she feels about him
This movie is about sexual obsession Bette Davis plays Mildred This is a woman who men are drawn to Not because she is a nice beautiful girl but because she is a sexual entity Now the movie does not come out and say that but it is obvious There is a scene in the movie in which men are all going googly eyes over her She works as a waitress in a coffee shop she can t read and she not really anybody to look at but she is a flirt It is obvious the male customers in that coffee shop are there because of her One day Phillip a club footed failed painter medical student comes in the shop to say a good word for his friend but he becomes besotted the moment he sees her He starts buying her things even pays for her apartment Meanwhile she is seeing other people and she makes no secrets of it He dreams about her like she is a angel but she is no angel He is constantly thinking about her His med school grades are even failing So what the nookie is too good He wants to marry her but she rejects him because she is marrying another guy She always lets Phil know she really doesn t have love feelings for him all of time He is heart broken but he meets another woman They seem fine but it is obvious he is still dreaming of the Bimbo Mildred does comes back with a baby and unwed Phillip takes her in again but she starts going out with a friend of his the light bulb comes on a little and he kicks her out She does what she knows works so she tries to seduce him well it doesn t work and she proceeds to burn his tuition money up Oh we have a club foot that he has problems about even though a street teenager who has the same problem tells him to lighten up about it He meets another girl named Sally we have a March of time montage which shows her aging while he strings her along still waiting for Mildred Well he has no school tuition can t find a job Finally Sally and her dad takes him in Not before another March of Time montage showing him going downhill Soon his uncle who raised him dies and he gets money to become a doctor Meanwhile he finds Mildred needs him again She has TB meanwhile he is still leading Sally down the Primrose path about marriage and he takes a job on a steamship Finally the bimbo dies and Phillip declares he is free now and he will marry Sally I wished she told him to stuff it Now I know my take on the characters are not going to get me any points But I feel Phillip was the bad guy Yes Mildred is a Strumpet BUT he knows it and he keeps coming back Mean while he has two other girlfriends who love him but he treats as appetizers I guess the sex wasn t as good But in any case he dogs those women waiting for Mildred Not only that but the man who gets Mildred pregnant is already married and when Philip asks him what he intends to do about Baby apparently the baby s name he laughs is off he has no intention in supporting her and Baby and he is wealthy Sally s father who has 9 children say some pretty nasty things about women but he is said to be a old traditionalist Philip doesn t seem to refute his feelings either Men are using Mildred as a Boy Toy but the men in this movie come out as unscathed Yes she was not a respectable woman but far from a villain To me it is Philip who was had the real problem and it was his sexual obsession for Mildred
I happen to like Leslie Howard in his better films Yet for some reason his performance in OF HUMAN BONDAGE never has moved me tremendously I first saw the film on my college campus in 1972 and the reviewer in the college newspaper made the comment that in the 1930s and 1940s Howard played the roles supposedly later picked up by Dirk Bogard as the man who was born to be betrayed This is not usually the case off hand I think of Ashley Wilkes as a man who might be betrayed if he and Scarlett O Hara were meant to be an item by Margaret Mitchell but Ashley loved Melonie not Scarlett Howard could play any type and a role like R J Mitchell or Professor Henry Higgins is not one who is betrayed br br One can make the case that Philip Armstrong Scott is betrayed by the two strangers he shows hospitality to in 49TH PARALLEL but they are Nazis who consider him a liberal westerner Canadian fair game to double cross in wartime It isn t the same as emotional betrayal and Howard does not shrivel up as a result but faces the Nazis and captures one after beating him up br br I think what the reviewer meant was that Howard could be soulful or try to be soulful Witness his poet dreamer wanderer in THE PETRIFIED FORREST But that character was not betrayed except by history perhaps as he feels his type is as out of date as the gangster played by Humphrey Bogart The character of Philip Carey in Somerset Maugham s OF HUMAN BONDAGE is soulful too He is sensitive for several reasons He has an interest in art and tries to become a painter but unlike the artist Strickland in THE MOON AND SIXPENCE he has no real talent So he decides to concentrate on medical studies accentuated by a club foot condition he has Here he is a man with low self esteem who is set up to be betrayed br br Philip finds that betrayal in the form of Mildred a Cockney waitress Bette Davis who is mercenary and as selfish as they come Why Philip falls for her is not really addressed in the film but he does find the woman fascinating And she finds him an easy meal ticket Ironically in being so captivated by this slut Philip fails to notice two other women who are interested in him Kay Johnson and Frances Dee and are more fit to be his mate He also keeps finding himself forgiving Davis when she has affairs with other men Alan Hale and Reginald Denny the latter a friend of Howard s br br Although Howard s performance captures the doormat tendency of Philip towards Mildred he really does not show enough passion until late in the movie when he turns on her That is why I find I never cared for his performance here it lacks any reality His later tortured insistence in GONE WITH THE WIND that he loves Olivia De Haviland not Vivian Leigh has more consistency with a man in love But the performance of Davis as Mildred makes the film important She had a wide variety of parts up to 1934 like the girlfriend of the deaf pianist in THE MAN WHO PLAYED GOD or the spoiled heiress who gets murdered in FOG OVER FRISCO or the mouse like secretary in THREE ON A MATCH As Mildred she finally showed she could be a major actress by playing a selfish bitch br br Curiously her performance was not all of one note While she uses and abuses Howard for two thirds of the film culminating in that famous scene where she shows how disgusted his kissing of her made her her last scenes show she too could fall apart due to her health deteriorating and her inability to keep any honest jobs When Howard rejects her the viewers fail to note how equally vicious he becomes he asks what happened to her baby she tells him the baby died and Howard says brusquely that he is glad which is hardly the response she expects In the end Howard does finally get his life in order but Mildred ends a casualty ironically her death discovered by her old boyfriend Denny on a medical call The Motion Picture Academy of Arts and Sciences did fail to nominate Davis in 1934 leading to the largest write in campaign in it s history and a permanent change in it s rules but Davis was established as a star In one year she won the Oscar as Joyce Heth in DANGEROUS And in two years she co starred with Howard again as equal stars in THE PETRIFIED FORREST
Every motion picture Bette Davis stars in is worth experiencing Before Davis co stars with Leslie Howard in Of Human Bondage she d been in over a score of movies Legend has it that Davis was robbed of a 1935 Oscar for her performance as a cockney speaking waitress unwed mother manipulative boyfriend user Mildred Rogers The story goes that the AFI consoled Davis by awarding her 1st Oscar for playing Joyce Heath in Dangerous I imagine Davis fans of Of Human Bondage who agree with the Oscar robbing legend are going to have at my critique s contrast of the 1934 film for which the AFI didn t award her performance the 1936 film Dangerous performance for which she received her 1st Oscar in 1937 br br I ve tried to view all of Bette Davis motion pictures TV interviews videos advertisements for WWII TV performances in popular series In hindsight it is easy to recognize why this film Of Human Bondage gave Davis the opportunity to be nominated for her performance She was only 25yo when the film was completed just about to reach Hollywood s red carpet The public began to notice Bette Davis as a star because of her performance in Of Human Bondage That is what makes it her legendary performance But RKO saw her greatness in The Man Who Played God borrowed her from Warners to play Rogers br br I m going to go with the AFI in hindsight some 41 years after their astute decision to award Davis her 1st Best Actress Oscar for Dangerous 2 years later By doing so the AFI may have been instrumental in bringing out the very best in one of Hollywood s most talented 20th century actors Because from Of Human Bondage onward Davis knew for certain that she had to reach deep inside of herself to find the performances that earned her the golden statue Doubtless she deserved more than 2 Oscars perhaps as many as 6 br br Dangerous provides an exemplary contrast in Davis depth of acting characterization For it s in Dangerous 1936 that she becomes the greatest actor of the 20th century Davis is so good as Joyce Heath she s dead center on the red carpet Whereas in Of Human Bondage Davis is right off the edge still on the sidewalk ready to take off on the rest of her 60 year acting career br br Perhaps by not awarding her that legendary Oscar in 1935 instead of a star being born an actor was given incentive to reach beyond stardom into her soul for the gifted actor s greatest work br br It is well known that her contemporary peer adversary was Joan Crawford a star whose performances still don t measure up to Davis Even Anna Nicole Smith was a star Howard Stern is a radio host star too Lots of people on stage the silver screen are stars Few became great actors The key difference between them is something that Bette Davis could sense the difference between the desire to do great acting or to become star struck br br Try comparing these two movies as I have viewing one right after the other Maybe you ll recognize what the AFI I did Davis was on the verge of becoming one of the greatest actors of the 20th century at 25yo achieved her goal by the time she was 27 She spent her next 50 plus years setting the bar so high that it has not been reached yet br br Had the AFI sent her the message that she d arrived in Of Human Bondage Davis life history as a great actor may have been led into star struck dom instead
Coming shortly before the imposition of a morality code darkened the spirits of writers directors and actors the first film adaptation of W Somerset Maugham s Of Human Bondage titillated countless moviegoers It has no shock value today just fine acting br br While the cast is excellent this is Bette Davis s first great role and one of Leslie Howard s best performances Howard is English wannabe Parisian artist Philip Carey who is gently and firmly told that he lacks any talent and that his dedication is no substitute for true genius Taking the lesson to heart he returns to London and enrolls in a medical college one by the way that seems to have no female students at that time there would have been at least a few Perhaps author physician Maugham didn t care for distaff medicos br br Having tea one day Carey is entranced by a waitress Mildred Rogers Bette Davis in a role as a morally loose and basically wicked farrago Her Cockney accent is as sharp as Eliza Doolittle s His repeated attempts to date her are greeted with the less than enthusiastic reply I don t mind a sure sign for any man with his head screwed on straight that he s plumbing the depths Maugham s Mildred supplemented her waitress tips with a bit of old fashioned street walking something not clearly brought out here br br Carey s besotted prostration serves Rogers avaricious need for support of the financial kind He is desperately in love with her she plays him as a Sunday church organist effortlessly plies her instrument No sex here Recognizing that he is getting nowhere he begins a chaste relationship with Norah a woman who adores him Re enter Mildred replete with a baby and in her usual need of being taken care of Exit heartbroken Norah br br Another separation from Mildred and Carey begins a long term friendship with Sally abetted enthusiastically by her dad who seems to view eventual marriage as both a good thing for the two young people and a chance to be relieved of one of his nine offspring br br The movie reasonably but not entirely follows Maugham s excellent novel Howard s Carey is naive and vulnerable and for much of the movie his sad eyes remind one of a doe facing a double barreled shotgun Mildred is unrestrainedly wicked a user of the worst kind her sole preoccupation with her own needs barely disguised when she tries to wheedle Carey with a thin patina of affectionate words and offers at one point she promises she ll do anything he wants a daring statement for the times and one I m sure audiences fully understood br br Pre Code it may be but Mildred s quick march dissolution would have satisfied the League of Catholic Decency The ending is conventional sin loses principled behavior triumphs br br Director John Cromwell wrought excellent performances from his two main stars one well established the other established largely because of this film The atmosphere is 1930s London and the trip back in time is worth taking br br Available on DVD br br 9 10 for Davis s and Howard s performances
How amazing this film is I ve seen it over and over throughout the years and I m always spellbound by it The reason why the film is so easy to re watch is of course the arresting performance given by the young Bette Davis She not only steals every scene that she s in but is actually much prettier and better photographed here not to mention sexier than she was in any of the films that she had made thus far at her home studio Warner Brothers this film was made by R K O Radio Pictures She wears a very flattering make up and has very attractive hairstyles and oh those lovely big eyes especially in the restaurant scenes that take place in London s Soho Her body was so curvy when she was young Get a load of it in the cheap negligee that she wears for her big explosive confrontation scene with Leslie Howard And oh boy she is an absolute powerhouse in that scene Howard is a little too nervous throughout but he does captures the hero s sensitivity Frances Dee scores as the sweet pretty young Sally who truly loves him Max Steiner s score is both charming and poignant Splendid performances and thirties flavor make this the must see version of the classic novel
Several features of this film immediately date it The sound is rather shrill and one realizes what great strides have been accomplished in sound reproduction in the ensuing years The language of the dialogue is rather quaint and unnatural and the acting is still reminiscent of its transition from the stage techniques br br Bette Davis always gives a strong performance in all her films as she does in this early period of her very successful career I do feel however that somehow the cockney accent does not fit the facial expression I think it is the assumed cockney accent that does not ring true for me br br Somerset Maughan loves to delve into human relationships of great dramatic intensity which will please all movie goers As in so many of her character roles Bette Davis can switch from a beautiful seductive woman to a viper full of fiery hatred Leslie Howard is well cast as the withdrawn English artist with a club foot desperately seeking a partner and making a bad choice in a scheming little waitress br br Towards the end of the film the young doctor meets his true love in a busy street They cross through the traffic completely oblivious to a multitude of horns and whistles screaming at them This scene is possibly meant to be funny but i find it quite ridiculous in this otherwise very serious film It is probably construed to send you home with a smile on your face And after all as far as we can see and hope for it is a happy ending
This movie even though it is over 70 years old is still a very moving strong film Bette Davis as the slutty vicious Cockney waitress Mildred is absolutely believable Watching her performance is still spellbinding She makes the viewer absolutely despise her and pity her at the same time Leslie Howard s performance as the weak obsessed Phillip Carey is not as strong but I don t see how any actor could hold their own against Ms Davis s performance She chews up the scenery in every scene she is in totally stealing the show This is the movie that sealed her stardom and she deserved to win the Academy Award but lost It was shocking for it s day what with themes of unwed pregnancy multiple sex partners and Mildred s vicious language so it is somewhat dated but still an excellent movie Just to see the scene where Mildred tells Phillip what she REALLY thinks of him You cad you dirty swine is still some of the greatest acting I have ever seen on film
SPOILER ALERT W Somerset Maugham classic on film about a love obsessed young man who s abused hurt and humiliated by the object of his obsession to the point of losing everything he has only to find true love in the end under the most unusual circumstances br br Leslie Howard plays the role of Philip Carey a sensitive young artiest in Paris trying to make a living by selling his paintings Told by a local art expert that his work is not at all good enough to be sold to the art going public Philip decides to go back to his native England and study medicine and become a physician in order to help others br br Philip being born with a club foot is very hypersensitive about his awkward condition and makes up for that by being a very pleasant and friendly person One afternoon Philip is at a local caf√© with a fellow medical student and spots pretty waitress Mildred Rogers Bette Davis and immediately falls in love with her Mildred at first rebuffs the love sick Philip but later realizing just what a sap he is takes advantage of his feelings for her Mildred has him spend himself into poverty buying her gifts and taking her out to the theater every time she off from work Phlip also falls behind on his studies by paying so much attention towards Mildred at the medical university and fails his final exams br br Going into hock buying an engagement ring for Mildred in an attempt to ask for her hand in marriage the cold hearted Mildred tells the startled Philip that she s already engaged to be married to Emil Miller Alan Hale It turns out that he s one of the customers at the caf√© that she s always flirting with br br Philip broke and heart sick slowly get his life back together and later retakes his medical exam and passes it and at the same time finds a new love in Nora Fay Johnson a writer for a local love magazine Later to Philip s shock and surprise Mildred walks back into his life br br Mildred telling Philip that her husband Emil who s child she s carrying threw her out of the house has the kind and understanding Philip take her back at the expense of Nora who was very much in love with him It later turns out that Mildred wasn t married to Emil but had a child out of wedlock by having an illicit affair with him Emil it turns out was already married br br As before Mildred takes advantage of Philip s kind heart for her and her baby daughter where he supports them with food medical attention and shelter to the point where he again goes broke and can t continue his studies ending with her leaving Philip after having a very heated and emotional encounter with him Out on the streets with nowhere to go Philip is taken in by Mr Athanly Reginald Owens who he once treated at the hospital and falls in love with his daughter Sally Frances Dee br br Later Philip has his club foot corrected at the medical center and with the help of Mr Athenly gets back to being a doctor It s then when he encounters Mildred again who s really at the end of her rope Dying of tuberculosis and having lost her daughter she s all alone with no one to look after her Philip now well to do and respected in medical circles does all he can to help the sick and poor Mildred but in the end she succumbed to her illness and passes away br br Mildred had the love and devotion in Philip all those years that he was in love with her but choose to abuse him and have affairs with man who were just like her cold unfeeling and selfish In the end Mildred got back just what she gave to the kind and sensitive Philip She became both unloved and alone Philip found in the sweet and caring Sally everything that Mildred wasn t and in the end also found the true love that he was looking for all of his life
Of the three remakes on W Somerset Maughan s novel this one is the best one and not particularly because what John Cromwell brought to the film The film is worth a look because of the break through performance by Bette Davis who as Mildred Rogers showed the film industry she was a star Finally her struggles with Jack Warner and his studio paid off royally br br The film is dominated by Mildred from the start We realize from the beginning that Mildred doesn t care for Philip and never will She doesn t hide her contempt for this kind soul that has fallen in love with the wrong woman He will be humiliated by Mildred again and again as she makes no bones about what she really is br br Poor Philip Carey besides of being handicap is a man who is weak When he tries to cling onto Mildred she rejects him It is when Mildred returns to him when she is frail and defeated that he rises to the occasion overcoming his own dependency on this terrible woman who has stolen his will and his manhood br br Bette Davis gives a fantastic portrayal of Mildred This was one of her best roles and she ran away with it Her disgust toward the kind Philip is clear from the onset of their relationship When she tells him she washes her mouth after he kisses her is one of the most powerful moment in the movie Leslie Howard underplayed Philip and makes him appear even weaker than he is Frances Dee Reginald Denny Alan Hale and Reginald Owen are seen in minor roles br br This is Bette Davis show and don t you forget it
After 21 movies and three years of working in Hollywood Bette Davis finally got a role she claimed as her own and which put her as a force to be reckoned with As Mildred Rogers Davis burst forth with a completely unsympathetic role of a slutty waitress who becomes the target of Leslie Howard s affections and already eager to sink her teeth into a role like this she had no qualms of the awful things her character was meant to do throughout the course of the film and the awful transformation she would undergo It also has been widely noted that her performance here one of the few things that makes this slightly uneven movie watchable has been the one to remember even after two remakes and the scenes where she rips into Howard have made cinema history br br At circa 85 minutes the story moves at a nice pace telling the story of Philip Carey Howard as his life crosses that of the destructive Mildred Rogers over and over again br br Howard and Davis chemistry is all but non existent Davis sustained in an interview much later in life she personally didn t care much for Howard s iciness towards her and that helped her act even worse in character towards him as Mildred All the same the two seem awkward with one another their scenes together remain stiff only salvaged by the ferocious acidity Davis brings to her lines and her own nervous presence Then again Cromwell s direction has a certain stiltedness about itself that fails to come through at times he tries to fill in some space whenever Davis is not there with dissolves and montages indicating the passing of time a calendar superimposed over a changing Frances Dee All much in the style back then This was before technicalities and complicated camera angles came into being and in essence the visual story is a simplified bare essentials translation of the Somerset Maugham s novel which is saying a lot since at 600 pages Of Human Bondage would have been indeed hard to film even then br br Storywise it feels that Philip Carey may be something of a glutton for punishment since there is no discernible sexual attraction between he and Mildred and to compound that Mildred never hides her displeasure from the get go Howard s performance never seems to go through much external emotion his eyes are constantly sad his expression never veers too far away from lost he could almost be a distant cousin to William Hurt in The Accidental Tourist dejected hurt and absolutely passive but this is possibly a part of his character and the reason he fails to see that other women played by Kay Johnson and Frances Dee are making themselves vulnerable to unrequited affections Interestingly Johnson s Norah once she realizes Carey will never fall for her is the one who sums the story up with her observation that people are bound to other people she is bound to Carey as Carey is bound to Mildred and Mildred herself is bound to Miller or men who fit the role of provider In her short but memorable scene she s the one who holds the essence of the story s moral
Brilliant film the next best film to The Drunken Master Jackie Chan I recently bought it on an original VHS and i haven t seen this film for 15 years but still as good as it was back then The acting was terrible and the dubbing was even worse but it those features that make this film and many other old fashioned Chinese kung fu movies great The choreography is awesome and the storyline is basic I have never seen the 36th chamber of shaolin but know it is the same film but Gordon liu plays San Te but San Te in Thr Return To The 36th Chamber is played by a different character It has a lot of comedy value and brilliant kung fu
I thought this would be a sequel to the original 36th Chamber of Shaolin but actually it s more of a light hearted sister to the original Gordon Liu still stars as a would be hero on a quest to learn kung fu to defeat those pesky Manchus but this time around it s lighter and more comedic The film centres around the local dye mill where wages are cut due to the hiring of 10 new Manchurian bosses Liu plays Chao who is able to fool the mill bosses into thinking he is a shaolin monk possessing almost magical kung fu skill But his luck runs out he is exposed as a fraud and he promises the mill workers that he will go to the Shaolin monastery to learn kung fu and return to protect them br br The comedy really begins at the monastery where Chao makes several bungling attempts to get accepted This sets up lots of really funny moments and lots of great fight choreography Continuing in the 36th Chamber tradition we see all kinds of neat and interesting and supremely hokey training methods at the monastery as well as creative uses of wooden benches as weapons br br Also unique and of note is the blending of kung fu and the craft of bamboo scaffold building Chao is not accepted as a student at Shaolin but is made to build bamboo scaffolding for the 10 year restoration of the monastery On the DVD I bought there is a special on bamboo scaffold building and the inspiration that director Lau Kar Leung drew from it This is a craft many hundreds perhaps thousands of years old and in Hong Kong scaffolding is still built of bamboo even on large high rises though the West exclusively uses steel tubes and clamps As a result of his scaffolding work Chao develops a special style of kung fu when asked what kind it is he hilariously replies scaffolding kung fu which he first tests during a dust up with the monastery s Abbot In the final confrontation with the Manchus there is a dazzling array of creative uses for bamboo poles and ties br br From a comedy perspective I think it s one of the best of the kung fu genre As a kung fu film in general it also stands out I recommend it to anyone
I saw this movie once on late night t v and knew it was the best movie ever This is one of the few Kung Fu movies with a decent plot The progression of the main character is seamless The whole movie is great
Return to the 36th Chamber is one of those classic Kung Fu movies which Shaw produces back in the 70s and 80s whose genre is equivalent to the spaghetti westerns of Hollywood and the protagonist Gordon Liu the counterpart to the western s Clint Eastwood Digitally remastered and a new print made for the Fantastic Film Fest this is Presented in Shaw Scope just like the good old days br br This film is a simple story of good versus evil told in 3 acts which more or less sums up the narrative of martial arts films in that era br br Act One sets up the premise Workers in a dye mill of a small village are unhappy with their lot having their wages cut by 20 by incoming manchu gangsters They can t do much about their exploitation because none of them are martial arts skilled to take on the gangsters and their boss At first they had a minor success in getting Liu to impersonate a highly skilled Shaolin monk one of the best comedy sequences but their rouse got exposed when they pushed the limit of credibility by impersonating one too many times br br Act Two shows the protagonist wanting to get back at the mob However without real martial arts he embarks on a journey to Shaolin Temple to try and infiltrate and learn martial arts on the sly After some slapstick moments he finally gets accepted by the abbot whom he impersonated but is disappointed at the teaching methods kinda like Mr Miyagi s style in Karate Kid but instead of painting fences he gets to erect scaffoldings all around the temple Nothing can keep a good man down and he unwittingly builds strength endurance and learns kung fu the unorthodox way br br Act Three is where the fight fest begins With cheesy sound effects each obvious non contact on film is given the maximum impact treatment But it is rather refreshing watching the fight scenes here with its wide angled shots to highlight clarity and detail between the sparring partners and the use of slow motion only to showcase stunts in different angles You may find the speed of fights a tad too slow with some pause in between moves but with Yuen Wo Ping and his style being used ad nausem in Hollywood flicks they sure don t make fight scenes like they used to Return to the 36th chamber gets a repeat screening on Monday so if you re game for a nostalgic trip down memory lane what are you waiting for
Return To The 3th Chamber is the comedic sequel to the epic 36th Chamber Of Shaolin in which Gordon Liu played Shan Te a young man who became a monk and awesome fighter In this sequel Liu plays a hapless loser who has to learn kung fu after causing his friends to be beaten He imitates the original Shan Te tries all manner of tricks to get into Shaolin Temple to learn and eventually gets some unique skills to fight some bullying bosses Its a classic light hearted martial arts tale with the ace production values of the Shaw Brothers and the sure footed direction of Lui Chia Liang The choreography is fantastic throughout whether for fighting or slapstick comedy and Gordon Liu s performance as are the others particularly the sympathetic monk work perfectly for the material The film is less epic or profound than some of the stars other work and there are certainly grander more violent and sweeping Shaw Brothers films But few have such a magical blend of slapstick unique training and fighting with a subtle yet warming tale of a useless guy making good Full of light hearted joy its impossible not to give this the highest score
This movie has a lot of comedy not dark and Gordon Liu shines in this one He displays his comical side and it was really weird seeing him get beat up His training is unorthodox and who would ve thought knot tying could be so deadly Lots of great stunts and choreography Very creative br br Add Johnny Wang in the mix and you ve got an awesome final showdown Don t mess with Manchu thugs they re ruthless
I agree with another user here and have to say that this is one of the best Kung Fu movies ever I watched this as a kid and absolutely loved it The scaffolding scenes are brilliant and you can really empathise with this guy because he is treated as an outcast Nice humour and fantastic kung fu this movie rocks If you like Kung Fu you would love this
This movie is one of the many Kung Fu action films made in Asia in the late 70s early 80s full of cheap sound effects dubbed dialog and lightning fast martial arts action But unlike most films of this genre it also has a decent plot and lots of great comedy When workers of a dye factory are forced out of their jobs by Manchu bullies they hire a con artist Gordon Liu to try to scare them off When his attempt fails miserably he cons his way into a Shaolin temple to learn to fight for real But instead of making him a Kung Fu student the Master instead orders him to build a scaffolding to cover the roofs of all 36 chambers Well it turns out that while he s performing these menial tasks stacking and tying bamboo poles that he s learning the skills to be a Kung Fu expert It s sort of like in Karate Kid when Mr Miagi teaches Daniel the basics of karate by having him do routine household chores Wax on wax off et cetera There s lots of great comedy from beginning to end and plenty of action at the end when Gordon Liu once again faces his Manchu tormentors This time it s not just tricks it s the real thing Liu declares proudly thumping his chest If you like classic Kung Fu films you don t want to miss this one
This is simply the epitome of what a made for TV movie should be It was a lazy Sunday afternoon when my wife and I were in grad school that we stumbled upon this The cheesy acting The poorly written script The good ol boys The ridiculous yet somehow obvious clich√© and banal premise The riding in pickup trucks with your propped up wife corpse It has it all br br You will meet familiar characters gold digging hussy stupid rich boy who wants to make it on his own friends who know better Daddy who knows better but drives son away And the wife corpse Propped up In a pick up br br Wow and the title Several things in our lives have been Texas Tragedies since watching this beauty Everyone involved in its creation deserves a medal
I just saw this movie on HBO and it was really good a tragic love story indeed I really appreciated the fact that the guy at the heart of the story had lost the use of his legs in an accident It s rare to see a love story involving someone who is physically handicapped The love that developed between that character and the woman who comes into his life nicely portrayed how I d like to think love can heal someone s heart Laura Leighton all of 27 when she made this movie was great as the woman so full of life she s able to revive this guy s heart Unfortunately since his family is wealthy and her s is not problems develop br br It s playing on HBO some more times this month Check out the schedule here http www hbo com apps schedule ScheduleServlet ACTION_DETAIL DETAIL FOCUS_ID 598947
this was a very good movie i wished i could find it in vhs to buy i really enjoyed this movie i would definaetly recommend this movie to watch i would like to see it again but can never find it in tv it would be well worth the time to watch it again
Yes a tap dancing horror thriller with Shelley and Debbie Goody Goody This is demented and campy fun and part of the guignol cycle of the 60s that leaked into the 70s Released as a double feature with the Burt Reynolds comedy FUZZ this mad scare is so bonkers as to be throughly entertaining Like a mix of DAY OF THE LOCUST THE OTHER and BABY JANE I suggest any prospective viewer take on the idea that this is almost meant to be skew iff and sit with someone with whom you can shriek and elbow all through it Actually get drunk whilst you watch it on cheap champagne Again with many 30s film ideas they are also about delusion the struggle of the time for a better life getting bitter and twisted by emotional madness falling into murder But this one is just plain crazy It also reminds me a lot of BLOODY MAMA the De Niro Winters shlock fest that makes this film look positively glorious
I had watched and recorded this a few years back on local TV and having been underwhelmed by it I subsequently erased the tape however when it was released by MGM as part of a Midnite Movie double feature DVD of Curtis Harrington Shelley Winters films for a very affordable price I couldn t resist giving it a second look this has since gone out of print Actually I received the DVD a few months ago but only now with Harrington s passing did I get to it thankfully this time around I was more receptive to the film and in fact now consider it one of the more satisfying WHATEVER HAPPENED TO BABY JANE 1962 imitations with whom incidentally it shared screenwriter Henry Farrell br br The film offers a splendid evocation of 1930s Depression America with its child star craze and sensational murders exploited during the fake newsreel opening it s stylishly made kudos to Lucien Ballard s cinematography and the set design by Eugene Lourie and boasts an effective David Raksin score Shelley Winters Debbie Reynolds and Michael MacLiammoir deliver excellent performances the latter is especially impressive as the larger than life and vaguely sinister diction coach though he ultimately proves a mere red herring Also featured are Dennis Weaver and Agnes Moorehead hers is only a cameo really as the evangelist she plays is mostly heard over the radio br br Many seemed to regret the inclusion of musical numbers by the kids including an amusing Mae West imitation but I personally wasn t bothered by them the film does slightly overstay its welcome due to an unhurried pace and perhaps needlessly convoluted plot Reynolds a musical star herself is ideally cast as the dancing school owner and despite their on set rivalry she and Winters work well together The latter in fact gives a more balanced depiction of paranoia and insanity than in WHOEVER SLEW AUNTIE ROO 1971 the narrative then comes up with a number of ironic twists that lead up to the expected Grand Guignol type denouement Apparently the film was toned down it originally contained more gore and even a suggestion of lesbianism by producer Martin Ransohoff against Harrington s wishes in order to get a PG rating
Some of the background details of this story are based very very loosely on real events of the era in which this was placed The story combines some of the details of the famous Leopold and Loeb case along with a bit of Aimee Semple McPherson br br The story begins with two mothers Shelley Winters and Debbie Reynolds being hounded as they leave a courtroom The crowd seems most intent on doing them bodily harm as their sons were just convicted of a heinous thrill crime One person in the crowd apparently slashes Winters hand as they make their way to a waiting car br br Soon after they arrive home they begin getting threatening phone calls so Reynolds suggests they both move to the West Coast together and open a dance school The dance school is s success and they cater to incredibly obnoxious parents who think their child is the next Shirley Temple One of the parents of these spoiled kids is a multimillionaire who is quite smitten with Reynolds and they begin dating Life appears very good But when the threatening phone calls begin again Winters responds by flipping out behaving like she s nearing a psychotic break and she retreats further and further into religion listening on the radio to Sister Alma almost constantly Again and again you see Winters on edge and it ultimately culminates in very bad things I won t say more as it might spoil this suspenseful and interesting film br br In many ways this film is a lot like the Bette Davis and Joan Crawford horror films of the 1960s like Whatever Happened to Baby Jane Straight Jacket and The Nanny While none of these are exactly intellectual fare on a kitsch level they are immensely entertaining and fun The writing is very good and there are some nice twists near the end that make it all very exciting Winters is great as a fragile and demented lady and Reynolds plays one of the sexiest 39 year olds I ve ever seen plus she can really really dance br br My only concern about all this is that some might find Winters hyper religiosity in the film a bit tacky like a cheap attack on Christianity At first I felt that way but when you meet Sister Alma she seems sincere and is not mocked so I took Winters religious zeal as just a sign of craziness which I assume is all that was intended br br By the way this film is packaged along with Whoever Slew Auntie Roo another Shelley Winters horror film from 1971 Both are great fun and quite over the top
The 1930s Classy elegant Adele marvelously played with dignified resolve by Debbie Reynolds and batty frumpy Helen the magnificent Shelley Winters going full tilt wacko with her customary histrionic panache are the mothers of two killers They leave their seamy pasts in the Midwest behind and move to Hollywood to start their own dance school for aspiring kid starlets Adele begins dating dashing millionaire Lincoln Palmer the always fine Dennis Weaver On the other hand religious fanatic Helen soon sinks into despair and madness br br Director Curtis Night Tide Ruby Harrington working from a crafty script by Henry Farrell who wrote the book Whatever Happened to Baby Jane was based on and co wrote the screenplay for Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte adeptly concocts a complex and compelling psychological horror thriller about guilt fear repression and religious fervor running dangerously amok The super cast have a ball with their colorful roles Michael MacLiammoir as a pompous elocution teacher Agnes Moorehead as a stern fire and brimstone radio evangelist Yvette Vickers as a snippy overbearing mother of a bratty wannabe child star Logan Ramsey as a snoopy detective and Timothy Carey as a creepy bum An elaborate talent recital set piece with Pamelyn Ferdin the voice of Lucy in the Peanuts TV cartoon specials serving as emcee and original Friday the 13th victim Robbi Morgan doing a wickedly bawdy dead on Mae West impression qualifies as a definite highlight David Raskin s spooky score a fantastic scene with Reynolds performing an incredible tango at a posh restaurant the flavorsome Depression era period atmosphere Lucien Ballard s handsome cinematography and especially the startling macabre ending are all likewise on the money excellent and effective MGM presents this terrific gem on a nifty DVD doublebill with Whoever Slew Auntie Roo both pictures are presented in crisp widescreen transfers along with their theatrical trailers
Well here s another terrific example of awkward 70 s film making The rudimentary premise of What s the matter with Helen is quite shocking and disturbing but it s presented in such a stylish and sophisticated fashion In the hands of any other movie crew this certainly would have become a nasty and gritty exploitation tale but with director Curtis Harrington Whoever Slew Auntie Roo and scriptwriter Henry Farrell Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte in charge it became a beautiful and almost enchanting mixture of themes and genres The basic plot of the film is definitely horrific but there s a lot more to experience like love stories a swinging 1930 s atmosphere and a whole lot of singing and tap dancing The setting is unquestionably what makes this movie so unique We re literally catapulted back to the 1930 s with a sublime depiction of that era s music religion theatrical business and wardrobes Following the long and exhausting trial that sentenced their sons to life imprisonment for murder Adelle Debbie Reynolds and Helen Shelley Winters flee to California and attempt to start a new life running a dance school for young talented girls Particularly Adelle adapts herself perfectly to the new environment as she falls in love with a local millionaire but poor old Helen continues to sink in a downwards spiral of insanity and paranoia She only listens to the ramblings of a radio evangelist fears that she will be punished for the crimes her son committed and slowly develops violent tendencies The script although not entirely without flaws is well written and the film is adequately paced There s never a dull moment in What s the matter with Helen although the singing tap dancing and tango sequences are quite extended and much unrelated to the actual plot But the atmosphere is continuously ominous and the film definitely benefices from the terrific acting performance of Shelley Winters She s downright scary as the unpredictable and introvert lady who s about to snap any second and especially during the last ten minutes or so she looks more petrifying than all the Freddy Kruegers Jason Voorhees and Michael Myers combined There are several terrific supportive characters who are sadly a little underdeveloped and robbed from their potential like Mich√©al MacLiamm√≥ir as the cocky elocution teacher Agnes Moorehead as the creepy priestess and Timothy Carey as the obtrusive visitor to the ladies house There are a couple of surprisingly gruesome scenes and moments of genuine shock to enjoy for the Grand Guignol fanatics among us but particularly the set pieces and costume designs even nominated for an Oscar are breathtaking
After their sons are sentenced to life in prison Adelle Debbie Reynolds and Helen Shirley Winters begin receiving threatening phone calls because someone fells their sons got off easy The pair decides to move to California to escape the publicity of the trial and to start a new life They start a dance school that is soon very successful One of the students has a rich unmarried father with whom Adelle quickly falls in love In the meantime Helen is busy raising rabbits and becoming a little too infatuated with an evangelist on the radio It s only a mater of time before everything falls apart and the women enter a world of madness and murder br br I can t help but compare What s the Matter with Helen to Whoever Slew Auntie Roo also starring Shelly Winters Where that movie seemed almost restrained in its presentation of Auntie Roo s madness there s nothing holding Helen back in this movie It may take a good deal of the movie s running time but once she snaps Helen is one Bad Mad Mutha You don t want to mess with her Winters is so delightfully demented that it was impossible for me not to enjoy her performance I m not going to spoil the movie but the things Helen is capable of are totally over the top br br As good as Winters is Reynolds is totally ridiculous in her role as the gold digging tap dancer I got the impression that she thought she was in a movie that would get her nominated for some award This ain t Citizen Kane Quit acting so serious Hey Debbie don t you realize that you re main purpose is to be a victim of Winters insanity br br I just love these former female stars in the twilight of their career horror movies What s the Matter with Helen is as fun as any
A vastly underrated black comedy the finest in a series of grand guignol movies to follow Baby Jane Reynolds and Winters are mothers of young convicted murderers a nod to Compulsion who run away to hide in Hollywood They run a school for would be movie tots a bunch of hilariously untalented kids attended by awful stage moms Debbie in her blonde wig I m a Harlow you re more a Marion Davies she tells Winters leads the tots at their concert and wins a rich dad Weaver She also does a deliciously funny tango and over all gives an outstanding performance unlike anything she d done before The atmosphere is a fine mix of comic and eerie It looks wonderful with great period detail 30 s Lots of lovely swipes at Hollywood and the terrifying movie tot Micheal MacLiammoir has a ball as the drama coach Hamilton Starr he purrs two r s but prophetic nonetheless See it and love it
From the writer of What Ever Happened to Baby Jane and Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte this tail end of the sixties horror cycle has some eerie and campy fun Miche√°l Macliamm√≥ir does a Victor Buono type bit but too often the movie totters dangerously close to a bad musical there s a particularly awful children s recital about halfway through Debbie taps tangos and tricks up a l√° Harlow while Winters religious fanatic has a lesbian edge to her Agnes Moorehead checks in as an evangelist Weaver has nothing to do and even has to pay a gigolo to dance with Debbie
The most bizarre of the cinematic sub genres is the so called The Great Ladies of the Grand Guignol camp horror films which combined over the top melodrama with gothic thrills and always starred by seasoned and almost forgotten actress from hollywood golden age in unflattering roles of either long suffering victims or screeching evil harpies This genre provided them with an unusual acting showcase that allowed strut their stuff on the screen once again and win new generations of fans at expense of their glamorous images from yesterday br br What s the matter with Helen is the last drop of this sub genre with stunning performances of both Debbie Reynolds and Shelley Winters as the troubled mothers of two convicted criminals who run away from their past to the sunny California in the 1930s to open a talent school to milk out the eagerly mothers who want their daughters to be the next Shirley Temple In California Debbie gets happiness clients tango tap dancing and a new love interest Dennis Weaver meanwhile Shelley gets wacko with horrible flashbacks menacing anonymous calls menacing strangers menacing Agnes Moorehead as a radio evangelist cute little rabbits and an unfortunate encounter with an electric fan ouch br br The sloppy script penned by Henry Farrell the man who started all this genre with Whatever Happened to Baby Jane along with master director Robert Aldrich Joan Crawford and Bette Davis is full of plot holes red herrings and wasted opportunities that could had made this movie great the underlying themes of twisted motherhood with Debbie and Shelley s characters as failed mothers and the overbearing mommies of the child stars and obsessive female bonding Debbie and Shelley relationship and the fact that the few male characters of this movie are either sinister or sleazy even Dennis Weaver dream boat Texan are wasted Instead we get Debbie Reynolds musicals interludes and dancing tots although fun to watch take too much screen time of what is supposedly to be a psychological chiller But still this movie is highly entertaining The two stars and Curtis Harrington stylish direction easily overcomes its flaws The movie recreation of the 1930 s is colorful and elegant look at Debbie s clothes made with a very tight budget The increasing atmosphere of madness and hysteria is genuinely creepy with a shocking finale that will haunt you for days And you wouldn t easily forget that silly Goody goody song that runs through the movie either And seeing an increasingly mad Shelley Winters screw every one of Debbie Reynolds chances at happiness is a hoot to watch br br 8 out of 10
I found the film quite expressive the way the main character was lost but at the same much more clear about certain things in life than people who mocked him his flatmate for example br br he was tortured and you loved to watch him being tortured it had this perverted side which was frightening but we were all happy to see him come out of the misery again br br it was like a game character or pan man through a mine land or to enemy and we love to watch him under sniper attack or fire but then at the end we are happy to see him survive br br
In a year of pretentious muck like Synecdoche New York a film born out of Charlie Kaufman s own self indulgence comes a film that is similarly hard to watch but about three times as important Frownland is a labor of love by the crew the actors and the filmmaker shot over years by friends It traces a man who cannot communicate through his thoroughly authentic REAL Brooklyn world The people that you see are a step beyond even the stylization of the mumblecore movement They are real people painfully trapped in their own self contained neuroses unwilling to change unable The real world to them is their own set of delusions and because this is a film about people who are so profoundly out of touch it is very difficult to watch It is 16mm film making without proper light money or any of the other factors that would make a film slick but its honesty can not be understated a fact that would cause a room full of people to dismiss it and for Richard Linklater to give it an award as he did at SXSW This does remind of films like Naked or the best of the mumblecore It is a film that is not for everyone but one that challenges you to watch and grows on you the longer you think about it
Frownland is like one of those intensely embarrassing situations where you end up laughing out loud at exactly the wrong time and just at the moment you realize you shouldn t be laughing you ve already reached the pinnacle of voice resoundness and as you look around you at the ghostly white faces with their gaping wide open mouths and glazen eyes you feel a piercing ache beginning in the pit of your stomach and suddenly rushing up your throat and well you get the point br br But for all its unpleasantness and punches in the face Frownland really is a remarkable piece of work that after viewing the inarticulate mess of a main character and all his pathetic troubles and mishaps makes you want to scratch your own eyes out and at the same time you feel sickenly sorry for him br br It would have been a lot easier for me to simply walk out of Ronald Bronstein s film but for some insane reason I felt an unwavering determination to stay the course and experience all the grainy irritation the film has to offer If someone sets you on fire you typically want to put it out Stop Drop And Roll But with this film you want to watch the flame slowly engulf your entire body You endure the pain perhaps out of spite or some unknown masochistic curiosity I can t even begin to attempt to explain br br Unfortunately mainstream cinema will never let this film come to a theater near you But if you get a chance to catch it prepare yourself bring a doggie bag
A very strange and compelling movie It s about a very awkward and tightly wound man who attempts to navigate his life as a door to door fundraiser salesman The director was able to capture a very unnerving tone that really served the story well Original and unsettling while also finding a great deal of humor in the pain that accompanies life There is a sequence at a testing facility that really stood out and made me laugh out loud which is not something I do as frequently as I should One of the more memorable films I ve seen in a long while Hasn t left my mind and I look forward to future efforts by Bronstein Fantastic performances all around The simple line I really appreciate it is now iconic to me
What happens when someone has so much social anxiety that they cease to function How alone can one man get When the mundane crap we have to do in order to be part of society gets to be too much what happens Frownland explores these questions Definitely a startling original debut from Bronstein The tone is strange and claustrophobic as we get inside the mind of a guy named Keith that is so messed up he can hardly form a proper sentence We follow him around as he tries to make contact with people and function day to day Most of us have known people like this people that say sorry too much or i appreciate it when there s nothing to appreciate So we know there are people out there like this but why would someone want to make a movie about them Well because its interesting and Bronstein and the lead actor Dore Mann do an excellent job This film is about as un commercial as a film can get A few friends filmed it over the course of a few years as they saved money It was shot on 16mm and the scratched film look is beautifully low budget With no distributer this may be a tough one to find I think it s been screening randomly for the past year or so Hopefully it ll be on DVD at some point I saw it at the Silent Movie Theater here in LA There were 10 people in the audience among them Crispin Glover if that tells you anything about how weird this movie is Highly recommended
A Guy Thing may not be a classic but it sure is a good funny comedy The plot focuses on Paul Jason Lee who wakes up the morning after his bachelor party with no memory and Becky Julia Stiles lying naked in his bed Before he can figure out what happened he rushes Becky out of his apartment because his fiance Karen Selma Blair is coming After that as you could imagine chaos ensues br br Almost every single scene in A Guy Thing delivers loud laughs The funniest moments come from when Paul imagines what could happen if he tells Karen Selma Blair is a truly talented comedian and the worst thing about this film is that she goes underused Although she turns out to be more funny than Stiles character who actually isn t that interesting Of course not every comedy is perfect br br As I said A Guy Thing is no classic but it s not bad either 7 10
On the night of his bachelor party Paul Coleman Jason Lee meets the gorgeous dancer Becky Julia Stiles in the bar they drink a lot together and in the next morning he wakes up with her on the bed His future mother in law calls him and informs that his fianc√©e Karen Selma Blair might be arriving in his apartment and he desperately asks Becky to leave his place in a hurry Sooner he finds that her has crabs and later in the preparation of his wedding dinner party he realizes that Becky is the cousin of Karen This is the beginning of a very funny comedy with hilarious situations The first attraction of this movie certainly is the central trio of actresses and actor Julia Stiles and Selma Blair who are excellent actresses and extremely gorgeous and Jason Lee who is amazingly funny have good performances I laughed a lot along the story but there are some scenes that are really hilarious For example when Paul finds Becky in his bed when he finds her paints his imagination in many situations in the drugstore trying to buy and get explanations about the crab medicine most of the scenes of his neighbor the minister when Karen calls the department store or when the police finds a suspect of assaulting Paul I could number many other scenes but better off the reader rent or buy this movie and have lots of fun My vote is seven br br Title Brazil Louco Por Elas Crazy For Them
Romantic comedies can really go either way you know You ll see one that s really sappy and you ll think you want something more realistic Then you ll see one that s realistic but it might be too dull to keep you interested Or maybe you ll see one that does everything right but just fails to make you smile Romantic comedies are tough movies You go into them with a lot of expectations and usually whether you like it is simply a matter of whether the filmmakes was anticipating your expectations or those of the guy or girl next to you br br Of course if you ve got a girl next to you and you re a guy like me it probably doesn t matter all that much whether the movie s any good you ve got other things on your mind For you I say Go get her Tiger For the rest of us I say See _A Guy Thing_ It s a lot of fun br br Because _A Guy Thing_ knows you re going in to this movie with expectations so it doesn t pretend that its Guy about to get married meets the woman of his dreams and it s not his wife plot is going to make everyone happy Sure maybe you like it but maybe it doesn t ring true or you think it s cruel _A Guy Thing_ covers that What _A Guy Thing_ does is fill the screen with the best supporting cast I ve seen in a long time so if you don t the main plotline you ve still got something to make you smile br br Whether we re talking about the seasoned veterans of big and small screen like Larry Miller Pretty Woman Best in Show James Brolin Traffic Julie Hagerty Airplane David Koechner Saturday Night Live and Conan O Brien regular Dirty Work Austin Powers II or Thomas Lennon The State and Viva Variety or new faces like Shawn Hatosy The Faculty or Colin Foo Saving Silverman we re talking about a bunch of very talented and skilled actors who know exactly how to take advantage of the film s inspired characterisation steal the show time after time and still frame the piece with an energy and a joy rarely seen in romantic comedies these days br br And that s not to detract from the actual romantic throughline and the stars that carry it along because it s very sweet and terribly well done Jason Lee Mallrats Chasing Amy Dogma etc is touching as the young professional whose life may be spinning out of control and Selma Blair shows an understated brilliance in portraying the aspiring socialite and sophisticated career woman every guy wants to marry except for the guy who actually is br br A lot of the success of the movie though falls on Julia Stiles the right girl in the right place at the wrong time and she wears it well Not since gosh I don t know when have I seen an actress in a romantic comedy that has made falling in love with her so easy Of course it s all in the closeups the voice and the subtle smiles but it s magical and it s one of the big reasons why we go to the movies in the first place br br But Julie Stiles s slightly offbeat sophistication would be lost were it not for the fact that the rest of the cast is so incredibly dead on in their classic simplicity This is a movie that paints a broken world of irreconcilable stock types makes them fall over each other to make you laugh and then comes through with a great deal of heart br br A Guy Thing is a movie you ve definitely seen before and the filmmakers clearly knew that when they set down to make it We haven t really seen any new romantic comedies since Shakespeare the relative success of this one or that one is entirely dependent upon the execution of the classic story of boy meets girl A Guy Thing does embrace that with a bit of a metacinematic edge often taking the scenes into the absurd in order to give the audience a chance to acknowledge the powerful emotions and ancient plot devices at play br br For the record it also even manages to poke fun at the rather traditional structural notions of sex and gender that form the center of every romantic comedy so even the feminists out there might get a kick out of it br br And guys I think we can all agree that we wish our friends are as cool as Jason Lee s friends in this movie I m not going to spoil it for you but when you try to explain to your girlfriend why the pharmacist and the clothing store clerk are among the coolest dudes in cinema I suggest you just say It s a Guy Thing and leave it at that
I was literally preparing to hate this movie so believe me when I say this film is worth seeing Overall the story and gags are contrived but the film has the charm and finesse to pull them off That gag where Jason Lee thinks he has crabs and tries not to let his boss future father in law and co workers see him scratching himself isn t terribly intelligent but it sent me into a frenzy of laughter Very few of the film s gags are high brow but they made me laugh As I said the film has charm and charm can go a long way br br The characters are likable too I must say I wish I got to see more of James Brolin s character since he was a hoot in the very few scenes he was in Plus I admire any romantic comedy that has the guts to not make the character of the wife who serves as the obstacle in the plot a total witch The Selma Blair character is hardly unlikable and there s never a scene where I thought to myself Why did he want to marry her in the first place The ending is Hollywood ish but it could ve been much more schmaltzy br br The cast is talented I haven t had a favorable view of most of Jason Lee s mainstream work I just loved him so much in Kevin Smith s films that I couldn t help but feel disappointed at seeing him in these dopey roles And he never looks comfortable in these dopey roles Even in this movie he doesn t look perfectly comfortable but he contributes his own two cents and effectively handles each scene But I still miss his work in independent films Julia Stiles proves again why she s so damn likable Of course she s a very beautiful girl with a radiant smile that makes me want to faint but she also possesses a unique charm and seems to have good personality In other words her beauty shows inside and out I don t know the actresses name but the woman who plays the drunk granny is hilarious Julie Hagerty also has a small part and she s always enjoyable to watch which makes me wish she received better roles I loved her so much in Airplane and Lost in America that it s a shame she doesn t get the same opportunities to flaunt her skills br br Don t be put off by the horrible trailers and even more horrible box office records This is a funny charming film Romantic comedies are getting so predictable nowadays that it feels like the genre itself is ready to be flushed down the toilet so it s always to see a good one among all these bad apples br br My score 7 out of 10
This movie starts out brisk has some slow moments in the middle but generally moves along well has a few very good moments then peters out at the end of Act 3 I was able to get to see this in LA premieres 2 times with 2 different endings Jason Lee is a star but he is not tomorrows leading man He is humorous and holds his own but he is better served as a supporting actor Julia Stiles does ok in a comedy role new for her but she doesn t steal this movie the way a star of her caliber should For an actress who has so much potential 10 Things Save the Last Dance O it is hard to watch her continue to do roles that are so average and then not have her take the role and run away with the movie like Daniel Day Lewis did in Gangs Selma Blair is a good young actress as well and does an ok job I didn t expect an academy award performance from her and she didn t deliver one but her performance was adequate Chris Koch delivers another film that is above average Perhaps the problem lies in the script more than anything else I did like this movie But it is not a movie where you walk away and say that was great This story has been done so many times before and there was just not much new here The rehearsal dinner scene was probably the best in the movie and Larry Miller gives an incredible performance in a supporting role he could be the best surprise of the film If you want to go see a movie that will make you laugh a few times and have an enjoyable evening I can still recommend this film but unless they have changed the ending again leave during the church scene or you will surely be disappointed
First a quick shut up to those saying this movie stinks You can t go to every movie expecting Citizen Kane This was actually a fun movie Jason Lee is good in everything he does The only flaw in this movie is I don t think there was enough chemestry between Lee and Julia Stiles They should have dwelled more on that Other than that the movie is good fun Selma Blair needs to eat something She s worrying me But she still looks beautiful So yes I recommend this movie for a date or light saturday afternoon fun Go see br br RATING 1 2 out of
I think the deal with this movie is that it has about 2 minutes of really really funny moments and it makes a very good trailer and a lot of people came in with expectations from the trailer and this time the movie doesn t live up to the trailer It s a little more sluggish and drags a little slowly for such an exciting premise and i think i m seeing from the comments people having a love hate relationship with this movie br br However if you look at this movie for what it is and not what it could have been considering the talent of the cast i think it s still pretty good Julia Stiles is clearly the star she s so giddy and carefree that set among the conformity of everyone else she just glows and the whole audience falls in love with her along with Lee The rest of the cast of course Lee s testosterone filled coworkers his elegant mother in law his fratlike friend Jim and his bride to be all do an excellent job of fitting into stereotypes of conformity and boringness that make Stiles stand out in the first place br br Lee doesn t live up to his costars i don t think but you could view that as more that they re hard to live up to Maybe that s one source of disappointment br br The movie itself despite a bit of slowness and a few jokes that don t come off as funny as the writer s intended is still pretty funny and I found a rather intelligent film The themes of conformity and taking the safe route seemed to cleverly align on several layers For example there was the whole motif of how he would imagine scenarios but would never act on them until the last scene or how he was listening to a radio program on the highway talking about how everyone conforms or just how everything selma blair and julia stiles characters said and did was echoed by those themes of one person being the safe choice and one being the risky choice br br The other good thing about the movie was that it was kind of a screwball comedy in which Jason Lee has to keep lying his way through the movie and who through dumb luck example the pharmacy guy turning out to be a good chef and some cleverness on his part gets away with it for the most part br br While it wasn t as funny as i expected and there was a little bit of squandered talent but overall it s still a good movie
What would you say about a man who was about to get married and was having his bachelor party with some of his closest friends at a Hawaiian guy bar All smooth sailing until he takes his bachelor hat off What would you say about him talking to one of the suggestive dancers and then sleeping with her What would you say if that exact girl was the cousin of his finance A new low right Well Paul Coleman played comically by Jason Lee leads this experience of a nauseous blur and a new low I got to say this is one of his good leading roles However I do believe his role in Vanilla Sky was better acted br br His finance named Karen is played by the up and down actress Selma Blair while Karen s character Becky is played by the lovely and talented Julia Stiles Getting back to where we left off Paul now has to deal with one arising problem to another He gets diseases has to deal with certain people and has to play his lie games with stealth or any member of each of the families could get P O ed including one of his relatives that hasn t had a bowel movement for 14 days Vomit All of this leads to the long awaited wedding with one hilarious scene before it recapping all the hell that Paul and his brother had to go through br br Overall A Guy Thing is quite funny and is all right Sometimes the story may seem to go nowhere and you get tired of scenes here and there but it s a mixed movie And if you re a Canadian and a fellow fan of the CTV Brett Butt sitcom Corner Gas you d recognize a small role played by Fred Ewanuick the same man who plays the hilarious Hank in the series This movie is all right It s another feather in Lee s hat quite an empty hat so far however br br My Rating 7 10 br br Eliason A
Paul Jason Lee is an underachiever who just happens to be engaged to a type A princess named Karen Selma Blair She chooses his clothes and his daily schedule At his bachelor party Paul gets a little too drunk and somehow ends up taking a pretty dancer named Becky Julia Stiles back to his digs Nothing happened as they say but the duo do wake up in the same bed Suddenly Karen telephones She s on her way to Paul s apartment Understandably Paul hustles Becky out of the place although her underpants are left behind But there is even more fun ahead At a family dinner at Karen s parents home Paul runs smack into Becky again learning that she is Karen s cousin Talk about some explaining to do But instead Paul chooses to feign a stomach problem and hides out in the bathroom Will Karen ever find out that Becky spent the night at Paul s place And what will be the consequences I m sorry for critics who pan movies like this They should definitely lighten up for this film is fresh and fun Of course it doesn t hurt matters that Lee is a consummate funny man Stiles is a charming beauty or that Blair is a natural as a pretty but anal fianc√©e The rest of the cast including James Brolin and Julie Haggerty is also quite nice The look of the film is wonderful as are the costumes and California settings Best of all the script is imaginative and inspired creating big laughs for the audience In short if you want to tickle the proverbial funnybones get this movie tonight It may not be Academy Award material but it is absolutely guaranteed to turn a bad day into a darn good one
Recap The morning after his bachelor party Paul is woken by his mother in law to be and discovers that there is a woman sleeping beside him Unfortunately its a waitress from the bar and not his fianc√©e And suddenly she turns up everywhere the toll booth at the freeway and at his parent in laws dinner And it is hard to keep a secret when her jealous ex boyfriend had him followed and photographed It is not only about saving his wedding it is about survival br br Comments Actually much better than expected Not the sweet romantic comedy I expected but something much funnier something with a little edge This movie wasn t afraid to take the jokes a little further And Jason Lee does now how to deliver comedy especially when his character is half panicked and deep in trouble as he is here And he got nice support from beautiful ladies Julia Stiles and Selma Blair And actually I thought Lochlyn Munro did a nice part as the ex br br So more emphasis on comedy than romance and the end result was good I enjoyed it very much br br 7 10
I think this movie got a low rating because it got judged by it s worst moments There is a diarrhea joke and an embarrassing nut scratching scene but apart from that there are actually quite a few moments that made me laugh out loud Jason Lee is performing some wonderfully subtle comedy in this movie and Julia Stiles manages to be pretty damn funny herself Apart from that this movie behaves like most romantic comedies after about 40 minutes into it you know how it is going to end Which is better than most of them where you already know after 5 minutes Anyway better movies to watch but definitely not the worst pick Cheers
I happened to watch this movie by chance some days ago while flipping channels My expectations were not very high but it was an interesting movie In A Guy Thing Jason Lee plays Paul a straight laced Seattle based fellow who is about to marry his fianc√©e Karen Selma Blair and settle down to an unchallenging life of middle class domesticity We first meet Paul at his bachelor party where he professes no desire to engage in any of the normal bachelor party type activities his surprisingly few buddies encourage in case he s a bit naughty and gets into hot bother with his soon to be trouble and strife Of course the next thing Paul knows it s the morning after the night before he s in bed with a naked hula dancer and his mother in law phones to inform him that Karen is on her way over Oh and the hula dancer is Karen s cousin Becky Julia Stiles br br From this small acorn of potential trouble grows a mighty oak of frenetic misfortune as Paul scrabbles from misadventure to misadventure trying to cover up what he s done whilst keeping up the appearance of being a dutiful family oriented good guy who s super excited about his forthcoming nuptials His efforts to ensure Karen remains none the wiser about any potential wrong doing on his part ironically forces Paul closer and closer to the fun loving Becky forcing him to question whether he really wants the life that seems to have been mapped out for him The movie contains the right mix of comedy and romance Definitely worth a watch
In my opinion A GUY THING is a hilarious witty sexy romantic and totally beautiful chick flick that guys will also enjoy I thought that Jason Lee and Julia Stiles dazzled as a bewildered groom to be and his soon to be sexy cousin in law If you ask me they lit up the screen like magic You can also feel their chemistry between them Before I wrap this up I d like to say that the performances were top grade the direction was flawless the production design was nice the casting was perfect and the costumes were perfectly designed In conclusion to anyone who s a fan of Jason Lee or Julia Stiles I recommend this movie You re in for lots of laughs and thrills so go to the video store rent it or buy it kick back with a friend and watch it
The Lady from Shanghai is well known as one of Hollywood s most troubled productions Welles original cut was taken away by the producers and cut to ribbons This made the already muddled mystery story even more difficult to keep track of They post dubbed a good amount of his dialog because of the density of the Irish accent and the dubbing is all too apparent and poorly done Most disastrous of all Welles and his on screen and real life leading lady Rita Hayworth were falling apart in their relationship and their tumultuous chemistry comes through on screen br br Fortunately this is all overcome by just how fantastic Orson Welles direction is He makes the film incredibly stylish and atmospheric every scene just seems to be breathing down your back from the screen Also the characters and scenes are so bizarre they border on dreamlike and surreal This sense of weirdness elevates scenes that are often found in these films such as the courtroom sequences in the middle I typically find courtroom dramas a bore but Welles direction and quirky touches make them just as fascinating as everything else The ending at the carnival reminds one of David Lynch almost br br The acting here is also very good Despite their failing relationship Welles and Hayworth both give decent performances their interactions however are just a bit lacking Everyone else is superb and delightful to watch though especially Everett Sloane and Glenn Anders The Lady from Shanghai obviously has its problems but its worth watching just to see one of cinema s masters at his finest 8 10
I did no research on the film prior to my first viewing of it because it was part of a Welles box set I had recently purchased A box set I chiefly got because I wanted to own A Man For All Seasons and to also re evaluate Waterloo So I stick Orson and Rita in the player and I m treated to class and confusion in equal measure br br On the surface the story seemed a simple one man meets gorgeous woman and saves her from a couple of thugs they click straight away and man gets offer of work on a cruise with woman and her famous lawyer husband and then br br well it becomes murder mystery of plotted devilment and much shenanigans Michael O Hara Orson Welles himself doesn t really know what is going on he is as confused as the viewer is and that is wonderful to watch as he is pulled all over the place by pretty much everyone in the film Obviously being pulled by the heart strings by a femme fatale of such beauty as Elsa Bannister Rita Hayworth has its moments but you just know that things are going to go pear shaped br br So many wonderful things in the film it has Welles visual style all over it see a scene in an aquarium that is marvellous and the ending sequences in a fun house is majestic on the eye The narration from O Hara is joyously self mocking and we get good light relief by way of a court case with Everett Sloane considerably lighting up proceedings br br Yet the film is an oddity and in fact it s a choppy viewing experience because as I was to find out after studio bosses cut the film by pretty much a whole hour and that is just not only frustrating to us the viewer but unfair on Welles vision I m positive that a full original cut of this film would have been lauded and revered wholesale as it is tho we have a very good and intriguing film one that sadly only hints at greatness but remains a fiendishly engrossing film that I m glad I own to revisit further 8 5 10
One reviewer notes that it does not seem to matter what Welles actually says or does he moves you I concur He was and remains a unique force in film More than a triple threat who could act write and direct he had a genius uniquely suited to film One can consider whether in an earlier age he would have been a painter This film certainly reinforces that impression A musician a theatre actor an heir to Shakespeare hard to tell but I am very grateful that his time cam with film and he have him captured on film I like the accent I like the face the size the style the mind and the games I love all of his movies and wish there were more I particularly love how other actors interacted with him on film Many were never better or at least somehow different with him because he was o firmly there Even towards the end when his beauty was ruined perhaps by his own intent he was impossible to ignore and he made every scene he was in Rita was a gorgeous blonde a Lana Turner look alike but perhaps even lovelier and even then the eye goes to Welles and one wishes for another minute another film another hour in his company That is why we all wish we could come upon the lost scraps cut from his films because we know we all know that there is not part of him not worthy of our time Watch it and be grateful for the chance
In a lot of his films Citizen Kane Confidential Report Touch of evil Orson Welles gave him the role of an exuberant men In The Lady from Shanghai it s the only time I see him holding the role of the victim The role of the culprit he gave it to Rita Hayworth I guess it s because he was in love with her Therefore it s an interesting film But I find the story excellent too The direction is genius as usual with Welles two scenes are particularly brilliant the one in the aquarium and the final one with the mirrors This film is brilliant 10 10
THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI is proof that the great genius Orson Welles could direct a mainstream movie if he wanted to By comparison to his other more artistic works this film has only a moderate amount of craftiness and almost no esoteric elements br br The exception being of course the final scene in the hall of mirrors widely agreed to be one of the greatest scenes in the history of film It alone is worth the cost of a rental br br The sweet surprise was the superb acting by the beautiful Rita Hayworth Her acting during the beginning and middle of the film is so excellent she made the other actors appear as caricatures instead of characters Even the great Mr Welles
It is not as great a film as many people believe including my late aunt who said it was her favorite movie But due to the better sections of this film noir particularly that justifiably famous fun house finale THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI has gained a position of importance beyond it s actual worth as a key to the saga of Orson Welles failure to conquer Hollywood br br By 1946 Welles position as a Hollywood figure was mixed CITIZEN KANE was not recognized as the great movie it has since been seen as due to the way it was attacked by the Hearst press and by Hollywood insiders themselves Welles attempt at total control direction and production and acting of his movies seemed to threaten the whole system His best job in this period was as Edward Rochester in JANE EYRE supposedly shot by Robert Stevenson but actually shot in large measure with Stevenson s blessing by Welles But the credit went to Stevenson Only THE STRANGER a film benefiting from a postwar interest in fleeing Nazi war criminals made a profit For five years in Hollywood it was barely a great record br br Welles returned to Broadway in 1946 hoping to recapture his critical abilities by his production of AROUND THE WORLD IN 80 DAYS But despite the assistance Mike Todd and Cole Porter composing the score the musical was a failure His failure occurred just at the same time that his wife Rita Hayworth was on the rise with her portrayal of GILDA So the marriage was going on the rocks as well br br Welles had to make money his Broadway production had led to his personal bankruptcy He sold his interest in the possible movie rights to AROUND THE WORLD to Todd which he would eventually rue and he also sold the idea of a film about the career of Henri Desire Landru to Charlie Chaplin who was supposed to be directed in it and who turned it into MONSIEUR VERDOUX br br The story goes that Welles with a 10 000 00 tax bill to worry about called Cohn and offered to do a film with Rita for a down payment Cohn was willing to do so but naturally asked what the film was It was a wise question Welles was on a pay phone in New York in a pharmacy that had a book department He grabbed a book with the title THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI and raved that it was a great thriller Somehow Welles convinced the normally astute Cohn that Welles knew what he was talking about Cohn said he d look into getting the rights and sent Welles his down payment of 10 000 00 After Cohn hung up Welles bought the book and read it and found it was really pretty bad He spent time rewriting a treatment and screenplay that would build up Rita s character of Elsa Bannister br br Certainly it has a curious plot development Michael O Hara is a seaman longshoreman He rescues Elsa Bannister when she is apparently attacked by gangsters in a park in San Francisco Elsa is married to Arthur Bannister Everett Sloane a crippled criminal lawyer with a great reputation She convinces him to hire Michael as the skipper of their yacht The cruise also contains Bannister s sinister partner George Grisby Glenn Anders and one Sidney Broome Ted De Corsia who turns out to be a detective hired by Bannister to watch Elsa When they can Michael and Elsa try to find time together but Broome or Grisby keeps showing up br br Grisby makes Michael an offer he wants for reasons connected to his so called fatalistic view of modern society to drop out of it pretending to be dead According to Grisby the plot becomes murky here he can still collect his life insurance although dead and use it to run off to the South Seas He will pay Michael 10 000 00 if he will pretend to shoot Grisby This includes actually signing a document admitting to the murder Michael does not realize that such an admission would wipe out the need to produce a corpse if all the other evidence suggests that Grisby is probably dead br br Of course Grisby is killed and Michael is arrested for that and for the murder of Broome shot with Michael s gun Michael is tried with Bannister defending him and discovers that the latter is doing a second rate job because he wants Michael to be convicted Michael is convinced that Bannister is the actual murderer and manages to escape just before the jury verdict He is knocked out and deposited in a deserted carnival and this leads to the famous fun house sequence and the conclusion of the film br br It s a terribly confusing movie as I have had commented on That does not mean it s not worth seeing visually it is striking Witness the fight between Michael and the police in the trial judge s quarters where he knocks the bailiff into the judge s bookcase shattering glass Or the clever use of photography to capture Hayworth diving from a rock reflected on the lecherous Grisby s binoculars br br The acting is pretty good in particular Sloane possibly that fine actor s best film role Glenn Anders was a leading Broadway performer He rarely made movies before THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI and his slimy Grisby is unforgettable Also Ted De Corsia does very nicely with Broome a detective who is really looking for his own interests to his own cost br br As for Hayworth she turns in a performance that was unlike most of what she had done before BLOOD AND SAND TALES OF MANHATTAN and THE STRAWBERRY BLOND are exceptions and is a memorable siren Welles O Hara is a very unusual character for the actor a likable but naive man who learns the hard way not to believe what he secretly wants to believe It s not KANE AMBERSOMS OTHELLO TOUCH OF EVIL or CHIMES AT MIDNIGHT but it is a good film for all that
Neatly sandwiched between THE STRANGER a small film noir picture that proved Welles can do a formidable genre work on budget and on time and ironically proved his biggest box office success in the forties and MACBETH a no budget Shakespeare adaptation shot in old western shets in 23 days comes THE LADY FROM SHANGAI a dark film noir woven from the very same fabric of Wellesian mythos that covers THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS MR ARKADIN and any other film the director didn t manage to save from the clutches of studio bosses br br Six years after THE MALTESE FALCON with the post war craze of the film noir in full swing Welles always ahead of his time a true visionary director of tremendous artistic integrity envisioned a labyrinthine world of shadows that is already darker more sinister paranoid and serpentine than anything his contemporaries were doing at the time It s no wonder the movie was so misunderstood at its time to the point that one full hour of footage was forever left in the cutting room floor and it was once again Europe that championed it as another Welles classic br br Certain set pieces stand out The aquarium scene with its flickering light and ominous shadows and of course the Funhouse Hall of Mirrors finale that is as classic a piece of Wellesian bravura as any in CITIZEN KANE or THE TRIAL The only faults I find with the movie is Welles ill advised Irish accent and perhaps some of the erratic editing in the first act The story however unfurls in a progressively mesmerizing manner which the cuts only serve to intensify I believe the heavily chopped versions of Shangai and Ambersons attain a surreal quality for that matter br br Welles would exile himself in Europe for ten years and return in 1958 to deliver yet another stonewall classic the monumental TOUCH OF EVIL perhaps the crowning jewel of the film noir that was already in its waning days by that time Shangai was not the box office success a star vehicle for Hollywood s premiere star of the time Rita Hayworth ought to have been and Welles marriage with Hayworth ended before the movie was even released Sixty years later and one hour of footage less Shangai is still one of the best film noir pictures one is likely to discover Surely that must count for something
Pure Orson Welles genius makes this one of the greatest of movies Welles is drawn into a murder conspiracy only to be set up as the fall guy which is what he refers to with the sarcastic comment big dummy that I am Plot is so complex that I still don t know whether the victim knew that his life was about to be lost The shootout scene in the carnival hall of mirrors is one of the most amazing ever filmed That scene alone is worth the price of admission This is the only time that Rita Hayworth ever played a complex yet believable character No one but Welles would have had the nerve to cut her hair and dye it brassy blond No one should miss this picture
Despite loving Rita Hayworth finding the final few sequences of the film intriguing and being able to appreciate some of the subtler symbolic aspects of the cinematography The Lady from Shanghai didn t quite work for me I had a problem with most of the performances the script and the overall structure And in a film that s mostly people talking with each other in various situations that s quite a problem The Lady from Shanghai ended up at a very low C or a 7 for me br br The Lady from Shanghai is really all about Orson Welles character Michael O Hara O Hara sees Elsa Rosalie Bannister Rita Hayworth in Central Park on a carriage ride and hits on her Later he saves her from a mugging and she takes a shine to him O Hara is a seaman from Ireland and the globetrotting Elsa happens to own a yacht with her husband Arthur Everett Sloane a very famous and powerful California defense attorney They talk O Hara into working for them despite his initial reservations it seems to him and to the audience that Elsa is just looking for someone to have an affair with and O Hara doesn t want to get involved br br Shortly after going to work on their yacht a strange man George Grisby Glenn Anders who says he s Arthur s partner shows up at a port of call and begins stirring up trouble Eventually Grisby asks O Hara to enter into a very dubious and dangerous scheme Foolishly O Hara agrees Naturally it gets him into quite a bit of trouble and eventually a number of mysteries are revealed br br Maybe my problems with the film lie in the fact that so far I m not exactly a huge fan of Orson Welles and here he produces writes directs and consumes most of the screen time I haven t seen anywhere near the majority of Welles work yet but I ve tended to like his later films better when he became a bit more campy and performance arty I love F for Fake V√©rit√©s et mensonges 1974 for example and I even kind of like his performance in Casino Royale 1967 when he bizarrely insisted on being allowed to do magic tricks at a baccarat table but Citizen Kane 1941 never did much for me despite giving it 3 or 4 chances over the years including about one year ago my rating was a low 7 the same as my current score for The Lady from Shanghai br br Welles performance and the dialogue he s written for himself come across as affected and pretentious to me He s a bit of a motormouth a bit of a boor and a bit monotone he tends to sound like he s reading His performance reminded me of what I ve seen of Welles version of Moby Dick listed on IMDb as 1999 but completed in 1971 it can also be seen in Orson Welles The One Man Band 1995 where he seems to be just reading to the camera and believing that he s inherently sublimely dramatic I m also someone who almost never complains about accents but somehow Welles manages to make his Irish accent sound affected and pretentious to me too br br As for the other performances I can only say I thought Hayworth did an excellent job Of course she s gorgeous which doesn t hurt Plenty of eye candy here Like Welles Sloane also seemed a bit affected and pretentious to me I never quite bought his character his handicap and so on and Anders is simply bizarre where bizarre doesn t seem to fit Welles often shoots him in close up and Anders almost always has some over exaggerated manic expression on his sweaty face br br Structurally The Lady from Shanghai is very uneven The first 50 minutes or so are extremely bland and soap operatic although the soap opera ministrations tend to be approached from a tortuous oblique Once Grisby introduces his scheme things pick up a bit and mostly improve as we near the end But by the time The Lady from Shanghai becomes a crime mystery film it s too little too late and it quickly turns into a courtroom drama before the sudden thrilling ending that comes almost out of nowhere and is over far too quickly for its relative excellence br br The ending is more action oriented less dialogue heavy more varied and exotic in settings and at times fairly abstract Welles handles that combination of material skillfully as a director If The Lady from Shanghai would have been a largely a combination of the crime mystery stuff and the arty ending it could have easily been at least a 9 The final scenes are easily 10s as Welles shifts from a Hitchcockian suspense scene in a San Francisco Chinese opera house to another suspense scene in a Chinese amusement park The funhouse climax uses cinematography that was experimental for its time It s well integrated with the script as it allows a complex resolution and fuels a lot of symbolism br br The cinematography throughout is interesting even if it usually can t make up for the problems in the foreground Welles blocks scenes with skill There are lots of attractively filmed settings from Central Park to Acapulco to various San Francisco locations Welles effectively creates symbolic backdrops for his action from the emphasized heights and precipitous drops of Acapulco to the maze like Caribbean streets the beautifully framed and silhouetted shots of the San Francisco Aquarium and so on The romance material for which the Aquarium serves as one backdrop is interestingly tempered with a kind of unease throughout the film but on the other hand that makes the romance never quite work as romance br br Surely serious Welles fans will appreciate The Lady from Shanghai much more than I did and of course it s worth a watch if you love Rita Hayworth The Lady from Shanghai isn t exactly a terrible film in my view but it s dangerously close to not passing Proceed with caution
It s very hard to say just what was going on with The Lady from Shanghai and what the film could have been without studio interference Orson Welles prime interest in film at this point was to raise money for his theater indeed funding his own projects is what drove him to seek out acting jobs He made Lady from Shanghai for his soon to be ex wife Rita Hayworth Harry Cohn was fearful for Rita s image and held back the release of this movie for one year br br The plot concerns an Irish sailor Michael O Hara who falls in love with Else Hayworth stunning with short blond hair Her husband is a well known criminal attorney Arthur Bannister Everett Sloane who is as crippled on the inside as he is out He hires O Hara to work on his yacht and there O Hara is drawn deeper and deeper into a web of murder and deceit br br The Lady from Shanghai moves at a snail s pace though I agree with one of the posters that films today are criticized for taking time to build a plot Still this movie drags The scene in the fun house is fantastic Welles wanted it without music though and I believe the studio cut it down It s a shame The photography throughout is stunning atmospheric bold and very stylish br br Welles was an excellent actor handsome in his youth charismatic and possessing a magnificent voice and technique but in many films it s almost as if he doesn t trust himself or doesn t take the time to develop a character Instead he relies on externals such as accents and fake noses One of the only times he didn t do this was Tomorrow is Forever where the director gets an excellent deeply felt performance out of him Contrast that with Compulsion where he shows he is a master of pure technical acting as he phones in his performance Here Welles is doing quadruple duty as director star co writer and narrator Sporting a completely unnecessary accent and looking intense was a fast way to a characterization Nevertheless he is always compelling br br The supporting players are excellent including Sloan and Glenn Anders Hayworth gorgeous and soft voiced her singing was again dubbed by Anita Ellis is as usual a complete goddess and one of the great screen presences What a sad life for such a vibrant beauty br br Any film that Orson Welles directed is worth seeing and The Lady from Shanghai is no exception But this one leaves the viewer frustrated as does The Magnificent Ambersons as does any work that Welles did within the studio system He was a great artist who should have been given a freer reign he wasn t He was a strange dichotomy he needed more freedom but as is evidenced by some of his later work he needed the structure of the studio Alas he couldn t have both
The Lady From Shanghai is weird even by the standards of its eminent director Orson Welles whose last Hollywood film this was for many a moon It s a kind of post modern film noir made during the period when more conventional films of this type were quite popular and it concerns a happy go lucky Irish sailor played by Welles who falls in with a mysterious lady Rita Hayworth who was married to Welles at the time and her crippled and probably impotent husband played with a brainy malevolent gusto by Everett Sloan A long sea voyage follows with Welles in tow as bodyguard and the plot thickens when Sloan s law partner Glenn Anders turns up and starts making trouble by giving odd speeches about suicide and other morbid topics that suggest that the man is on the verge of mental breakdown A murder plot ensues and all sorts of calamities follow for Welles and his employers and at this point the story fuzzy and told at a leisurely pace thus far goes off the deep end and the last part of the film consists of brilliant directorial set pieces that seem to have been thrown in to give the movie some of the drive and urgency its story does not by itself possess and the result is a very watchable and often pleasing at all times incomprehensible mess br br It s hard to know what Welles was trying to do with this film aside from maybe resurrect his career in Hollywood by making a vehicle for his wife But self destruction intervenes as it often does with Welles and Miss Hayworth has never looked less fetching That she is also cast as a femme fatale seems peculiar as aside from her beauty her most appealing trait as a screen personality was lovableness a quality she does not possess in this picture The director himself is strangely unappealing and hammy at O Hara the presumably easygoing sailor since Welles for all his many gifts was not known as an easy man to work with This is a role that twenty or thirty years later Sean Connery or Robert Shaw might have been able to breath life into Welles does not The most interesting performance in the movie is Glenn Anders as Grisby Sloan s loony treacherous law partner Anders works wonders with the part and is photographed to look bizarre while his scenes end on odd sour notes and are often choppily edited but for all this he manages to make Grisby s derangement palpable and disturbing and anticipates in a genteel way the more flamboyant Method actors of the fifties such as Timothy Carey br br There is a question that nags me about this film what was Welles trying to say He was a highly talented and intelligent man and tended to make statements in his movies which whether one agrees with his world view or not were brilliantly put forth I think I have an answer or a partial one Welles was summing up his movie career He had reached the end of his rope in the Hollywood studio system he despised and he knew it The Lady From Shanghai isn t exactly a nose thumbing at the studio moguls of the day but I suspect that it is in its portrait of amoral rival big shot lawyers read producers expressing Welles opinion of the power brokers of Hollywood That he presented himself as a rootless sailor is telling Welles himself was certainly an inveterate traveler and he rarely lived in one place for long He was hired by a studio to provide it with a big prestigious film Citizen Kane which caused a firestorm of controversy from which he never fully recovered This may be the issue that dares not speak its name in this film which is to say Welles personal failure in not getting over the shock of his newness in the movie colony and his inability to deliver the goods as promised The mere fact of him turning up in Hollywood like his mere presence in the film could not forestall disasters well beyond his control That he presented himself in the movie as an amiable naive outsider shows a lack of self knowledge on Welles part He was much more of an inside player than he let on and I imagine that he despised his knowledge of the worldlier aspects of life and himself for knowing so much
This 1947 film stars and was directed and written by Orson Welles with a funky Irish accent and also stars the gorgeous Rita Hayworth with less appealing short blonde hair So I ve hung out with Orson before in Touch of Evil and Citizen Kane and the Third Man etc but this was my first Rita Hayworth interaction Our first meeting went well she does a superb job playing the frightened cagey Elsa married to a crippled millionaire lawyer Mike Welles and Elsa fall for each other He wants to run away with her she doesn t know if she can live without the things money can buy Elsa her husband and his partner bicker and bite just like the sharks Mike describes attacking each other and his foretelling proves just too true Several twists and turns follow in this murder mystery as we come to the climax in the fun house Think the ending shootout in The Man with the Golden Gun which borrowed heavily from this scene I wasn t sure who the murderer was until the end br br This movie is like shrimp in garlic and lemon The dish centers on the sea it is subtle sour and pungent all to great effect These might not be the best fresh shrimp but good quality frozen shrimp from Costco The flavorful sauce adds to the naturalness of the pink shrimp as you fill up on a healthy but filling alternative to more mundane common fare 7 10 http blog myspace com locoformovies
What can I say it s a damn good movie See it if you still haven t Great camera works and lighting techniques Awesome just awesome Orson Welles is incredible The Lady From Shanghai can certainly take the place of Citizen Kane
Surreal film noir released soon after the real genre defining classics The Maltese Falcon Double Indemnity and The Postman Always Rings Twice Welles films shouldn t be evaluated against others He was playing by different rules In fact he was playing This starts where other femme fatale films leave off so the vaguely logical but interesting whodunit is embellished with a display of Wellesian scenes typical rapid fire style dialog lots of hard boiled philosophy and unusual acting good Hayworth presumably intentionally one dimensional To Welles genre may have meant formula but he seemed to like using mysteries as backgrounds for his entertainments
Any film in the early days of Orson Welles is a triumph all the way to The third Man with Joseph Cotton He is also wonderful in a Touch Of Evil Please see them all He tends to get pompous and self serving in films like F is for Fake really stupid waste of film Don t waste your time watching it it is really ignorant Orson Welles is a film icon and anyone studying film should see everything he has filmed All his leading ladies are tremendous but in the end Welles became a fat drunk like his character in A Touch Of Evil For some reason Orson Welles had a way with women I see how he could be considered attractive in his youth not like Gary Cooper or Joseph Cotton or Cary Grant John Wayne I could go on and on but I digress and because I am a woman I can see the attraction to him He Orson Welles is one of the last true film makers and unless you count the film makers of today Tarantino Scorscese Spike Lee most of the film makers just don t measure up to the film makers of the Forties I know there are many more great film makers of today but in such a short amount of time I can t name them all No Offense to any of the great film makers of this millennium August 21 2006 Please remind me of some current up and coming film makers I don t want to be stuck in the past I love some of the films out now but rarely are there any that I would put on a 100 best list Hustle and Flow was great so was Fargo and Oh Brother where art thou from a line in Sullivan s travels another fine film from the forties Can anyone give me a best list for the 90 s and on up to 2006 I would like to know who to watch Thank you Also Props to this website Where else can you plug a film or boo it i love the ranting and raving from regular folks like me who can say what I want and I promise not to spoil any film for someone who hasn t seen it yet
Orson Welles manages to knock me on my ass with every picture of his I see Lady of Shanghai is on the same level as his other masterpieces The Magnificent Ambersons Touch of Evil The Trial and Chimes at Midnight The plot can tend to be confusing sometimes and sometimes it seems to be moving maybe a tiny bit too fast about an hour of it was edited out when test screenings went poorly It doesn t matter however You can t watch Welles films and manage to concentrate too much on the plot His direction defines what great direction is Almost any scene from this film can hold up with any other scene he directed Check out the courtroom scene Usually they are such stock scenes that I can t stand them Case in point try to sit through Welles own speech near the end of Compulsion In Lady from Shanghai just pay attention to the level of detail in that courtroom scene Watch that juror who is always sneezing and interrupting the proceedings Or just take a look at the lighting in that scene I know it is just a simple Venetian blind and that it was used constantly in film noirs and crime films of the era but Welles gives it a beauty all its own The dialogue is also remarkable Welles had the skill a skill that no one else seemed to have to make a crime film containing examples of the grandest poetry Whether he was speaking Shakespeare or spitting out hard boiled lines it had the power to stir the soul 10 10
This could be well have been THE definitive film noir of all time had not the Columbia Studios cut so much of Orson Welles s original What we are left with is a flawed yet brilliant film that showcases the overwhelming talent of Welles as an actor director and Rita Hayworth as a serious dramatic talent br br The Lady From Shanghai is film noir at it s most sizzling and confusing Welles with an uneven accent portrays Michael O Hara a journeyman Irishman who after a fateful encounter with the seductive dangerous Elsa Bannister Hayworth in a GREAT performance finds himself virtually coerced into accepting a job as a crewman on her and her crippled husband s Everett Sloane yacht Elsa or Rosalie as Michael likes to call her plays the innocent helpless doll very well ensnaring O Hara in her web As the lovers conduct a not so secret affair at sea Arthur Bannister s partner in his law firm George Grisby Glenn Anders comes aboard He is a weird untrustworthy figure who offers Michael a unique proposal He will get 5000 to assist Grisby in the faking of Grisby s death so it looks murder The plan is for Michael to get off a technicality and run off into the sun with Elsa But things do not go to plan br br Hayworth delivers us one of the best femme fatales of all time in a very ambiguous portrayal At times she seems genuinely vulnerable and child like at others brutal world weary and hard Always she is brilliantly beautiful whether he situation calls for her to be dripping wet in a swimsuit or dressed in black brandishing a gun Hayworth is beautifully photographed here and she is a far cry from her famous Gilda role Her then husband Orson Welles cut off her trademark auburn locks for a dyed blonde crop angering Columbia boss Harry Cohn It was a terrific marketing ploy and he change suits her changed attitude wonderfully She is not the sympathetic femme fatale that Gilda is here instead she is a predatory black hearted dame who sees murder as a very useful option br br The Welles and Hayworth pairing came at a time when the couple were having extreme difficulties in their marriage They would divorce after the film was made so this is also a curiosity for providing some view into the complicated relationship They are hateful not romantic lovers in this so it s hard to gauge whether or not they had real chemistry on screen Certainly every encounter is potent and filled with raw sexuality with Welles as the fall guy he even admits it himself in the film and Rita as the double crossing babe br br Welles character is the typical noir drifter with not much sense As Welles voice over proves to use O Hara indeed does not use his brain very much expect to be thinking of her Elsa Welles usually played intelligent charismatic fellows so his turn here as the dim witted Michael is unusual and very interesting Indeed Welles was an actor of fine talent and he pulls off it well br br Everett Sloane is suitably slimy as Hayworth s crippled husband One wonders why he hires Michael It is obvious that his wife is interested in him romantically so why does he invite a threat on board One interpretation could be that Michael provides the service to his wife that Bannister cannot in his crippled state There is definitely something to that theory with a lot of implications toward Elsa s behaviour before she met her husband was she some sort of prostitute and Grisby s knowledge of Bannister s most intimate secrets being hinted at in several scenes br br This is a jumbled convoluted film with a plot that is ultimately flawed We are more interested in the love triangle than the murder plot as with most noirs Welles provides us with many of his usual brilliant cinematic touches including the justifiably famous hall of mirrors climax It s a terrific scene one ending that can almost obliterate the faults earlier on in the movie and lift it into greatness This fun house scene is visually stunning with a Dali like feel to the painted sets apparently Orson painted them himself Subtle visual imagery utilized throughout the film by Welles enhances the plot and makes this a thought provoking experience br br The dialogue is scorching and confusing delivered superbly by Rita s alternately breathy low voice and helpless high pitched little girl voice Hayworth proves her acting capabilities in this one and proves that SHE is the ultimate femme fatale of noir It s a pity only a slight one as Rita was a brilliant dancer that she did so many delightful yet frothy and often forgettable musicals for Columbia in the 40 s instead of darkly themed noir like this She was a brilliant actress when given the chance to show off her talent br br 9 10

particularly in regard to his movie The Lady From Shanghai According to Ms Pacios the movie along with related archival materials has many of the same ritualistic elements associated with Short s murder She raises the question Could Welles have been the killer Interesting theories and with the spate of books now out on The Black Dahlia much more may come to light Fritz Lang s brutal film noir The Big Heat 1953 was a roman a clef telling of the Dahlia killing in The City Of Nets that was L A but it s the Orson opus that the Dahlia had a hands on connection to In reality it was Bugsy Siegel and the Hollywood mob wars of the 1940 s that did the Dahlia in but that doesn t negate much of what Pacios wrote Almost all of Hollywood intersected with Elizabeth The Black Dahlia Short and her tale aura legacy curse is encoded in a number of Golden Age films br br The Black Dahlia was always on the peripheral edges of Shanghai even before it started filming Barbara Payton on Franchot Tone It was when he was thinking about making The Lady From Shanghai before he lost the option to Orson Welles Franchot said he d been in a bad state over that deal when he ran into the Dahlia in the Formosa Cafe across from the Goldwyn studios The floor above the Formosa Cafe was Bugsy Siegel s office and The Dahlia one of his on again off again working girls br br It gets deeper and darker After the 1951 brawl over Barbara Payton between Tom Neal and Franchot Tone that sent Franchot to the hospital with a concussion and never talking the same way again Barbara said she married Tone just to spite Neal Tom Detour Neal also knew The Dahlia who didn t and became obsessed From L A Despair by John Gilmore The January 1947 slaying of the young beautiful would be actress Elizabeth Short known as The Black Dahlia was one of the most grisly murders in the annals of modern crime A project called Who Killed The Black Dahlia was being kicked off by actor Tom Neal a hell raiser from WW II movies Potential producer Gene Harris Someone will have to come up with a more imaginative business proposition than what has been presented by Tom Neal and his cohorts Not long after It would be very clear one beautiful day to come when Tom would sneak up on his pretty new Palm Springs wife as she lay on their sofa and shoot a 45 bullet through her head Barbara Payton and Norma Jean Dougherty later Marilyn Monroe knew the Dahlia and their stories are well known It seems all who crossed the path of the Dahlia like the proverbial black cat entered a Twilight Zone darkness and or had an incredible string of bad luck afterward Tone Neal Welles are only a few and this includes a butchered film called The Lady From Shanghai br br Lady From Shanghai took two years to be released thanks to extensive re editing and all because Columbia president Harry Cohn couldn t understand the story It s dark noir to be sure one of the darkest in fact It s also a wicked satire on life in the new Atomic Age br br Nicolas Christopher br br Shanghai pushes forth an insistent subtext of nuclear apocalypse and contains the definitive noir statement concerning the atomic bomb and the American city The film s principal murder victim and there are many a psychotic and double dealing lawyer manically foresees Armageddon at every turn claiming he can feel it He announces that he plans to escape to a remote Pacific island a particularly acid joke on Welles part since this was the very year the U S began testing atomic bombs at just such a place the Bikini Atoll relocating all the inhabitants and destroying the ecosystem By the time of Bikini the erotic identification of Hayworth with the Bomb appears to have been institutionalized with the blessing of the military brass the first bomb dropped in the Pacific testing ground in named Gilda and has Hayworth s image in provocative dress painted directly on its casing br br Its ironic that Orson Welles broad interpretation of an Irishman is considered a detriment to the film by many Welles is giving a clue to viewers that Michael O Hara is only the storyteller not part of the story even though it revolves around him O Hara contradicts the shark motif throughout the film Sharks on a feeding frenzy won t stop until there s nothing left Michael O Hara lives to tell the tale Elsa Bannister causes a feeding frenzy during O Hara s trial and her netted chapeau suggests she s caged in so as not to devour the human spectators to a Roman Coleseum The spectators are on a feeding frenzy of their own gossiping and carrying on about Elsa a human aquarium correlating to the San Francisco marine museum sequence That s the human condition except for Michael O Hara And yet he ll be spending his life trying to forget his past Elsa or die trying Elsa is part of Michael and the tale eats its own tail in the end and the viewer is cautioned to stay out of trouble
The first mystery is to guess what Welles original film was like That makes this a real adventure to see an incomplete skeleton and using cinematic forensics imagine the beautiful woman it once supported br br If you do you will both see and experience perhaps one of the best film mysteries ever As mysteries go the narrative is rather ordinary a simple diversion one jealous husband as red herring br br What s rather miraculous is Welles placement of the story in an artificial eye seeing a dark dark multifaceted world The first real noir but even darker It s not an obviously twisted world unless you think about the camera What we can see firsthand is someone creating a vocabulary that would later become common br br For all the celebration Kane was a success because of the great drama and story The camera s eye was shocking but experimental Welles would go from there to explore the mystery narrative and the self reference of Shakespeare with this eye Othello and MacBeth are both begun in this period and I consider them part of a single vision with this br br The noir feel here hinges on the notion that people are not in charge of their lives even a little they are manipulated by random factors in the environment So in telling this story Welles has to make the environment into a character Several characters as suspects in the mystery br br Thus we have the famous lighting blocking and angles we know and have since seen countless times And we have the deliberately closed sets the park yacht picnic area aquarium dock courtroom Chinese theater and funhouse I am certain that what was cut by the barbarians was lots and lots of external narrative dealing not with character but with these strange environments br br My own solution to the mystery is that the funhouse did it among the other character environments introduced as suspects In other words the manipulation of Black Irish who we know from notes and one scene typing at the union hall was an aspiring novelist was neither a force of human conspiracy the park or the civilized version the courtroom nor of nature the picnic or the civilized version the aquarium br br Instead it was a matter of deliberate caprice by the gods for amusement This is of course a self reference to what Welles is doing putting these people including himself through hell for our own caprice a matter underscored by the Peking Opera set with Welles doped up And of course leading to the funhouse where the environment directly tinkers with perception br br More about the self reference surely there is conscious comment on his relationship with his soon to be exwife But I believe there is strong subconscious comment on his own taunting the environment in which he worked the studio environment Surely Welles was as much screwed with and in much the same way as his character And that screwing took the form of the murder of this film leaving the rotting corpse mentioned at the beginning of this comment br br That poor Rita comes from China ties up the whole thing the Chinese theater the expected rape from above the loss of the woman The investment in environment beyond all
At the point in time that The Lady from Shanghai was being made the marriage of Orson Welles and Rita Hayworth was disintegrating The film was as much an effort by Welles to rekindle the old flames as it was to make a classic noir Not received well at the time The Lady from Shanghai has gotten more and more critical acclaim as years pass Gotten better with age so to speak br br Welles is Irish seaman Michael O Hara who on a fateful night rescues the beautiful Rita Hayworth from three muggers in Central Park Sparks do fly but then comes the rub turns out the lady is married to crippled but brilliant criminal attorney Everett Sloane Nevertheless Sloane takes an apparent liking to Welles and hires him to skipper his yacht br br So far this film is starting to sound a lot like Gilda If Orson had seen Gilda and was not at this point thinking with his male member he would have skedaddled back to the seaman s hiring hall in Lower Manhattan Instead he gets himself involved in a lovely web or intrigue and finds himself pegged for two murders and Sloane as his eminent counsel br br Welles for whatever reason decided that his wife would be a blond in this film Supposedly Harry Cohn hit the roof as Rita was internationally known for her coppery red hair This may have soured him on the picture as he joined the legion of studio bosses who saw Welles s vision of independent film making a threat to their power br br Stage actor Glenn Anders plays Sloane s partner Grisby who is one slimy dude he winds up a corpse The other corpse to be here is Ted DeCorsia a bottom feeding private detective who tries to go in business for himself br br It s a good noir thriller showing Rita at her glamorous best even if she was a blond here The final shoot out in the hall of mirrors is beautifully staged but I wouldn t recommend seeing it if one is on any controlled substance
Made in 1946 and released in 1948 The Lady and Shanghai was one of the big films made by Welles after returning from relative exile for making Citizen Kane Dark brooding and expressing some early Cold War paranoia this film stands tall as a Film Noir crime film The cinematography of this film is filled with Welles characteristic quirks of odd angles quick cuts long pans and sinister lighting The use of ambient street music is a precursor to the incredible long opening shot in Touch of Evil and the mysterious Chinese characters and the sequences in Chinatown can only be considered as the inspiration in many ways to Roman Polanski s Chinatown Unfortunately it is Welles obsession with technical filmmaking that hurts this film in its entirety The plot of this story is often lost behind a sometimes incomprehensible clutter of film techniques br br However despite this criticism the story combined with wonderful performances by Welles Hayworth and especially Glenn Anders Laughter make this film a joy to watch Orson Welles pulls off not only the Irish brogue but the torn identities as the honest but dangerous sailor Rita Hayworth who was married to Welles at the time breaks with her usual roles as a sex goddess and takes on a role of real depth and contradictions Finally Glenn Anders strange and bizarre portrayal or Elsa s husbands law partner is nothing short of classic
As I watched one of Orson Welles last contributions to Hollywood as a filmmaker I knew I was watching a great movie unfold though at times I did not know why The story in The Lady from Shanghai has the prime elements of a film noir average Joe lead femme fatale conspicuous supporting characters and a comprehensible if somewhat convoluted plot structure It is an entertaining ride and it s filled to the brim with Welles unique gifts as a director but there are scenes that tend to just not work or don t feel complete in what was Welles full vision the latter is unfortunately too true executive producer Harry Cohn and the Columbia execs are to blame for that br br Welles co stars with his then wife the profoundly gorgeous Rita Hayworth as Mike O Hara an Irish worker who can and does get angry at the right people Hayworth is Mrs Bannister married to Mr Bannister Everett Sloane who played Mr Bernstein in Citizen Kane who is accompanied by a friend Mr Grisby Glenn Anders who has great control in his eyes They want to go sailing on their yacht and take O Hara along for the ride and at first he s reluctant but agrees since he s falling for the married Mrs As their journey unfolds O Hara finds that Bannister and Grisby are not pleasant to be around and more so with Grisby who at first seems out of his gourd Yet as the plot unfolds O Hara is drawn into a scam that Grisby is planning for insurance money with results that I dare not reveal although they have been discussed over and over by others br br Whatever liabilities pop up here and there in the mystery part of the story and those few noticeable moments where shots were studio dictated the performances and the look of the film are what remains striking after over fifty five years Though he doesn t have the terrific Greg Tolland Kane s DP at his side dependable Charles Lawton Jr assists Welles in creating an atmosphere that is both elegant and stark covered in shadows deep focus low angles the works A particular accomplishment is the fun house mirror scene which is merely a highlight among others Welles himself is always dependable as an actor even if his accent isn t anything special and Hayworth herself makes a scene a little more lush despite her path in the story br br The Lady from Shanghai is worth checking out especially for Welles Hayworth or film noir buffs fans of the Coen brothers might find this fascinating as well It may just take a little while repeat viewings as was for Touch of Evil for the underlying motives in the plot to sink in
Orson Welles The Lady From Shanghai does not have the brilliant screenplay of Citizen Kane e g but Charles Lawton Jr s cinematography the unforgettable set pieces such as the scene in the aquarium the seagoing scene featuring a stunning blonde tressed Rita Hayworth singing Please Don t Love Me and the truly amazing Hall of Mirrors climax and the wonderful cast Everett Sloane in his greatest performance Welles in a beautifully under played role the afore mentioned Miss Hayworth Welles wife at the time at her most gorgeous make for a very memorable filmgoing experience The bizarre murder mystery plot is fun and compelling not inscrutable at all The viewer is surprised by the twists and turns and Welles closing line is an unheralded classic The Lady From Shanghai gets four stars from this impartial arbiter
One can only imagine the film Mr Welles might have finished without the interference of the studio This film is a flawed Welles but worth every minute of it because one can see the greatness of perhaps America s best motion picture director of all times br br We can see the toll it took on Orson Welles the filming of this movie The story has a lot of holes in it perhaps because of the demands of the studio executives that didn t trust the director br br It is curious by reading some of the opinions submitted to IMDB that compare Orson Welles with the Coen brothers Roman Polanski even Woody Allen when it should be all of those directors that must be regarded as followers of the great master himself No one was more original and creative in the history of American cinema than Mr Welles Lucky are we to still have his legacy either in retrospective looks such as the one the Film Forum in New York just ended or his films either on tape or DVD form br br Rita Hayworth was never more lovingly photographed than here If she was a beauty with her red hair as a blonde she is just too stunning for words Everett Sloan and Glenn Anders made an excellent contribution to the movie br br The only thing that might have made this film another masterpiece to be added to Orson Welles body of work was his own appearance in it Had he concentrated in the directing and had another actor interpret Michael O Hara a different film might have been achieved altogether Orson Welles has to be credited for being perhaps a pioneer in taking the camera away from the studio lot into the street The visuals in this film are so amazing that we leave the theater after seeing this movie truly impressed for the work the vision and the talent he gave us
After CITIZEN KANE in 1941 Hollywood executives turned their cob webbed backs on the great Orson Welles With the exception of KANE Welles lost all creative control on MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS JOURNEY INTO FEAR and many other films to come Welles was an innovative and creative genius the most unconventional of filmmakers when Hollywood was in need of a few more THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI is yet another example of the misunderstood view of Welles films at the time a movie that seems a bit choppy and non fluent It has a conventional 1940 s premise told in a most unconventional way and I am sure some scenes ended up on the cutting room floor It is now legend that Columbia mogul Harry Cohn stood up during its initial screening and asked what it was about In hindsight many old grumps that ran the studios back then had not one clue as to the cinematic techniques and master story telling of Orson Welles and THE LADY FROM SHANGHAI is only nearly great because of their intrusion br br Beside being arguably the greatest director of all time Welles was also quite a performer as an actor At 25 we all know what he did as Charles Foster Kane perhaps the most famous character in film history Here he inhabits a rare character of dim wit and not much intelligence something unfamiliar to those familiar with Welles other great work Instead of a slick wise tongue he speaks with a rough Irish twang Rita Hayworth his unhappily married wife at the time plays an unhappily married wife of a lawyer who puts Welles in a spell and is able to draw him into a job that will take him to the limits of deception and disillusionment He is a large lug who may have even murdered a man but the real mystery lies in the relationship between Hayworth with stunning blonde hair and crippled hubby Everett Sloane Mr Bernstein from CITIZEN KANE A creepy partner of Sloane s is along for the sail around the country to set off a number of peculiar events that has Welles Michael O Hara head spinning Welles narrates the picture as O Hara but things are still unclear throughout See for yourself and realize that it takes at least 2 viewings to fully know exactly what s up br br An uncharacteristically strange courtroom sequence centers around O Hara with Sloane defending him It is an oddly comedic scene with some quirky courtroom methods including Sloane cross examining himself I didn t really laugh here because the film stalls at this point after a first portion that never gets to take off anyway Up to this point the cinematography is great some scenes are shot with craft and skill aquarium love scene but there is no distinct line drawing the elements and us the audience in Reportedly the court scene was re shot against Welles requests 10 closeups of Hayworth were ordered and a makeshift song sung by the starlet was thrown in at Cohn s insistence A gaudy score infuriated Welles who once again was left out of the editing process Thank Welles himself for saving the film entirely with a tour de force ending that will always be treasured The so called Hall of Mirrors scene brings buffs back time and time again rightfully so br br It must be seen to be believed and it does a good job of wrapping up some confusing ideas presented The crash of the mirrors represents O Hara s disillusionment and the crazy house itself is a masterpiece of art and set decoration It seems more like a state of mind than an actual place and is indeed crazy twisted and turned like a Dali painting This is a great ending to a flawed picture that if left alone would probably have made the AFI s Top 100 Then again 3 or 4 more of Orson Welles films may have made all collective best of lists if he had been left alone to create his own magic br br NOTE Look for the Mercury Players that are so prominent in Welles pictures They pop up all over RATING 8 of 10
Of all the film noirs of the 1940s and 1950s this has to rank as one of the strangest and most fun to watch I say that because of the four main actors Orson Welles Rita Hayworth Everett Sloane and Glenn Anders br br The first two names are familiar to everyone but it was the last two that made this movie so entertaining to me especially Anders His character George Grisby is one of the strangest people I ve ever seen on film His voice and some of the things he said have to be heard to be believed Slaone isn t far behind in the strange category Hayworth is not as glamorous with short blonde hair but still is Hayworth which means a lot to ogle if you are a guy Welles is as fascinating as always One tip if you have the DVD turn on the English subtitles His character in this movie is an Irishman and you need the subtitles to understand everything he says br br Welles also directed the film which means you have great camera angles and wonderful facial closeups You also have a unique ending visually with a shootout in a house of mirrors Great stuff As bizarre as this film is I still thought the buffoon like carnival atmosphere at the trial near the end was too much and took away from the seriousness of the scene Other than that no complaints br br This is great entertainment which is the name of the game
After all you do not go to an Orson Welles movie to see a nice simple little plot and a burnishing of the image of a happy ever after star br br You go to see theatrically heightened characters locked in conflict against colorful and unusual settings lighted and scored imaginatively photographed bravely and the whole thing peppered with unexpected details of surprise that a wiser and duller director would either avoid or not think of in the first place br br As usual as well as directing Welles wrote the script and he also played the hero a young Irish seaman who had knocked about the world and seen its evil but still retained his clear eyed trust in the goodness of others Unfortunately for him he reposed this trust in Rita Hayworth whose cool good looks concealed a gloomy past and murderous inclinations for the future She was married without love to an impotent crippled advocate acted like a malevolent lizard by the brilliant Everett Sloane br br There is a youthful romanticism underlying it all and this quality came into exuberant play in The Lady from Shanghai Before the inevitable happened Welles escaped to a final triangular showdown in a hall of mirrors which has become one of the classic scenes of the post war cinema br br Welles did not miss a chance throughout the whole film to counterpoint the words and actions with visual detail which enriched the texture and heightened the atmosphere His camera seemed almost to caress Rita Hayworth as the sun played with her hair and her long limbs while she playfully teased the young seaman into her web
These are excerpts from a nine page Memo to Mr Cohn from Mr Welles written after Orson had seen studio mogul Harry Cohn s edited version of the picture he took an hour out br br The preview title music was written by a first rate composer George Antheil Although not written for our picture at all this temporary title music had an atmosphere of darkness and menace combined with something lush and romantic which made it acceptable The only musical idea which seems to have occurred to this present composer Heinz Roemheld is the rather weary one of using a popular song the theme in as many arrangements as possible Throughout we have musical references to Please Don t Kiss Me for almost every bridge and also for a great deal of the background material The tune is pleasing it may do very well on the Hit Parade but Lady from Shanghai is not a musical comedy Mr Roemheld is an ardent devotee of an old fashioned type of scoring now referred to in our business as Disney In other words if somebody falls down he makes a falling down sound in the orchestra etc etc If the lab had scratched initials and phone numbers all over the negative I couldn t be unhappier about the results Just before I left to go abroad I asked Vi Viola Lawrence the editor to make a cut which would involve dropping the near accident with the taxi cab and also quite a bit of dialogue I am convinced that this would have been an excellent cut saving much needed footage in the slow opening sequence this was not done accounting for the main weaknesses of the film s opening reel There is nothing in the fact of Rita s diving to warrant a big orchestral crescendo What does matter is Rita s beauty the evil overtones suggested by Grigsby s character and Michael s bewilderment Any or all of these items might have inspired the music Instead the dive is treated as though it were a major climax or some antic moment in a Silly Symphony a pratfall by Pluto the Pup or a wild jump into space by Donald Duck There is no sound atmosphere on the boat A little wind and water is sorely missed There s no point in photographing a scene on a real boat if you make it sound as though it all happened in front of a process screen At the start of the picnic sequence in the temporary score we used a very curious sexy Latin American strain This has been replaced with a corny dramatic sequel bad stock stuff This sort of music destroys that quality of strangeness which is exactly what might have saved Lady from Shanghai from being just another whodunit There is a big musical outburst after Grigsby s line I want you to kill him This is absurd The Hawaiian guitar music which comes out of the radio was supposed to be corny enough to make a certain satirical point As it stands now it s on about the same level as the rest of the scoring Nobody in the audience could possibly suspect that we re kidding The aquarium scene needs more echo Please Don t Kiss Me is in again A bad dubbing job and poor scoring has destroyed the character of Michael s run down the pier From the gunshot through to the phone call a careful pattern of voices had been built up with the expenditure of much time and effort For some reason this has all been junked in favor of a vague hullabaloo As a result the whole sequence seems dull The audience should feel at this point along with Michael that maybe they are going crazy The new dubbing job can only make them feel that maybe they re going to sleep The gun battle with the breaking mirrors must not be backed with music The closing music again makes reference to Please Don t Kiss Me This finale is obvious to the point of vulgarity and does incalculable injury to the finish of the picture br br All of these edits from Orson were ignored
I was very impressed with this small independently made picture The story about a pair of social outcasts who meet become friends and provide each other with a support system both seemed to lack as children is at times hilarious at times sad but always provocative Music mostly by underground bands was used to great effect as was the experimentation with camera angles filters and slow or fast motion techniques The performances the leads are played by the writers and directors of the film are some of the best I ve seen in the last couple of years If you ever felt like a square peg being forced into a round slot I really believe you ll appreciate By Hook or By Crook
people claim its edited funny but they had to cut it down substantially in post production i have harry as a professor right now at ucsd and honestly its one of the best classes I ve had its rather funny to here about what happened in making the film cause harry is so animated i originally watched joy of life for another class where harry did a voice over in the film and started watching this film after i started the class Harry originally did some performance work and is really genuine about creating moments that move you especially when you have to re edit things until you hit on that moment but its something you see in this film
By Hook or By Crook is a tremendously innovative film from a pair of immensely smart and talented filmmakers Harry Dodge and Silas Howard They manage to tell an original story in a distinctive cinematic style and it s beautifully shot by Ann T Rosetti and wonderfully written truly poetic br br The lead characters are true heroes and serve as a rare kind of role model inspiration for butch dykes and trannies everywhere This film has so much energy so much poignant passion and scruffy San Francisco heart to it I can t recommend it highly enough br br The best butch buddy movie of all time
What is so taboo about love People seem to have major problems with the transgenered br br The title of this movie didn t catch my eye It was a grainy shot about 4 minutes into the movie is what made me stop channel surfing I could not believe how freaking amazing this film was It touches on so many levels of human emotion that it did not once fail to move me in some way It is by far one of the best independent films I have ever seen I did not view these characters as either gender just human I would recommend it to anyone who loves movies Especially independent films Praise to all fearless filmmakers
A great and truly independent film that hit most of my emotions and carried me into another world Isn t this why we go to the movies I was especially impressed with the editing and the music the combination of which was very transportive
This low budget digital video film has strengths in the right places writing and acting In addition the digital photography is the best of the lot so far In low light conditions the characteristic video umber tone prevails but surprising it rivals film stock for brightness clarity and saturation in brightly lit situations This is grass roots film making at its best with snappy dialogue carrying a Midnight Cowboy kind of story about grifters doing whatever it takes to survive in urban San Francisco
I loved this movie from the opening sequence right through to the end I found the director actor s style of directly addressing me the audience very engaging br br What I found most exciting and refreshing about this movie was its ignoring and thus challenging of gender and class stereotypes The idiosyncrasies of the characters are portrayed as strengths and the absence of judgment and the characters acceptance of themselves and each other enabled me to embrace them and allow myself to be drawn into their world Without preaching and with intelligence and gentle and loving humor this movie has the power to open us to new possibilities and offers hope for a world in which people see and accept each other as unique and precious individuals I look forward to more offerings from this creative and talented director
The movie only enter the cinema in Indonesia this year 2007 two years after it s official release and after many illegal DVD s had found its way to the public Apparently the popularity of the illegal DVD s lead to the release into the theaters with still public coming to watch br br The movie is a great epic bringing Japanese culture into your house in an exiting way In a sometimes humorist way the story is told about a theater writer who writes a story for his theater since the regular Kabuki theater plays is something he finds boring br br At first the audience might be a little bit confused about which story we are following but when the story unfolds we see that the love between a male human and a female demon leads to a great story for a new Kabuki theater piece br br The audience is left in the dark if this is a story that is supposed to really have happened in Japanese traditions and mythology but that doesn t matter br br The way the story is told with a love for theater expression vivid colors humor and tragedy makes this a great ride on the roller coaster of Japanese cinema as well as theater br br Let yourself go completely when you watch this movie try to see it in a cinema instead of on your television at home br br One critical point though the soundtrack is sometimes a little bit annoying Though most of it is great music there are a few moments in the movie that I think they should have chosen some more dramatic music But maybe the fact that the story contains moments of humor made the director choose for lighter moments in music as well
I went to see Ashura as 2005 Fantasia Festival Kickoff Man that was one cool kick off The director was supposed to be in Montreal for the Canadian premiere but due to health reasons he s still in Japan oh lord I hope he gets better and makes plenty of other movies br br The plot is pretty simple but somewhat original the demons are roaming in Edo in Japan and Swordsmans called Demon Wardens are slaying them and fearing the rebirth of Ashura the demon goddess who s sleeping and supposedly is very kick ass br br It brings us to Izumo some kind of elite swordsman called Demon Slayer and his buddy Jaku who s the typical violent jealous asshole br br Seems boring Well now it thickens br br Izumo took his retirement from killing demons since he slayed a young kid on the impression that he was the demon he never knew but he did killed her So Izumo went on with his life and recycled himself in Kabuki theater In a boat joyride on a nice night Izumo spots a girl hiding on a bridge and it changes his life and restart to slay demons for the good cause the cause of love and damn the guy knows how to handle a sword and to pull an entertaining massacre br br Izumo carries the movie as far as playing goes he is the total package he knows how to fight hell yeah he knows he s witty he s intelligent and he has that grit You never have to yell NO IZUMO IT S A TRAP The guy already knows it he has that common sense He s really the perfect hero br br As far as cinematography goes the esthetics are pretty interesting It s by far the movie that looks the most like a manga It s creamed full of special effects and nothing at all cost will prevent this movie to look realistic it s pretty amazing Lots of colours an unreal photography other than that it s pretty straightforward but like I said the main character is carrying the movie A must see a tale lead by masterful hands
Japan is in serious trouble Demons have infested Edo taking possession of earthly forms and bending them to their unholy will On top of that the rebirth of Ashura Queen of the demons is nigh The only thing that stands against this grave threat are the Demon Wardens a fearsome group of warriors who might just be as bad as the demons themselves br br Izumo is a retired Demon Warden who five years ago took up theater instead of Demon Slaying after accidentally killing a innocent child In a battle that s strangely reminiscent of the bar scene from Dusk till Dawn One night by a chance encounter he meets a beautiful and mysterious woman named Tsubaki Their fortunes intertwine literally and they are bound by fate to be lovers and enemies br br If you think this sounds like your typical Japanese Fantasy Swordplay epic you d be wrong In fact there s nothing typical about Ashura It is a hodge podge of many different genre s of film Those just mentioned as well as a comedy drama and romance Director Yojiro Takita Onmyoji juggles the genre s fairly respectfully Although the comedy seems forced in some scenes and the end result is a ridiculous but really fun popcorn movie br br To be sure there are flaws in the film Some of the humor seems contrived and out of place And the acting isn t the greatest But seriously do you watch Fantasy Swordplay Comedy films for the great acting performances No we watch them for the action and the crazy CG visuals all of which Ashura has in Spades Not to be misleading the film is not all action but it is spaced out generously enough with lots of swordplay and buckets of green blood to keep the average viewer happy br br Bottom line the films has it s faults and is not a martial arts epic but it doesn t try to be and it features interesting visuals and good swordplay action The reason the film worked for me is that it never takes itself too seriously and if the viewer does the same their sure to be delighted by this fun and silly swordplay fantasy action flick br br My Rating 7 out of 10 Fun popcorn movie
Set in Japan Ashura is the story of Demons taking over the earth The premise is far more complicated but the arching storyline should not be forgotten Japan is in turmoil with Demons occupying human form roaming the lands Generally speaking Demons look and act like humans but are evil The Japanese word they use is not just demons but rather the classical form of ogre which is a mythological creature of some historic stature We re talking about creatures that would appear more like gods than simple ugly child eating monsters br br However in human form all that remains is the green eyes and green teeth which appear when put under any sort of stress In order to save the world from Demons there are Demon slayers Trained and skilled warriors who can spot and defeat most every kind of demon and who guard the passage way between the realm of hell and that of the real world These are the basic premises br br The story begins with a festival in a local town Amid these festivities 3 men ride in dressed in all black seemingly intent on doing harm The villagers run excepting those which are demonic in nature who turn green eyed and try to kill them The Demon Slayers end up killing off the majority of the demons From here the story gets interesting The whole essence of the story begins when at the gate to hell a fortune telling demon appears before the 3 gate keepers revealing the arrival of Ashura With it comes the end of the reign of man and begins the reign of demons Ashura however requires some form of birthing process the first step of which occurred during the opening battle but which won t be revealed to you until you see the film The 3 demon slayers are a wise old man a powerful yet unprincipled man and a skilled and compassionate warrior Immediately you can see the split between them the old man wanting to stop the demons the powerful one wanting to bend them to his increasing ego maniacal wishes and the third looking to stop the second Along the way he meets a woman who he begins to take fancy to and believes himself to have a special relationship with She in turn is a brigand who is good natured sought after by authorities When the two finally meet face to face he places his hand on her shoulder and suddenly she is scathed by a mark on her shoulder Needless to say the mark is not a good sign What ensues is a battle for earth a battle between both good and evil as it should be but also between good and good itself br br The point for me of this film became something other than what I thought it would I came in thinking it would either be a fast paced action style film with demons or a horror film with macabre evil and foul creatures the likes of which would be seen in Ringu and Ju on I was however mistaken in the best possible way The story it seemed to me is an adaptation of a very old Japanese play and it plays itself out as such combining the essentially action driven adrenaline scenes with a great concept an amazing narrative and a style which makes you compelled to think rather than just sit wallowing in gore Many scenes are painted with luxurious dialogue between two characters the likes of which will never be seen in a Hollywood film It becomes a practically theatrical experience which takes your breath away br br The film makes use of some immaculate scenery and camera work comparable to many great Samurai films of our days but adding to it a well thought and classical plot With great acting great music and thoroughly stunning scenes its a must watch in my book br br That being said it does need the disclaimer that it is not for everyone Its not cheap thrills horror its not balls to the wall action Its a horror style play thats been filmed It has very much to say and takes the time to do so flying in the face of the conventional one liners Like Japanese plays the exchanges between the characters can last for many minutes before they come together for a quick yet marvelous battle scene If you can enjoy such a thing this is a masterpiece If your idea of a good film is slasher flicks with little plot and excessive nudity then you can easily watch something else br br Overall this film to me is a unique and amazing one which keeps you riveted and amused it has good writing good acting and good direction It is all in all a solidly great film
Very good drama about a young girl who attempts to unravel a series of horrible crimes She enlists the aid of a police cadet and they begin running down a series of clues which lead to a traveling carny worker with a long police record An ending which is guaranteed to keep you on the edge of your seat
This is a nice piece of work Very sexy and engaging enough plot to keep my interest throughout Its main disadvantage is that it seems like it was made for TV Full screen and though there were several sex scenes there was absolutely no nudity but boy did it come close Strange too since Netflix shows that it was rated R br br Nonetheless very titillating and I wish Alicia Silverstone made more movies like this br br One Netflix reviewer stated that it was part of a series but I have been unable to find out what series that is I d like to find out though because this movie was THAT good br br Walt D in LV 8 23 2005
i thought this movie was wonderfully plotted it made me confused and my cousin who watched it with me to tell the truth i think that the younger kevin dillon was hot hahahaha but i also thought the girl was stupid to go along with the cop and that was wrong what he said to her before his death i was inside you i think that s what she gets for doing what she did with him and how is he going to tell her that she s too young when he never cared how old the other girls were now i don t think i myself could ever trust a cop like that but to tell the truth it was pretty obvious it was him even if he was wanting to become a cop i would still be suspicious of him either way and that was funny when she sprayed him in the eye in the store hahahahaha she was still stupid for going into the warehouse again by herself and so was the cop who died HELLO it s called back up sometimes these movies make me mad when people act stupid and do stupid things but that s what i think an thought about the movie
I saw True Crime when it was first released back in the mid nineties and I have watched it many times since It is a great mystery about Mary played by Alicia Silverstone a high school senior in a California town who s classmate s younger sister was tortured and killed by an unknown murderer Mary meets Tony played by Kevin Dillon a police cadet who sees how bright she is and they decide to work together to try to find the killer br br Many suspects in this one True Crime feels very true or real to me I read a newsgroup review where someone wrote that total suspension of disbelief is present here and it is so true Alicia Silverstone is perfect in this role and Kevin Dillon and Bill Nunn do a great job as do the other actors The locations are right on and the writer director Pat Verducci really captures some of the realities of teenage life and of Mary s loneliness see the scene where Mary awakens from the dream sequence after having viewed the photos she took of Tony I wish Verducci would make more movies br br I have not seen any other movie quite like True Crime 10 10
i got to see the whole movie last night and i found it very exciting it was at least not like the teen slasher movies that pop out every now and then the search for the killer and the partner relationship between the hero the so called bad guy was parts i liked about the movie also i remember once being on the edge of my seat during a specific scene in the movie i mean it s exciting maybe some time later i might watch the movie again
I have seen this movie and even though I kind of knew who the killer was from the beginning I still liked watching it I would recommend it to other people It comes on Lifetime movie network quite a lot And I am thinking since it s close to Halloween they might play it more So please be on the look out for it if you are interested in watching it I believe that Alicia Silverstone played her part very well I really like her as an actress and person She seems so nice and down to earth Kevin Dillon he s performance was so so for me I am not trying to knock him or anything but I believe that his brother Matt would have been able to pull this bad evil serial killer persona better Kevin just seems too sweet for me But I think he did okay
This is the best made for TV movie of all time Am I saying this because I m a huge Silverstone fan Partially but even without her I d still see it I m a fan of serial killer genre films and believe this to be a great entry in that category Also Mary Giordano easily ranks among Alicia s top five character creations Totally memorable like she really exists I d have her on my side too if there was a mystery to be solved She plays the character like she does with her real life with complete confidence in everything she does Seems sweet honest nice just like she is in real life So is that acting Yes indeed she s sort of a rebel once again This time she s not bad she s too good and a bit afraid to do things that seem above the law But she doesn t do things the normal teenager would do Instead she spends her time reading detective mags and solves crimes A cliche abounds she s sort of avenging her father s death in a different way than vigilante style At the time Alicia seemed to be playing the same characters rebellious seductive without a parent a loner This happens here too but she s a bit nerdy this time around That doesn t matter she s still cool as a nerd Check this out soon or else Giordano will be investigating why you haven t
I searched out this one after seeing the hilarious and linguistically challenging Clueless 1995 perhaps Alicia Silverstone s best known effort from early in her film career True Crime has Kevin Dillon which should be helpful in improving most film projects In fact everyone in the cast does a good job The only disappointment I think the movie has for me is an awkward feel to some of the scenes coming from the need to run a quite uncompromising grown up theme as part of what in tone starts out as a schoolgirl adventure br br Alicia Silverstone is pretty good in this one She carries off well the naive enthusiasm and growing unease that affects Mary Giordano as she manoeuvres towards the truth behind the serial murders I reckon her characterization of MG has some mileage in it too The inference of the story line is that she goes on to a career in law enforcement It could be really interesting for an older Silverstone to revisit Giordano at a time of crisis later in the officer s life Just a thought br br True Crime shows its director in a good light Pat Verducci also has the writing credit I don t know of any other film work PV has done I can only wonder what happened after such a promising start br br Like most productions this one has a largely unknown supporting cast although Bill Nunn Detective Jerry Guinn is hardly that Over the past decade he seems to have been able to secure an impressive number of screen appearances I recall seeing him recently in Carriers 1998 a made for TV presentation with a military theme Bill Nunn played Captain Arends Fans of the classic US TV comedy show Who s the Boss may also have an interest in Carriers because the leading player is Judith Light remembered with affection by many because of her lengthy involvement with the show br br True Crime could easily not have worked but it does OK I think it is an entertaining story worth seeing
I must admit I m a little surprised and disappointed at some of the very negative comments this film seems to provoke I think its a great horror sci fi film Colonel Steve West Alex Rebar returns to Earth after an historical space flight to Saturn While in space he contracted some bizarre and unknown disease He wakes up in a hospital bed he looks in a mirror and before his very eyes his face is melting Escaping the hospitals supervision he hides out in some local woods surrounding a small town Unfortunately he starts to develop a rapidly growing hunger that can only be satisfied by eating other people He must feed on human flesh and drink the blood of others to survive Stalking human prey he begins his reign of terror Its up to his old friend Dr Ted Nelson Burr DeBenning to find him and try and help him He has to work alone as his boss General Perry Myron Healey wants it kept ultra quiet Nelson can t even tell his wife Judy Ann Sweeny However Sheriff Blake Micheal Alldredge becomes suspicious as General Perry turns up just as some of the local townspeople start turning up half eaten I don t really understand why this film gets such negative reviews what do people expect Anyway I really like this film The star of the film are unquestionably Rick Bakers Special Make up and gore effects which for the most part are excellent and the fact their all prosthetic effects and no rubbish horrible CGI makes them even better Writer and Director William Sachs isn t afraid to use them either we get some nice long lingering close up shots of the incredible melting man and they hold up very well even now Photography music and direction are a little bit dull but professional enough The script manages to create some sympathy for the the monster shots of him looking longingly into Ted Nelsons house or when he sees his own reflection in some water and reacts violently The ending set in a large factory of some sort is pretty downbeat so don t expect any happy ending Which surprised me Also the script doesn t really do anything with the premise he just walks around melting and killing with his friend trying to stop him maybe a bit too simple Personally I think the worst bit of the film is near the start when the fat nurse runs down a hospital corridor in slow motion her screams are also portrayed in slow motion too it looks and sounds totally ridiculous You need to see it to believe it I like this film a lot and recommend it to 70 s and 80 s horror sci fi fans A bit of a favourite of mine
To me there is something so appealing and nostalgic about low budget sci fi As a kid in the 50s thats all there was In 1957 I saw The First Man Into Space in a movie theater with my Dad It had Marshall Thompson starring and some other poor slob who got the title role It is also about a space mission gone bad where the astronaut turns into a grizzly killer Scared the Good Plenty right out of me The memory of those heebie jeebies still lives within me The Incredible Melting Man is almost a re make only in full glorious color that is wherever the scenes were well lit Just gotta love it for what it is a little over an hour of darkly lit scenes disgusting noises and that eerie music Bravo
THE MELTING MAN a tragic victim of the space race he perished MELTING never comprehending the race had LONG GONE BY br br A man Burr DeBenning burns his hand on the kitchen stove But instead of screaming something a NORMAL person would scream he shouts something that sounds like AAAAATCH KAH This movie you ve popped in isn t a normal movie You ve just taken your first step into THE INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN the famous late 70 s gore film featuring Rick Baker s wonderful makeup effects Baker was just on the edge of becoming a superstar and did this at the same time as his famous cantina aliens in STAR WARS For some strange reason STAR WARS became a household name and INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN did not br br It might have something to do with the fact that this movie is just mind numbingly awful From the opening credits Starring Alex Rebar as THE INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN that s really what it says to the chubby nurse running through a glass door to the fisherman s head going over a waterfall and smashing graphically apart on some rocks this film provides many many moments of sheer incomprehensibility Why did they but how come he why are they After a while you give up wondering why and watch it as what it is a very entertaining piece of garbage br br An astronaut returns to Earth in a melting radioactive condition he escapes and his mind disintegrating as well as his body begins a mad melting killing spree The authorities quickly decide that the melting man must be stopped but probably not wanting to cause a panic want him captured as quietly as possible So they send one guy with a geiger counter after him Wow br br Storywise surprisingly little happens during the movie The melting guy wanders around killing people A doctor searches for him with a geiger counter Various characters are introduced ask questions and leave Eventually the doctor catches up with the melting man but is shot by a security guard for no reason after he explains that he s Dr Ted Nelson The melting man wanders off and finally dissolves into a big puddle of goo The End br br It s so brainless that it somehow ends up being a lot of fun despite a fairly downbeat ending Supposedly a widescreen DVD release is planned A very special movie
Thanks to this fungal film I do NOT want my Maypo can t stomach the thought of Maltex or Wheatena and even that granola over there doesn t look so innocent anymore Why wasn t the song Slop Time by the Sherrys used as the theme
As a collector of movie memorabilia I had to buy the movie poster for this film which now that I ve finally seen it has to be the best thing about it There s nothing more attractive to hang on your wall than a 27x41 inch image of the melting man However there s nothing more awful to put in your VCR than an hour and a half long image of the melting man At first I thought this movie was pure garbage but then I realized that it did have some qualities which made me laugh The character of Dr Ted Nelson has to be the most wishy washy persona ever brought to the big screen His dialogue is so trite it s unbelievable It s incredible He seems to be getting stronger as he melts br br And could somebody tell me please how the heck they know exactly how much time Steve has left before he melts completely and exactly what their plan is to help him If this movie was meant to scare its audience I think it missed its calling
Astronaut Steve West Alex Rebar and his comrades undertake a space mission that sees them flying through the rings of Saturn His comrades are killed instantly but it would seem that they are in fact the lucky ones Steve returns to Earth a constantly oozing mass of humanoid pulp as he turns into a savage killer melting every step of the way he is tracked by his friend Dr Ted Nelson Burr DeBenning br br This is often so uproariously funny with enough absurd lines and situations to go around that it s hard for me to believe that the laughs are all unintentional It seems to me to be kind of a goof on low budget genre efforts from the 50 s and 60 s and as such it s a marvelously entertaining movie That sequence with the nurse is simply hilarious We re even treated to a split screen sequence that doesn t really add anything but is still a gas to watch br br Writer director William Sachs deserves credit for coming up with this ingenious idea his ultra slimy character is a memorable one indeed I think his pacing is a little off some scenes like the one with the elderly couple go on a little long but ultimately he delivers solid schlocky B movie goods with a degree of panache The climax is especially fun br br Arlon Obers music is enjoyably shuddery yet also amusingly silly during some moments and Willy Curtis s cinematography creates some really great shots at times That brings me to Rick Bakers fantastic and convincing makeup effects which form a highly respectable centerpiece for the movie right down to the ultimate final melt br br Rebar is under the heavy makeup for almost the entire movie Sachs also gets my praise for having the movie hit the ground running and does what he has to do well enough DeBenning makes for a rather oafish and silly hero and Ann Sweeney isn t so hot either as his wife but Myron Healey Michael Alldredge and Lisle Wilson are fine in support It s also worth it to see folk like Cheryl Rainbeaux Smith doing an appreciable topless shot Janus Blythe of Tobe Hoopers Eaten Alive and Wes Cravens The Hills Have Eyes and even director Jonathan Demme in a bit part br br This is a highly entertaining midnight movie with enough gore chills and laughs to rate it as worth catching for lovers of low grade sci fi horror everywhere br br 8 10
First off anyone looking for meaningful outcome oriented cinema that packs some sort of social message with meaningful performances and soul searching dialog spoken by dedicated emotive heartfelt thespians please leave now You are wasting your time and life is short go see the new Brangelina Jolie movie have a good cry go out buy a hybrid car or throw away your conflict diamonds if that will make you feel better and leave us alone br br Don t let the door hit you on the way out either THE INCREDIBLE MELTING MAN is a grade B minus regional horror epic shot in the wastelands of Oklahoma by a young TV friendly cast crew and concerns itself with an astronaut who is exposed to bizarre radiation effects wakes up in a hospital and finds that his body is liquefying on him as he sits there feeling like a chump The melting man is played by one Alex Rebar who is recognizable for about the first four minutes of the film But once he starts oozin with Rick Baker s extraordinary special effects makeup he more resembles something you might find in a tin of spam before you drain off all the runny viscous blebs of grease br br The film has zero exposition and does not bandy about with plot points There are a couple of scenes involving scientist types riding around on an absurd industrial conveyor machine who dutifully recite a few obligatory lines about the effects of radiation but the movie does not care really It s a freak show and a marvelous one at that with a decidedly sick sense of humor for those who can stomach it One great laugh comes when the melting man stumbles upon a young girl in the forest and is so at a loss for what to do that one of his eyes pops out Hilarious br br The hero of the film is played by Burr DeBenning a fascinating character actor from the golden 1970s 80s television scene who was sort of an early model for the Kevin Spacey prototype slightly twisted neurotic and one step ahead of most everyone in the room even if he looks confused He appeared just after this movie was made in a bizarre made for TV anthology horror piece called HOUSE OF THE DEAD or THE ALIEN ZONE that is regarded as one of the finest movies ever made in Oklahoma which is where I suspect this film was made as well The arid cold looking rural midwestern landscapes are certainly the same and the creek that one unfortunate fly fisher chooses for his afternoon of sport appears to be the same one that Cameron Mitchell fought off flying alien pancakes in WITHOUT WARNING which also had a sick sense of humor a TV friendly cast and some pretty outrageous gore I definitely sense at least an aesthetic connection between the three movies as well as THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS which is of no surprise considering that director Jonathan Demme is a part of MELTING MAN s cast br br Essentially as others have pointed out this is a 1950s B movie plot updated for later 1970s era special effects the inevitable boobs The movie it probably borrows most of it s ideas from is PHANTOM FROM SPACE with Peter Graves as an astronaut who also returns to Earth after being exposed to funky radiation effects that set him off on a killing spree One of the things that I actually admire about the film is that absolutely no regard is given for the melting man s motivations He simply goes on a rampage and the movie s drama comes from wondering if he s going to fall to pieces before certain characters fall victim to his madness The budget for the film is also delightfully low and every dime spent on it is up there on the screen Rick Baker s disgusting effects getting the lion s share of whatever was spent on this br br Sick disgusting fun best enjoyed with a crowd of friends and plenty of beer Why can t people have made more movies like these br br 8 10
The Incredible Melting Man is a fantastically gross trashy and energetic Z grade production that every self respecting camp horror freak simply has to see for him herself The ideal way to describe this low budget 70 s gem is like a shameless copy of Hammer s The Quatermass Xperiment only a thousand times filthier Astronaust Steve West is the only survivor of a disastrous space mission but turns out the carrier of a horrible disease that makes him radioactive and causes him to melt In shock after seeing his face in the mirror can you blame him Steve busts out of the hospital leaving a trail of sticky pus and fallen off body parts behind Doctor Ted Nelson has to find him urgently as the disease also set Steve up with an insatiable appetite for human flesh The premise may sound utterly stupid but this flick is enormously entertaining and contains great make up effects from the hand of Rick Baker The melting dude s face looks like a rotting pizza and his heavy breathing makes him sound like Darth Vader Another big advantage is that William Sachs screenplay doesn t waste any time on tedious scientific explanations or emotional speeches The repulsiveness starts right away and lasts until the very last moment of the film Just enjoy this silly horror gem and try to switch off your brain activity as much as you can because if you start contemplating about the many stupidities in the script you ll miss out on all the campy fun
I saw this movie in 1959 when I was 11 years old at a drive in theater with my family br br Way back then I thought it was very funny even though I was too young to understand 90 of what makes this marvelous movie such a delight I saw it again this morning on Turner South As I watched it I was absolutely convulsed with laughter The Mating Game is a unique classic from a by gone age If you re too young to have experienced the enchanting period in history that produced this film I feel very sorry for you There s no way you can watch movies like this and understand how they can even today deliver such a delightful slice of heaven to old timers like me br br Having said that all I can do is respectfully request that younger people refrain from commenting on films like The Mating Game br br Movies like this were made for the generation that preceded the current group of your people And as such these films speak a very different language than any of you can understand br br In other words if you don t understand the issues the film is addressing please don t embarrass yourself by offering comments which frankly make no sense

I have always liked this comedy as one of the few ever seriously trying to deal with the U S Government s yearly demand for taxes Ever read a tax code it is quite a trial to follow it s multiple clauses that our congressmen and senators push in to help their financial backers and various interest groups Despite claims that it is fair the tax code has always laid the lion share of the burden on the middle and working classes rather than the rich and influential Most of the various special clauses are meant for their use go through the average 1040 or 1040A form and look at the variety of different investment and business ventures all of which have a different set of rules Most people will never have any use for these br br The story here is that a wealthy landowner Philip Ober uses his influence to tip off the IRS that his neighbors Paul Douglas and Una Merkle have not payed taxes in 20 years The Baltimore office of the IRS is under Fred Clarke and he is snapping to attention for Ober with his influence He sends Tony Randall to check out the situation br br Randall finds that Douglas Merkle and their three girls and two boys are pretty decent people who rarely have need for cash they get along on their farm produce and barter with their neighbors But Randall trained in the clear to the IRS lines of the tax code tries to pin down the family to fundamentals But gradually Douglas notes that Reynolds is fond of Randall and he keeps sidetracking Randall from his chore eventually getting him drunk He also makes it difficult for Randall to leave by having the motor of his car removed for repairs by his two sons br br The plot follows the growing attraction and frictions between urban vaguely ambitious Randall and countryside life loving Reynolds They make a cute couple actually Eventually after Ober complains Randall is sent back in disgrace and Clarke a tougher cookie gets down to brass tacks And comes up with a very large tax bill that will possibly ruin Douglas s family br br The film does not end there it does end happily but it does remind us that the power to tax is the power to destroy and that the Government does all too frequently go in for destruction A chance in a million reversal saves the family but it is so rare that we know it is just a dramatic trick More realistic is how Clarke s boss Charles Lane cuts to the essence regarding Ober s help by suggesting that next year his taxes will be looked at more carefully After that Ober is rather green
Excellent farce Which of course is all it is intended to be Thankfully there is neither a social or political message nor is there the slightest attempt in that direction Could the plot actually take or have taken place in any particular time or location Unlikely for after all this is simply merely a movie and movies spring from imagination not from reality The only goal of this movie is to entertain certainly not to educate and entertain it does with reality delightfully and lightheartedly tossed to the winds I think most would agree that from documentaries we expect enlightenment and authenticity But for entertainment I want what is nowadays described as a no brainer which The Mating Game is in all respects For a few chuckles and an outright laugh now and then this is fine fare fantasy
If you are the sort of person looking for a realistic film or one with a strong and believable plot then this film is NOT for you Nope you ll hate it However for those who like sweet slightly screwball comedies then you ll have a nice time watching this slight film br br Tony Randall works for the IRS and he investigates a very nice farmer who never realized he needed to file an income tax return However hard he tries to convince them of the seriousness of his visit everyone in the family is thrilled to have company They dote on him and treat him like one of the family and have plans on getting him hitched to their daughter Debbie Reynolds That s really about all the plot there is But the film gets high marks for a fun script and decent acting A really nice little curio from the late 1950s
Many critics have felt offended that R W Fassbinder has portrayed both protagonist Wilkie and the Nazis in this movie in a human like manner Connoisseurs of other Fassbinder films however will realize that Lili Marleen 1981 belongs to Fassbinder s women movies like The Marriage of Maria Braun 1979 and Lola 1981 Fassbinder was convinced that stories can be told much better with women than with men because according to Fassbinder while men usually fulfill their determined roles in society women are capable of thinking in a dialectic manner Dialectics however means that there is not only a thesis and its antithesis like usually in our black and white world but a synthesis where the oppositions coincide Moreover dialectic means that because of the third instance of synthesis the absolute opposition of the difference between thesis and antithesis is abolished Concretely speaking Starting from a dialect point of view and portraying the fascist state the underground fighters must necessarily use the basic means like the rulers do and between offenders and victims there is thus a chiastic relation so that every offender is also victim and every victim is also offender Fassbinder has illustrated this abstract scheme that transcends classical logic in his play The City the Garbage and the Death 1975 which was filmed by Daniel Schmid under the title Shadow of Angels 1976 br br Therefore approaching an a priori controversial topic like Nazi Germany in a dialectic manner the depiction of this time in the form of a movie gets even more controversial especially for people who cannot or do not want to see that our recognition of the world is by far not exhausted with a primitive light switch schema but needs the third instance of synthesis as controlling instance of its opposite members thesis and antithesis The mutual relationship between offenders and victims has to scrutinized since it is simply not true that the offenders are the bad ones and the victims the good ones In a synthetic viewpoint the bad ones participate on the goodness as the good ones participate on the badness They are mutually related In a world view based on classical logic a relation between good and bad cannot even been established and in an ethics based on this insufficient system of logic the bad conscience of the survivors of Nazi Germany feeling illogically enough responsible for the deeds of their ancestors exclude the possibility of a relationship between the two extremes and thus a synthesis in the form a new evaluation based on this relationship as well From Fassbinder s dialectic viewpoint it follows that neither Lili Marleen nor Lola nor Maria Braun can be condemned for their misuse of the ruling system for their private purposes because they don t misuse them they just use them In the opposite since victims must repeat the actions of the offenders as the offenders must repeat the actions of the victims because good and bad are no longer simple mirror images of one another like in two valued logic their strategies are legitimated by the chiastic structure of a logic that describes our world that is not black and white at all much better than a black and white logic
I consider this movie a masterpiece but it took me at least 4 o 5 times to see it so as to realize what a great movie it was First it describes a face of WW2 that we don t usually see in Hollywood movies In particular German soldiers army and the Nazi government are shown more humanized One of the facts that impressed me most was the mention by the end of the movie of a murder that took place in a forest in the last 20 s that forest is the place where the final chapters of Berlin Alexanderplatz take place those are the woods where Reinhold kills Mieze Another clue for those who like the details is the representation of doors Fassbinder is obsessed with the changes in people each time they walk across a door or a door is opened Many doors are shown in the screen opened and closed And the characters change in their personality their acts etc any time that happens Have you noticed that
Kate Beckinsale is as good if not better than Gwyneth Paltrow as Emma in this movie although I really liked Gwyneth Paltrow in the other Emma version They re both good in different ways Kate Beckinsale as Emma seems more interesting almost though And I liked the woman who played Harriet Smith in this movie better too she was more believably sweet and sentimental There are certain things I like better about the Gwyneth Paltrow version though like how the humorous side is more apparent
As winter approaches our state owned broadcaster the ABC has decided for some reason to have a partial Jane Austen Festival on Sunday nights This commenced with a twelve year old movie length version of Emma last Sunday more recent versions of three other novels Persuasion Northanger Abbey and Mansfield Park are to come br br The curious thing about this production by A E Television Networks with script by the ever reliable Andrew Davies is that it appeared almost simultaneously with two much bigger budget movie versions one starring Gwyneth Paltrow and Clueless a modernized version starring Alicia Silverstone which transported the plot to Beverly Hills Perhaps as a result even with Kate Beckinsale in the lead this production sank without trace br br As a general rule much is lost when novels are shrunk to fit feature movie length The adaptations one tends to both enjoy and remember are those which have adequate room to develop both story and characters An outstanding example is Brideshead Revisited which had 13 50 minute episodes back in 1982 You only have to compare the very ordinary movie length version of Pride and Prejudice in 2005 with the brilliant 1995 six part TV mini series It s not that a novel should be filmed page by page and some novels often not very good ones adapt wonderfully to film Atonement is a recent example but novels of the Jane Austen sort need some time and space to exert their full charm br br Given the shortcomings of this type of adaptation this production is OK Kate Beckinsale gives Emma the right mix of self assuredness and vulnerability and Mark Strong is a forthright Mr Knightly he reminded me that Jane tended to recycle characters Knightly is a more articulate version of the moody Mr Darcy of P P Samantha Morton was a rather limp Harriet but Prunella Scales got the blabbermouth Miss Bates perfectly Sybil Fawlty on speed Bernard Hepton as Emma s feeble father was also excellent We saw the damp countryside the mud and the poverty as well as the posh interiors in case anyone thought this was a particularly idyllic age for everybody br br Even though this was a condensed adaptation it was oddly slow in places some of the conversations were rather stilted even allowing for the formalities of the times I d have to look at the film again to be sure but it might be due to the under use of reaction shots br br If you do like filmed period stuff this is a perfectly nice example and compares well with the Paltrow version Anyway there is more to come
This is the best Emma in existence in my opinion Having seen the other version 1996 which is also good and read the book I think I can safely say with confidence that this is the true interpretation and is the most faithful to Jane Austen s masterpiece The 1996 movie with G Paltrow is good too it s just that it s almost like a different story altogether It s very light and fluffy you don t see the darker edges of the characters and if you just want a pleasant movie that one would do fine but the intricacies of some of the plot points such as the Churchill Fairfax entanglement is so much glossed over as to be virtually non existent But if you want the characters fleshed out a bit more real and multidimensional the 1996 TV version is the superior Emma is a remarkable person but she is flawed Kate Beckinsale is masterful at showing the little quirks of the character You see her look casually disgusted at some of the more simple conversation of Harriet Smith yet she shows no remorse for having ruined Harriet s proposal until that action has the effect of ruining her own marital happiness at the ending You see her narcissism and it mirrors Frank Churchill s in that they would do harm to others to achieve their own aims For Emma it was playing matchmaker and having a new friend to while away the time with after having suffered the loss of her governess to marriage For Frank Churchill it is securing the promise of the woman he loves while treating her and others abominably to keep the secret In the book she realizes all of this in a crushing awakening to all the blunders she has made Both Kate Beckinsale and Gyneth Paltrow are convincing in their remorse but Paltrow s is more childlike and stagnant while Beckinsale s awakening is rather real and serious and you see the transition from child like selfish behavior to kind and thoughtful adult Both versions are very good but I prefer this one
The minute I started watching this I realised that I was watching a quality production so I was not surprised to find that the screenplay was written by Andrew Davis and was produced by Sue Birtwhistle both of these brought us the excellent 1995 production of Pride and Prejudice So my only gripe here is that Emma did not run to 3 or 4 or maybe even six episodes like Pride and Prejudice The acting was superb with I think Prunella scales excellent as Miss Bates but I loved Kate Beckinsale and Mark Strong just as much The language is a delight to listen to can you imagine in this day and age having a right go at someone without actually uttering a swear word Samantha Morton was excellent as Miss Smith in fact the casting was spot on much as it was with Pride and Prejudice I liked it so much that I watched it twice in two days So once again thank you BBC for another quality piece of television I have seen the Paltrow version and it is okay but I do think the BBC version is far superior An excellent production that I am very happy to own on DVD
i really loved this version of Emma the best Kate beckinsale was awesome as Emma and mark strong was very good as knightly the only complaint that i had was on Mr woodhouse i can t believe that a man could whine so much or be so selfish with his daughter s life she was a smart girl in the end though as always i love the places in which these Jane Austin movies were shot the settings are so spectular it makes me want to visit england so much 9as well as Ireland and Scotland i think the actors chosen for this movie were a good choice as well and all the other story lines interwhined with Emma s most excellently i am glad that i got to see this one as well
Until the 1990s there had never been a film based upon Jane Austen s Emma Then two came along in the same year 1996 Or if you count 1995 s Clueless which updates Austen s plot to a modern American high school three in two years br br The main character is Emma Woodhouse a young lady from a well to do family in Regency England She is financially considerably better off than most Austen heroines such as Elizabeth Bennett or Fanny Price and has no need to find herself a wealthy husband Instead her main preoccupation seems to be finding husbands for her friends She persuades her friend Harriet to turn down a proposal of marriage from a young farmer Robert Martin believing that Harriet should be setting her sights on the ambitious clergyman Mr Elton This scheme goes disastrously wrong however as Elton has no interest in Harriet but has fallen in love with Emma herself The speed with which Emma rejects his proposal makes one wonder just why she was so keen to match her friend with a man she regards with good reason as an unsuitable marriage partner for herself This being a Jane Austen plot Emma turns out to be less of a committed spinster than she seems and she too finds herself falling in love leading to further complications br br Today in 2008 Kate Beckinsale is a Hollywood star but in 1996 despite being only a year younger was not nearly as well known internationally as Gwyneth Paltrow She is however just as convincing as Austen s well intentioned but often wrong headed heroine Beckinsale seems to have a gift for classical roles she made a delightful Hero in Kenneth Branagh s version of Much Ado about Nothing and I sometimes find myself wishing that Hollywood could have found more suitable roles for her rather than wasting her in turkeys like Pearl Harbor or Underworld br br I preferred Jeremy Northam to Mark Strong as Emma s love interest Mr Knightley largely because he came closer to my own conception of the character as a gentlemanly chivalrous older man in some ways more of a father figure to Emma than a lover His surname is probably meant to indicate his gentlemanly nature nineteenth century gentlemen liked to think of themselves as the modern equivalent of mediaeval knights with their elaborate codes of chivalry Strong tends to downplay the question of the age difference he is 37 she 21 and makes Knightley more of a passionate lover and less of a wise mentor than does Northam Samantha Morton another actress who would go on to bigger things is perhaps closer to the Harriet of the novel than was Toni Collette br br This was the more small scale of the two versions being made for television rather than the cinema and the sets and costumes seem less lavish and there are fewer big names among the cast Costume drama however is generally something that British television does well and this version can certainly hold its own with the cinema version both are entertaining and well made versions of Austen s novel 7 10
Old Jane s mannered tale seems very popular these days I have lost count of the number of versions going around Probably the reason is that her ruts are our ruts even at this late date This TV mini series gives it a mannered telling suitable to the novel Headstrong opinionated Emma is a pretty modern girl when you think about it even though the ambience of Jane Austen s world may seem a tad artificial to us today If you haven t seem EMMA I ll only say that self sufficient Emma does get her comeuppance It s worth watching to find out how The acting honours here go to the ladies Kate Prunella Lucy and Samantha They could almost have had a psychic connection to old Jane
Kate Beckinsale steals the show Bravo Too bad Knightly ins t as good looking as Jeremy Northam Mark Strong did a fabulous job Bernard Hepton was perfect as Emmas father I love the end scene which is an addition to the novel but well written when the harvest is in and Knightly dines with his workers and high society friends Emma must show that she accepts this now She is a changed woman That is too much too quick but OK I ll buy into it Samantha Bond plays Emma s ex governess and confidant She is wonderful just as I would have imagined her I believe that when the UK does a Jane Austen its the best American versions of English literature are done for money and not for quality See this one
It has taken me a while to watch this version as unfortunately I don t seem to be able to rent it in the video store only the other version but I fell in love with it I was always borderline with the other Emma Gwenneth and Toni Collette as they are not British naturally have to put on the accent and well to me it doesn t seem natural It seems put on Sorry but don t think Toni and Gwenneth did a brilliant job there I could not warm to any of the characters but this version is more heart warming and more the type of person I imagined Emma to be It is definitely the version I will come back to from now on I was disappointed that Mr Knightley was not better looking but he is convincing I also like Jane Fairfax better played by Olivia Williams I never warmed to her in the movie version but she is better portrayed in this version Come to think of it besides Mr Knightley all characters are better played and a lot less over the top Unfortunately both came out around same time and the Paltrow version got more publicity Pity I also love the new scene at the end Well done to Kate Beckingsale Therefore if you are a Jane Austen fan don t forget to watch this one
I ve really enjoyed this adaptation of Emma I have seen it many times and am always looking forward to seeing it again Though it only lasts 107 minutes most of the novel plot and sub plots were developed in a satisfactory way All the characters are well portrayed Most of the dialogues come directly from the novel with no silly jokes added as in Emma Thompson s Sense and Sensibility br br As a foreigner I particularly appreciate the perfect diction of the actors The setting and costumes were beautiful I find this version quite on a par with the 1995 miniseries Pride and Prejudice but then the producer and screenwriter were the same Kate Beckinsale did a really good job portraying Emma of whom Jane Austen said she would create a heroin no one but her would love She is snobbish but has just enough youth and inexperience to be still likable Mark Strong was also very good at portraying Mr Knightley not an easy part I think though he has not the charisma shown by Colin Firth s Mr Darcy in Pride and Prejudice Even the end scene the harvest festival which does not happen in the novel provides a fitting end except for when it shows Emma being cold and almost unpleasant with Frank Churchill whereas in the novel she was thoroughly reconciled with him even telling him that she would have enjoyed the duplicity had she been in his situation A strange departure from the faithfulness otherwise shown throughout the film I find the costumes more beautiful and elaborate than in other adaptations from Jane Austen s novels
This has long been one of my favourite adaptations of an Austen novel Although it is definitely not in the same category as the spectacular Pride and Prejudice Emma is a lush and relatively faithful TV version of Austen s novel especially considering its short length The biggest change between the novel and the movie is a good one as the unnecessary snobbishness that Austen exhibits at the end of the story is removed here and replaced with someone much more akin to Emma s character in the rest of the book I thought the characters chosen to portray the roles were well picked Kate Beckinsale walks the fine line between girlishness and the social snob with a grace completely lost in Gwyneth Paltrow s 96 version Samantha Morton s wispy blonde locks suit her attitude and character as the simper that accompanies her role in previous characterisations is replaced with the Harriet we know from the book Mister Knightly s role is carried out extremely well in my opinion both the seriousness and the gentle compassion that the hero is painted with in the novel are present here in this much neglected sumptuous film
I ve seen this movie after watching Paltrow s version I ve found that one a very good one and I thought this would not be as good but I was wrong British version was far better and enjoyable I found Jeremy Northam more agreeable than Mark Strong but I can say that Strong catches much better Austen s Knightley Anyway both versions are good but anyone that loved Austen s books should watch this movie I agree with caalling Andrew Davies changed a few things but still remains faithful to the original br br 10 out of 10 br br My 2 cents
Of the spate of Austen films from the 1990s this is my favorite more even than Persuasion which was the one that converted me to Austeniana Before seeing this Emma I had seen two previous versions but in one Emma seemed all wrong more like Lady Teazle and in the other she seemed half wrong like a possible impostor whereas here she seemed just right young and silly and stubborn In general I thought the attitude and the atmosphere of the production conveyed the charm of the novel exceedingly well indeed it is one of the sweetest merriest things I have ever seen rather in the nature of a Christmas treat The script is unusually well formed and the adapter s additions like the shaft of light that reveals Harriet to Emma in church are all in keeping Mark Strong as Knightley is not what I would have expected but I enjoyed him very much he strongly brings out the plain spoken practical side of the character in contrast with Emma s affectations and his choleric outbursts against Frank Churchill are quite funny Bernard Hepton makes Mr Woodhouse a figure of almost Carrollian absurdity Samantha Morton as Emma s prot√©g√© is exactly as soft and exactly as firm as she ought to be And as in the same producers Pride and Prejudice care is taken that the eventual couplings of characters can be believed uniquely in some cases For me this production was and remains a delight
Kate Beckinsale is excellent as the manipulative and yet irresistibly charming Emma in this TV adaptation of Jane Austen s novel When I read that novel I was sometimes quite doubtful whether the protagonist really deserved to be considered the heroine of the story for honestly she is so terribly self righteous and scheming that one is tempted to dislike her seriously Kate Beckinsale s interpretation however saves Emma from herself so to speak she is portrayed with all the innocence and generosity of her character in full view and one can t help but give in and like not to say love her in spite of her less amiable qualities Kate Beckinsale is the main but not the only reason why this TV series is so delightful Raymond Coulthard is perfect as Mr Frank Churchill expressing this character s personal magnetism to the full which is all the more conspicuous because of this role being not very well handled by Ewan McGregor in the 1996 screen adaptation of Emma and Mark Strong Samantha Morton Bernard Hepton and Olivia Williams are all as they should be in their respective roles This production is in short a great achievement and one to view many times with increasing pleasure
This is a better adaptation of the book than the one with Paltrow although I liked that one too It isn t so much that Beckinsale is better they are both very good but that the screenplay is better Davies is a master at adapting Austen for filming and the production values here are very good It s not quite as glossy as the Hollywood treatment but it s close and I thought that the locations and the costumes actually worked better
Jane Austen s Emma is an extremely enjoyable story at the worst of times and this production of the story is the best I have ever seen Kake Beckinsale s Emma is irreproachable Gwyneth Paltrow with the help of a good screenplay and excellent cinematography is able to bring out the comedy effectively she fails to make Emma likeable Paltrow is not aided by the fact that her hairstyles are simply wrong for the part and I believe the era and she looks positively ill in the empire line dresses Kate Beckinsale on the other hand manages the comedy effortlessly and is still able to show what Mr Knightly the most romantic of Jane Austen s heroes actually sees in her Mark Strong is a splendid Mr Knightly with the right mix of handsome looks an appropriate age chivalry compassion and gentlemanly behaviour Emma and Mr Knightly are supported by a cast of good actors and the production as a whole is quite delightful
A Family Affair takes us back to a less complicated time in America It s sobering to see how different everything was back then It was a more innocent era in our country and we watch a functional family dealing in things together The film also marks the beginning of the series featuring the Hardy family br br The film directed by George Seitz is based on a successful play Judge James Hardy and his wife Emmily are facing a domestic crisis that must be dealt with Married daughter Joan comes home after she has committed a social blunder and her husband holds her responsible At the same time another daughter Marion brings home a beau who is clear will clash with her father The happy teen ager Andy seems to be the only one without a problem until his mother makes him escort Polly to the dance something he is reluctant to do br br Needless to say Judge Hardy will prove why he knows best as he puts a plan into action to get everyone together again After all he is a man that understands not only the law but how to deal with those outside forces that threatens his standing in the community and what will make his family happy br br Lionel Barrymore plays Judge Hardy with conviction He is the glue that holds everything together Spring Byington is seen as Emily the mother Mickey Rooney has a small part in this film but he is as always fun to watch Cecilia Parker and Julie Haydon appeared as the daughters Marion and Joan Sara Hayden and Margaret Marquis are also featured in the film as Aunt Milly and Polly the girl that surprises Andy with her beauty br br A Family Affair is a good way to observe our past through the positive image painted of an American family
This is a excellent start to the film career of Mickey Rooney His talents here shows that a long career is ahead for him The car and truck chase is exciting for the 1937 era This start of the Andy Hardy series is an American treasure in my book Spring Byington performance is excellent as usual Please Mr Rooney or owners of the film rights take a chance and get this produced on DVD I think it would be a winner
Tintin and I recently aired as an episode of PBS s P O V series It s based on a taped interview of Georges Remi a k a Herge Tintin s creator from 1971 in which in discusses his various experiences publishing his popular character first in a Catholic newspaper then in his own series of comic books Awesome sweeping views of various comic pages and surreal images of Herge s dreams I first encountered Tintin in the pages of Children s Digest at my local elementary school library reading The Secrets of the Unicorn My mom later got a subscription to CD and I read the entire Red Rackham s Treasure every month in 1978 I remember seeing some Tintin comic books in a local book store after that but for some reason I didn t get any probably because I was 12 and I thought I was outgrowing them I do have Breaking Free a book written and drawn by J Daniels published in 1989 six years after Herge s death Haven t read it yet This film also covers the artist s personal life as when he left his first wife after his affair with a colorist in his employ whom he later married Her name is Fanny and she is interviewed here If you love Tintin and his creator this film is definitely worth a look Update 9 4 07 I ve now read Breaking Free Tintin and The Captain are the only regular characters that appear here and they are tailored to the anti capitalist views of Mr Daniels with Tintin portrayed as a rabble rouser with a chip on his shoulder who nevertheless cares for The Captain who he s staying with The Captain here is just trying to make ends meet with a wife and daughter that he loves dearly They and other construction workers vow to strike after a fellow employee dies from a faulty equipment accident The whole thing takes place in England with working class cockney accents intact Not the kind of thing Herge would approve of but an interesting read nonetheless Oh yes dog Snowy only appears in the top left corner of the cover which has Tintin running over the police and the dedication page
Some thirty years ago Author Numa Sadoul published a book length interview with the Belgian comic book artist Georges Remi better known as Herge the creator of Tintin This movie catches up with Sadoul today as he recalls the interview while we listen to the cassettes Herge died in 1983 and see some old photos and footage of the man himself Some parts of the interview were not published in the book at the request of Herge and we now know these dealt with his separation from his wife after he had an affair with one of his collaborators who years later would become his second wife An interesting thing the movie does not address well is the shift in the Tintin books from the early rightist and imperialist books Tintin in the Congo Tintin in the lands of the Soviets to fairly anti imperialist books just a few years later The Blue Lotus On the whole I come out of this movie knowing a few more things about Herge and seeing him as a bit more unlikable than when I come in to the theater
This is a brilliant documentary that follows the life of Herge and his creating TinTin Its based around a series of interviews conducted in 1971 and covers every thing from his early life and Nazi collaboration to the final moments of his life br br Brilliantly edited very cinematic and fast paced enough to not get boring This film will give you a new appreciation for the work of Herge br br The film makers make the film more than just another documentary Using the latest state of the art technology and for a change putting it to good use br br Recently more and more documentaries have been making it to cinemas But this one as to be amongst the best
If you as I have a very close and long relationship with the world of Tintin do yourself a favor and watch this beautiful documentary about Herg√© and his life creating Tintin I ts so brilliant and a very cool production The whole background story about Herg√© and the people and also very much the many different situations he was influenced by for good and worse is amazing There is a very fine and obvious connection between the comic books and just this I will for sure be in my basement digging up the Tintin albums again Also the movie itself are very well told and has a great ambient sound to it I really do hope people will find this as intriguing as I did
Tintin and I first of all struck me as a masterpiece documentary The photography and the editing are truly breath taking almost anti Dogma br br We follow the life of Tintin drawer Herg√© through an open hearted interview from 1971 The Tintin series was drawn on the background of the great ideological fights of the twentieth century In the midst of these Herg√© has his own demons to fight with and much of his drawing activity seems like an attempt to tame these and to escape into a world of perfection br br Even though there are spectacular photographic panoramas of drawings from Tintin albums and also some reconstructions and reading of passages from the albums the story of Herg√© is told entirely through interviews and archive material and never through reconstructions br br Herg√© lived the turbulent life of a true suffering artist But the fantastic world that came of his imagination will continue to amaze readers again and again
Imagine that I was about to miss this great cultural event on Swedish TV last night and it was only because my girlfriend insisted on keeping the TV on to make it easier for her to fall asleep that I came across it yes I had seen an advert for it previously but of course forgotten about it and looked forward to an early night br br Anyway this must surely be a rather unusual idea to base a film documentary on an interview made with sound only more than 30 years ago But with animated and other documentary film material it adds up to a really good and insightful portrait of one of the 20th centuries most appreciated literary artists Georges Remy a k a Herg√© br br I for sure will read my Tintin albums with a different eye after having seen this film which makes it easier to connect the variations in style as well as content with the different periods in Herg√© s life and I can tell you that I will a s a p get the few that I don t have Of course my perception of the albums has changed over the more than 25 years that I have already been reading them as has my view about what albums are my favourites but this adds at least one more dimension to them
Tintin was one of my favorite heroes as a kid I used to borrow the books from the school library every chance I got My favorite one was The Red Sea Sharks so much action and humor br br This documentary was a brilliant exposition of the background story of Herge and his development of Tintin The film maker s personal experience in interviewing Herge and the story of his relationship with the artist who was the inspiration for the Chan character was very moving br br A great documentary of a very talented and well loved artist A great example of someone who has become internationally renown and has brought joy of millions of children and the young at heart all over the world
Seven young people go to the forest looking for a bear Soon they are all stalked and viciously murdered by a crazy Vietnam veteran Trampa Infernal is a pretty entertaining Mexican slasher that reminds me a lot The Zero Boys The film is fast paced and there are some good death scenes like throat slashing or axe in the neck Unfortunately there is not much gore so fans of grand guignol will be disappointed However if you are a fan of slasher movies give this rarity a look Mexican horror flicks are quite obscure I have seen only Alucarda and Don t Panic so this should be another reason to see this enjoyable slasher My rating 7 out of 10 Highly recommended
Four macho rough n tumble guys and three sexy gals venture into a remote woodland area to hunt for a bear The motley coed group runs afoul of crazed Vietnam veteran Jesse an effectively creepy portrayal by Alberto Mejia Baron who not surprisingly doesn t take kindly to any strangers trespassing on his terrain Director co writer Pedro Galindo III relates the gripping story at a steady pace creates a good deal of nerve rattling tension and delivers a fair amount of graphic gore with the brutal murder set pieces a nasty throat slicing and a hand being blown off with a shotgun rate as the definite gruesome splatter highlights The capable cast all give solid performances with especially praiseworthy work by Pedro Fernandez as the nice humane Nacho Edith Gonzalez as the feisty Alejandra Charly Valentino as the amiable Charly and Tono Mauri as antagonistic jerk Mauricio Better still both yummy blonde Marisol Santacruz and lovely brunette Adriana Vega supply some tasty eye candy by wearing skimpy bathing suits Antonio de Anda s slick agile cinematography the breathtaking sylvan scenery Pedro Plascencia s robust shuddery stirring score the well developed characters and the pleasingly tight n trim 76 minute running time further enhance the overall sound quality of this bang up horror action hybrid winner
I searched for this movie for years apparently it ain t available here in the States so bought me a copy off Ebay br br Four young hunters and three of their girlfriends venture into the woods searching for a bear that apparently has killed several campers What they find is an ex Vietnam vet gone crazy he kills some of his victims using a glove with long metal finger nails a la Freddy Krueger As soon as the night falls one of the girls goes for a walk after a brief argument with her boyfriend she gets killed After one of the group finds her body they all hide in their tents waiting for daylight Once the sun comes up all of them try and make it out but fall victim one by one br br Seven bodies not a lot of gore but a couple of good murders especially the girls deaths The guys get killed in somewhat bloodless ways blown up in car shot to death knife through head br br Overall INFERNAL TRAP is a nice slasher film from the late 80 s Nothing new just well acted fast paced and some pretty ladies 10 out of 10
Talk about a blast opening Trampa Infernal has the coolest opening credits ever Guided by musical tones that are perhaps slightly inspired by the legendary Friday the 13th theme Tsh Tsh Tsh Ha Ha Ha the names of the lead players appear on screen split up in giant syllables Promising intro of a totally obscure Mexican slasher backwoods survival thriller and it only becomes cooler with every minute that passes Two extremely competitive and testosterone overloaded paintball enemies challenge each other to the ultimate showdown in a sleazy bar According to a newspaper article there s a savage bear loose in the nearby woods and it already killed multiple of the hunters that tried to catch it The challenge includes that whoever kills the bear will be declared the ultimate macho hero with the biggest set of balls Upon arrival however it quickly becomes obvious they re not up against a bear but a bewildered and utterly maniacal war veteran with quite an arsenal of weapons in his hideout and numerous combat tricks up his sleeve After a whole decade of tame and derivative American slashers this early 90 s Mexican effort looks and feels very refreshing and vivid The formula is simplistic but efficient the lead characters are plausible enough and the building up towards the confrontations with the sadist killer is reasonably suspenseful The maniac must have been a fan of Freddy Krueger and Michael Myers as he also uses a self made glove with sharp knives attached to it and a white mask to cover his face The murders are pleasingly nasty and barbaric which I was really hoping for since the awesome aforementioned opening sequences and waste a whole lot of gratuitous blood The forestry setting and particularly the camouflaged booby traps are joyously spectacular Trampa Internal is a Mexican slasher survival sleeper hit that comes warmly recommended to the fans of the genre
Rumour has it that around the time that ABBA the multi award winning Swedish disco favourites s star had reached its zenith the band grew disillusioned with singing in English and yearned to perform in their native tongue Soon after problems began to emerge in the onetime wed locked watertight partnership and recordings became less and less frequent The band dissolved albeit unofficially in 1982 and pop lost one of its most celebrated artists Although they have never admitted that there s any truth in those rumours the fact remains that ABBA would never have been so successful had they only recorded in their native tongue If you want to appeal to the largest money making media market in the entire world then you must cater for English speaking audiences br br It s amazing for me how such a small island that s located a stone throw away from the European continent could have created perhaps the most recognised although not most widely spoken language in the world Everyone speaks a little bit of English whether it be simply hello or a common swear word you ll find an English speaker almost everywhere Pedro Galindo obviously didn t agree because Trampa Infernal was never subtitled for global consumption until it was released recently on budget DVD That s a real shame because it s actually a decent slasher movie that s a lot better than many of its English speaking genre compatriots br br The film launches in the somewhat unfamiliar territory of a pistol duel Two unidentified characters are shown sneaking around a dilapidated complex searching out one another for the inevitable final showdown After some suspense and a couple of near misses one of the pistoleers emerges victoriously Next we learn that they were only paintball guns and the two competitors are actually youngsters from the local town Nacho and Mauricio are fiercest rivals and Mauricio is always trying to prove himself to be better than his soft spoken opponent but as of yet he hasn t succeeded br br Later that night whilst the victorious gunslinger celebrates his triumph with his girlfriend Alejandra and his buddy Charly Mauricio enters the bar and says that he has one last challenge for his glorious nemesis He says that this will be the competition that will prove to the town once and for all who deserves the uttermost respect Nacho is at first reluctant because Alejandra warns him of the perils of continual competitiveness but he eventually succumbs to the weight of peer pressure and agrees much to the distaste of his morally superior partner br br They plan to head out to the remote region of Filo de Caballo because recent press coverage has reported that numerous people have been butchered by what locals believe to be a vicious bear Mauricio proposes that whoever murders the animal can be regarded as the greatest and he also promises that it will be the last battle that he wages against his adversary br br After visiting the armoury to stock up on weapons and ignoring the warnings of the elderly store keeper the group set out to the remoteness of the secluded woodland Hunters become hunted as they learn that the bear is actually a homicidal Vietnam vet who is still unaware that the war has ended and considers all humans as his enemy What started as a competitive adventure suddenly becomes a battle for survival as they are stalked and slaughtered by the malevolent assassin br br I picked up Trampa whilst studying in Madrid from a Mexican student who lived in the dorm room next door to me I remember that the copy I watched was faulty and the tape ended about 10 minutes before the final credits rolled which meant I never got to see the final scenes Thankfully I came across the budget DVD recently on Amazon and immediately added it to my collection br br Gallindo s slasher is a surprisingly good effort that excels from its skillful direction and enthusiastic plot which attempts to cover areas not usually approached by slasher movies It is in fact so good that it reminded me on more than one occasion of the Arnold Schwarzenegger classic Predator This is especially evident in the scenes that show the creepily masked assassin jogging through the forest and stalking the panic stricken troupe as they struggle to escape the maniac s playground br br Despite Gallindo s obvious awareness of genre platitudes the bogeyman even uses a claw fingered glove a la Freddy Kruegar Trampa also attempts to add something different to the standard template Whilst the majority of the runtime plays by the concrete rules of the category the final third heralds a significant step in individuality as the maniac arms himself with a machine gun and entices the hero to his lair for the final showdown From here on the film rapidly swaps genres and becomes almost an action film which depending on your taste will either excite or disappoint you The last slasher that tried to crossbreed the two styles was that shoddy eighties entry The Majorettes which is not necessarily a good thing br br As is the case with many Latin films especially Spanish flicks by Almodovar and Amenabar Trampa has a subtle undercurrent of a moral to its story which is conveyed successfully without being rammed down the viewer s throat Over indulge in the temptations of competitive masculinity and you may not always be the winner It s a sugar coated point but it s handled delicately enough not to detract from the fun of the feature br br Trampa may be cheesy but it deserves to be seen and recognised as one of the better late slashers The killer looks great in creepy army fatigues and white Valentine style mask and the attempts at originality just about work It may lack the gore that most sincere horror fans enjoy but it has enough in terms of suspense and creativity to warrant at least one viewing
I think it s one of the greatest movies which are ever made and I ve seen many The book is better but it s still a very good movie
All this talk about this being a bad movie is nonsense As a matter of fact this is the best movie I ve ever seen It s an excellent story and the actors in the movie are some of the best I would not give criticism to any of the actors That movie is the best and it will always stay that way
I never heard of the book nor care to read it but the movie I will probably see many times br br This film is unforgettable with perhaps the richest imagery I have ever seen in a movie It was as if I was looking at paintings many times which I think was the idea br br Terrific movie story actors and cinematography Full of profound emotions from every angle Although I am not particularly fond of romance movies I loved this and was deeply moved by Winona Ryder s plea to her father toward the end br br Mr Irons deserved an award for his performance and Close was never better br br
Can such an ambient production have failed its primary goal which was to correctly adapt Allende s novel Obviously yes Bille August managed to make a superficial shallow film where basic elements of South American mentality are presented simply as side events resulting in total incoherency I can t believe there was a whole production team that could not understand the book There is of course technical quality in this film and I think the actors did their best with what they had in their hands but something is missing And this something was the most important part
Perhaps the best Isabel Allende s book House of the Spirits describes an alternative chilean history this one full of magic a mystic veil plus some kind of omnipresent sadness This movie gathers a great cast plus a great art direction with a script that cannot contain all this book s quality It s unusual for a nearly unknown country like Chile to get so well represented as it is by this movie whose perhaps only sin is to aim too high and because of that left the illiterate public a little upset mostly because they understood very little
well i said it all in the summary i simpley adore the movie and the cast i would give each actor an Oscar great great movie i m 25 now and i watched it 4 times in different periods and i always think i won t cry and i always do about 2 or 3 times meryl s was absolutely brilliant jeremy irons also just brilliant i wish the movie received more awards i really don t know anybody who watched it and didn t loved it also glenn close was fantastic the story was beautiful and sad at the same time i loved the fact that despite everything clara and esteban loved each other so much and how blanca was close to her parents
Maybe it s because I saw the movie before reading the book but I really love this movie I ve seen it many many times and will be watching it many times more It s a compelling story that s interesting from the beginning to the end It has everything action romance etc
This is one of the few movies I watched twice in the theatre I really love this movie for its atmosphere and its telling of the life of tragic hero Esteban Trueba He makes so many mistakes but gets a chance for redemption Isn t this a rather consoling thought br br When I watched it for the first time I thought that after the won election the movie would be over I didn t know the book So boy was I wrong when the dramatic climax was still to come I was literally swept away by the sheer power of the last half hour of the film br br Many people here utterly dislike this movie I cannot understand that one single bit Maybe those who read the book first are as often with screen adaptations of novels simply disappointed that so many things have remained untold unseen unexplained But as a movie telling a touching story the story of a family the rise and fall of a man the deep compassion of a woman the strength of love and the insanity of hate and conservatism this movie is simply splendid Furthermore the soundtrack is incredibly good and the cast is wonderful as well especially Winona Ryder and Jeremy Irons br br So definitely one of those films that cinema was invented for
This movie is an incredible piece of work It explores every nook and cranny of the human mind focusing on the characters relationships with the people around them Stellar performances all around This one had me weeping for about half an hour straight Spend some real time with this one
At first I didn t didn t like it that much although I did They didn t include the third Trueba generation the love between Blanca and Pedro wans t well explained and some actors were too different from what I had imagined br br Later I realized that had the movie been more loyal to the book it would have been like five hours long and would be kind of tedious Now I like it very much because my favourite characters are there as I portraited them Clara really looks like an Angel in live and her introduction to the story at the beggining of the film was fantastic loyal and short Glenn Close is Ferula I pictured her just like that only not in mourning throughout the whole thing Esteban is find enough I never really liked his character and although I was interested in him I hated him a lot more specially when he hit Clara As in the book the very last part is the most exciting one and it has real history too there br br The movie is really good specially considering that it was a gringo film based upon a latin american book Its amazing how many famous stars are there don t you think so
The photography of this bid budget production is surprisingly bad Colors are muddy and brownish and the photography has very 80ish look to it Direction and editing are often quite uninspired and TV movie like too And at first the movie only seems to want to torture its viewers with lurid images of sex and violence Hans Zimmer s score is also a typically simple and bland work of this overrated untalented composer br br But if you are willing to watch the movie further you are rewarded with a very moving family story a sort of European version of Edna Ferber s family epos Giant While at first you wonder why Clara married this idiotic man even his character gets more depth and more background one can judge him by Clara delivers the movie s spiritual lesson a great and moving statement set against the terrible happenings in her country Her daughter whose lover is a young Antonio Banderas at the beginning of his international career understands that lesson and ultimately tries to live by it The way the plot was constructed with the ending mirroring the beginning was great The actors all do a great job too I was wondering Who is the actress playing Blanca all the time but of course it was a really young Winona Ryder br br All in all this movie really made me want to read the book
Could not understand why Jeremy Irons felt it necessary to exhibit a most disconcerting accent spoken through clenched teeth and from the back of his throat In fact it rather spoiled the film for me and distracted from what was probably a fine performance by him very irritating No other actor or actress seemed to have such a pronounced accent and whilst I have always rated Jeremy Irons as a fine actor I would not class this film as being one of his best The film however has whetted my appetite as have some of the other comments made re this film which I have found very interesting and intend to now read the book
Brilliant adaptation of the novel that made famous the relatives of Chilean President Salvador Allende killed In the environment of a large estate that arises from the ruins becoming a force to abuse and exploitation of outrage a luxury estate for the benefit of the upstart Esteban Trueba and his undeserved family the brilliant Danish director Bille August recreates in micro which at the time would be the process leading to the greatest infamy of his story to the hardened Chilean nation and whose main character would Augusto Pinochet Stephen similarities with it are inevitable recall as an example that image of the senator with dark glasses that makes him the wink to the general to begin making the palace br br Bille August attends an exceptional cast in the Jeremy protruding Irons whose character changes from arrogance and extreme cruelty the hard lesson that life always brings us to almost force us to change In Esteban fully applies the law of resonance with great wisdom Solomon describes in these words The things that freckles are the same punishment that will serve you br br Unforgettable Glenn Close playing splint the tainted sister of Stephen whose sin driven by loneliness spiritual and platonic love was the wife of his cruel snowy brother Meryl Streep also brilliant a woman whose name came to him like a glove Clara With telekinetic powers cognitive and mediumistic this hardened woman loyal to his blunt conservative husband is an indicator of character and self control that we wish for ourselves and for all human beings br br Every character is a portrait of virtuosity as Blanca worthy rebel leader Pedro Segundo unhappy or a portrait of humiliation like Stephen Jr the bastard child of Senator who serves as an instrument for the return of the boomerang br br The film moves the bowels we recreated some facts that should not ever be repeated but that absurdly still happen Colombia is a sad example and another reminder that against all life is wonderful because there are always people like Isabel Allende and immortalize just Bille August
I liked the movie first of all because it told an interesting story but the story as told in the movie felt like it was condensed from a much longer story Since the book is over 400 pages that makes sense It spans a time period from the 1920s to the 1970s in a fictional South American country also a lot to fit into the time available I think it would have been much better as a six hour mini series than it turned out as a 140 minute movie br br Even though it s rushed the story doesn t skip so much that it gets confusing What is told is told fairly well One fault is that Clara s supernatural powers appear inconsistently either they should have appeared more evenly through the course of the movie or they should have been left out Two more faults which could be spoilers Esteban s eventual return to goodness happens somewhat too suddenly and Ferula s curse seems to wear off even though the tone of the story suggests that it should endure forever br br The acting is excellent Glenn Close as the tormented spinster Ferula is outstanding Jeremy Irons as the brutal self made rich man is also excellent Meryl Streep as the main character Clara is great although she s often even better than she was in this movie There were many well performed smaller roles too The biggest fault is that the movie seemed to lack a dialect coach each actor seemed to speak in a different sort of accent
Although the story is fictional it draws from the reality of not only the history of latin american countries but all the third world This is the true pure and raw recent history of these countries summarized concisely in this novel film The offbeat supranatural stuff lightens up the intensity of historical events presented in this movie After all the supranatural stuff is a part of the culture in the third world Although is not critically acclaimed probably because of the supranatural stuff This is an excellent movie with a great story and great acting
The House of the Spirits is a gripping tale of family intrigue South American politics and super natural powers Meryl Streep Glenn Close and Jeremy Irons bring Isabel Allende s novel to life with all its passion and suspense This in my view is one of the best films of the 1990s Jeremy Irons as Esteban Trueba ages and mellows very believably while Meryl Streep in the role of Clara maintains her gentle loving warmth throughout her relatively short life Winona Ryder and Antonio Banderas make a handsome couple struggling for family acceptance in a racist culture Glenn Close as Esteban s sister gives a very moving performance The countryside of Portugal is a reasonable substitute for a non tropical Latin American country Settings of Clara s home and Esteban s ranch are effective and the period US cars add nicely to the post war atmosphere
Before all I d like to point out that I have not read the book so there was no chance I d be disappointed in that aspect The major flaw I spotted was historical detail with several cars trains clothes etc I think don t belong at that time br br Possible spoiler br br The technical aspect of the film is ok nothing to brag about But the acting I think was terrific I don t have no experience in acting still I can t believe how people can consider this terrible Maybe they ve only seen two movies ever and the other one must have been very good indeed br br I specially liked Jeremy Irons and really understood his character someone who crawled up the social ladder with very hard work then fights against those who would take his life s work from him only he gets so involved in this fight he doesn t realize reason is no longer at his side and he ends up a beaten disappointed man Irons made this so believable I sympathized with the character despite his brutality br br After Jeremy Irons Winona Ryder is also wonderful as a romantic young women who is drawn into the revolutionary ideals by her boyfriend Banderas he had an under developed part I think and Glenn Close was also very good Meryl Streep had an average performance it was not bad just not up to the standards of the other actors Watch out for Miguel Guilherme a fine Portuguese actor between so many stars br br In contrast to today s movies here only the interpretations only people matter but at the same time it is not a pretensious film too worried trying to be intellectual The best proof I really liked it I m writing a review 7 years later
Hotel Du Nord is a gripping drama of guilt in which Marcel Carne portrayed an entertaining tale of ill fated love which also functions as a revolt against the cruel world The film is based entirely on a pair of hapless lovers Pierre and Renee were mistaken when they believed that suicide would put an end to their misery Hotel Du Nord has its own inimitable charm as its inhabitants have become an essential part of the establishment There is an element of togetherness as everyone flocks to Hotel Du Nord to eat chat etc Marcel Carne has remained true to the spirit of the films produced in 30s and 40s as Hotel Du Nord has a certain kind of nostalgic feel Carne while recreating the life of Parisian roads was able to create a sort of nostalgia for black and white giving a unique genre of poetic realism to his oeuvre Hotel Du Nord can be termed as a quintessence of cinematographic populism The 14th July ball scene on the banks of Saint Martin canal remains a magnificent sequence The film s immense popularity can be judged from the fact that Hotel Du Nord has been declared as a national monument
A true classic Beautifully filmed and acted Reveals an area of Paris which is alive and filled with comedy and tragedy Although the area of Hotel du Nord and the Hotel itself still exists it is not as gay in the original sense of the word and joyful as it once must have been The film makes one yearn for the past which has been lost with a sigh and bittersweetness
I love this movie Jouvet Arletty Blier Carn√© almost everything has already been said about the movie but there is one detail I d like to shed some light onto no footage of the real still standing H√¥tel du Nord is it still I heard it was to be demolished has been used for the movie the whole scene has been rebuilt on set the main reason being that they could not stop the traffic on the St Martin canal for several weeks
This is an excellent film and is the sort of treasure that one can only catch through sporadic cinema showings as it is unavailable on video DVD The way that the film begins with the two lovers arriving and ends with them leaving although quite a lot happens in between and they don t stay in one place during this time gives you a sense of closure and a feeling that all is right with the world If you get a chance to see this film then do I can t wait to see it again and wish that it could be put on general release
I suppose I always felt that Hotel du Nord was studio bound the movement of people cars and camera were just too effortlessly smooth and stagey to have been filmed on location But no problem it s still a much underrated lovely composition from Marcel Carne The plot seems a bit choppy at times as if they were making it up as they went along but because it is unpredictable holds the attention to the bitter end The money shots when the 2 lovers are alone in their room are saddled with some rather stilted dialogue but it s all so lovely to fall into any inanity can be accepted Are these 2 young people symbols of a cancerous hopelessness in pre War France or simply idiots Suicide pacts are fairly common if the suicidees are young and healthy with their lives before them untrammelled would you think anything other than that they were just misguided fools br br Arletty played the part of prostitute well she kept that zipper on her dress busy throughout anyway I ve only seen a few films with Jouvet he is the most impressive invention as pimp in HDN my trouble is shallow every time I see his face I think of Sonnie Hale in Evergreen br br A remarkably atmospheric well acted and photographed film with so much happening it needs a few viewings to get it all in place Annabella and Aumont made an exceptionally beautiful couple Francois Heurtebise Perier in his 2nd film had a small amusing part as a gay man All in all wonderful
Hotel du Nord is the only Carn√© movie from the 1936 1946 era which has dialogs not written by Jacques Pr√©vert but by Henri Jeanson Janson was much more interested in the Jouvet Arletty couple than in the pair of lovers Annabella Aumont The latter is rather bland and their story recalls oddly the Edith Piaf s song les amants d un jour except that the chanteuse s tale is a tragic one What s fascinating today is this popular little world the canal Saint Martin settings br br This movie is dear to the French movies buffs for another very special reason The pimp Jouvet tells his prot√©g√©e Raymonde he wants a change of air atmosph√®re Because she does not understand the meaning of the world atmosph√®re the whore Raymonde wonderful Arletty thinks it s an insult and she delivers this line that is undeniably the most famous of the whole French cin√©ma br br In French Atmosph√®re Atmosph√®re Est ce que j ai une gueule d atmosph√®re Translation attempt Atmosphere atmosphere Have I got an atmosphere face This is our French Nobody s perfect
Fragile Carne just before his great period Although it is sometimes hesitantly directed and marred by longueurs HOTEL DU NORD is full of the faded charm and beauty typical of French films of the late 1930s as well as a relative lightness of touch unusual with this director All of his great virtues are here the cramped interiors broken up by gliding complex delicious camera movements a melancholy deployment of light and shade remarkable wistful sets by Alexander Trauner which are so evocative that they as the title suggests take on a shaping personality of their own the quietly mournful music of Maurice Jaubert a seemingly casual plot about romance tragedy and fatalism that casts a noose over its characters extraordinary performances by some of the greatest players of all time in this case Louis Jouvet and Arletty br br In fact the film s biggest failing and I find myself astonished as someone who usually didactically minimises its importance to admit it is its script It has plenty of wit and poignancy but without the poetry and irony regular Carne collaborator Jacques Prevert brought to their best films it cannot avoid slipping into cliche even if it is only cliche in hindsight br br Ostensibly set in the boarding house the film sets up its opening idea of community with two interconnecting tales of doomed love and emotional metaphysical and actual isolation The doomed love scenario is the one that works least well Annabella is very beautiful but not very good at doing tragic while Aumont s callowness brilliantly appropriate though it may be by its nature obtrudes any real felt romance Maybe it s just me but I find it hard to sympathise with a couple so young so attractive who after only a few months are so racked with despair that they have to shoot each other Their high flown lines are rather embarrassing too Of course this affair is not meant to be plausible they are symbolic of youth hope and possibility being crushed in France or maybe France itself despairing resigned waiting for death For symbols to be truly powerful they must convince on a narrative level which I feel they don t quite here br br What saves this plot is its connection with the story of M Edmond a character linked to the great tradition of French gangsters Although we only learn it gradually he is a killer in hiding living off the prostitute played by Arletty having dobbed in his accomplices In his previous role and the theatricality of his position is crucial he had one set of traits in hiding he has assumed their complete opposite Living a rather aimless life he is profoundly shaken by the lovers pact and becomes fatalistic realising the folly of trying to cheat death br br In this way the admission that one is less a person than a collection of signs and that death is an unavoidable reality the most powerful masculinity must succumb to Edmond is like a romantic prototype of Melville s clinical killers With one exception he gives briefly into hope a delusion which only strenghtens if that s not too much of an unbearable irony his fatal resolve br br All this could have been trite if it wasn t for the truly amazing performance of Louis Jouvet I had studied his theatrical work at college but this was my first taste of his screen talents and he reveals himself to be worthy of the greats Grant Mastroianni Clift Mason Mitchum Cotten giving a quiet nobility to a role which is more of a conception he needless to say is allegorical too than an actual person Edmond begins the film a minor supporting character but emerges as a tragic hero of some force Like all those major actors Jouvet s brilliance lies in what he conceals br br On a formal level what amazes is Carne s grasping ten years before its flourishing of the techniques of the great Hollywood melodramas of Sirk Ophuls Ray and Minnelli Although his theatricality lacks the fluidity and clear eyed beauty of Sierck s contemporary German melodramas check out the masterpieces ZU NEUEN UFERN and LA HABENERA Carne s style truly fits his theme that of entrapment paralysis resignation br br The film s principle motif is that of water the credits float and dissolve the hotel stands by a waterway but instead of Renoir s open river of possibility we have a canal stagnant and manmade going nowhere The film begins as it ends and the setting never changes except for one brief interlude from which both escapees are doomed to return Characters can only escape through death their entrapment is emphasised by the narrow rooms they occupy the walls and frames that hold them captive the windows that look out on an escape they can never achieve Any hope at the end therefore is profoundly if romantically compromised
Anna Christie 1931 br br On its own terms this version of Garbo s Anna Christie shot a year later in German with a whole new cast is just toned down and refined enough to work better than the English version both are American MGM productions Garbo is if anything more commanding or more beautiful as a screen presence and her acting is more restrained And she seems frankly more at ease probably for a lot of reasons but we can speculate that she was no longer making her first talking picture so had adjusted quickly br br Without comparing always one film to the other this Anna Christie is still the same O Neill play with too many words His themes of a woman wanting love without losing her independence are here but it comes off as oddly old fashioned anyway There are some scenes missing the Coney Island section is shortened and isn t as good but overall it s a direct echo of the first film The director Jacques Feyder Belgian French is simply redoing what was done already which I assume must be a frustrating experience br br It s interesting to see both films in succession because they are blocked out exactly the same way not only the sets but the shots are all the same There is an occasional scene lifted from the earlier film some of the storm understandably but also a brief scene where Marie Dressler from the English language version is walking with her friend on a plank over a canal drunk as can be But they are just silhouettes and when the next scene shows their faces we see the German actors taking their parts There is no replacing Dressler for sure but for me the German father is more believable and honest in his performance br br Clearly the themes immigration wayward fathers daughters turning to prostitution and the troubles of finding true love have strong currents back then especially with European threads Garbo appropriately plays a Swedish young woman
After Garbo s introduction to sound in Clarence Brown s Anna Christie Jacques Feyder made a German version of the movie where all of the cast except for Garbo were different While the American version is still more available in the USA and most of the American viewers have primarily seen this version the Germna Anna Christie is more likely to be viewed in Europe As I have seen both films I feel the right to compare the two closely knit productions Is Jacques Feyder s film different Is it better than Clarence Brown s br br In this analysis I would like to focus first on what the both movies have in common They have identical sets very similar scripts and the same chronologically presented scenes Here you also find the story of the young woman who comes back to her father after years of absence and is trying to start a new life Here you also have the humorous though a bit shorter sequence in the amusement park However when emphasizing Garbo herself I address the first difference She does not appear to cause such a curiosity while talking The viewer concentrates more on her acting than on the way she speaks which occurred most probably to 1931 viewers Garbo was very good in American film and she is also very good here Yet to me she seems even more genuine in the German version It is noticeable that Garbo does not focus on the way she says the words that much the effort that was artificially created by the sensation GARBO TALKS Her German is not very well pronounced yet no one cares everything is perfectly understood Therefore I can easily say the same I did in my American version comment Skaal Greta Garbo br br Yet the film differs in one very important issue the rest of the cast Here comes the question which portrayal seems more captivating which one is better for sure The differences are filled with varieties Salka Viertel or Salka Steuerman Garbo s lifelong friend does not do the equally great job as Marie Dressler in the role of Marthy Owens She is not bad she is different sometimes overacts from today s perspective but is no longer that genuine in the role as Marie Dressler who still amuses us and whose moments have absolutely stood a test of time Some people even claim that Dressler was better than Garbo in the film and that opinion though appears to be questionable of course carries some truth Theo Shall is more sympathetic as Matt than Charles Bickford but when applied to him this is not the matter of performance so much as the mater of looks br br Who shines in the German Anna Christie who is really worth greatest attention is Hans Junkermann in the role of Chris Christopherson Anna s father George F Marion vs Hans Junkermann is like a day vs night difference Junkermann portrays a real alcohol addict a man with hopes with fears who overdoes the care of his daughter The scene of Anna s first meeting with her father is truly magnificent the opening moment of Chris conversation with Marthy is memorable particularly thanks to his facial expressions and a flawless performance Junkermann is the Chris whom you like who you sometimes laugh at whom you sympathize with who leaves a picture of a calm alcoholic sailor in your mind Great br br If you have seen the American Anna Christie and have a chance to get the German version I would highly recommend to you this movie because it s a slightly different look at the story a nice and accurate way to compare a fine enrichment to Clarence Brown s movie and foremost a wonderful chance to discover a marvel of performance Hans Junkermann s Skaal or Prost Hans Junkermann
Filmed by MGM on the same sets as the English version but in German Garbo s second portrayal of Anna Christie benefited from practice and her apparent ease with German dialog Garbo appears more relaxed and natural under Jacques Feyder s direction than under Clarence Brown s and her silent movie mannerisms have all but disappeared which made her transition to sound complete The strength she brought to the character remains here although it has been softened and Garbo reveals more of Anna s vulnerability The entire cast with the exception of Garbo is different from the previous version of the film and Garbo benefits from not having to compete with Marie Dressler who stole every scene she was in during the English language version In Feyder s film Garbo holds the center of attention throughout although the three supporting players particularly the father gave excellent performances br br Feyder s direction was more assured than Clarence Brown s and his use of the camera and editing techniques did not seem as constrained by the new sound process as did those of Brown The film moves with more fluidity than the English language adaptation and the static nature of the first film has been replaced with a flow that maintains viewer interest Even William Daniels cinematography seems improved over his filming of the Brown version He captured Garbo s luminescence and the atmospherics of the docks with style Also the screenplay adaptation for the European audience made Anna s profession quite clear from the start and the explicitness clarifies for viewers who were unfamiliar with the play as to what was only implied in the Brown filming However the film was made before the Production Code was introduced which made the censorship puzzling br br Garbo s Oscar nomination for Anna Christie was always somewhat mystifying and I suspected that the nod was given more in recognition of her relatively smooth transition to sound films than for her performance However some of the Academy voters may have seen the German language version of the film and they realized as will contemporary viewers that her Anna Christie under Feyder s direction was definitely Oscar worthy
This version of Anna Christie is in German Greta Garbo again plays Anna Christie but all of the other characters have different actors from the English version Both were filmed back to back because Garbo had such a following in Germany Garbo herself supposedly favored her Anna Christie in this version over the English version It s a good tale and a must see for Garbo fans
It s sort of crazy but I taped from TCM both this german version of MGM s Anna Christie and the english one but I got to see this one first cos I d heard that many people thought it was better than the english version br br Without having seen the other one I cannot compare them but anyway this is an excellent early talkie with a straight from the heart performance by Garbo She looks very beautiful in this film her face shines throughout especially when Cameraman William Daniels gets those gorgeous close ups of her br br The atmosphere of the film seems different from the regular MGM stuff made on that era it looks very similar to french or german expressionistic films from the thirties well it was directed by a great french director Monsieur Jacques Feyder who had directed Garbo in 1929 in The Kiss br br Theo Shall is excellent and gives an absolutelly believable performance as Anna s sweetheart the hard boiled tough sailor who s just a kid in man s body Also Hans Junkermann gives a very fine performance as Anna s alcoholic father and Salka Viertel too as a good hearted old cheap floozie br br In all quite an experience because it s the only film were you can listen to Garbo speak in a foreign language cos all the other films she did in either Sweden or Germany were during the Silent Era br br Serious Flick
Master director Ching Siu Tung s perhaps most popular achievement is this series A Chinese Ghost Story 1 3 Chinese Ghost Story stars Leslie Cheung in some distant past in China as a tax collector who is forced to spend a night during his collecting trip in a mysterious castle in which some strange old warriors fight and meet him Beautiful actress Joey Wang Wong is the ghost who lives in that castle and is under a domination of one powerful demon a wood devil who collects human souls for herself itself with the help of her beautiful ghosts Leslie and Joey fall in love and even though ghosts are not allowed to live with humans they decide to break that rule and live happily together for the rest of their lives This is not what the wood devil thinks and our protagonists have to fight for their lives and their happiness br br This film is no less full of magic than other films by Ching Siu Tung His masterpieces include Duel to the Death 1983 and the Swordsman series which all have incredible visuals and kinetic power in their action scenes Ghost Story is full of brilliant lightning and dark atmosphere which is lightened by the strong presence of the beautiful and good willing ghost The effects are simply breath taking and would work at their greatest power in the big screen The camera is moving and twisted all the time and it adds to the fairy tale atmosphere this film has There s plenty of wire fu stunts too and even though some think they are and look gratuitous or stupid when used in films I cannot agree and think they give motion pictures the kind of magic freedom and creativeness any other tool could not give When people fly in these films it means the films are not just about our world and they usually depict things larger than life with the power of this larger than life art form br br The story about the power of love is pretty touching and warm but the problem is again that the characters are little too shallow and act unexplainably occasionally Leslie and Joey should have been written with greater care and their characters should be even more warm deep and genuine in order to give the story a greater power and thus make the film even more noteworthy and important achievement Also the message about love and power of it is underlined little too much at one point and it should have been left just to the viewer s mind to be interpreted and found Another negative point about the dialogue is that it s too plenty and people talk in this film without a reason That is very irritating and sadly shows the flaws many scriptwriters tend to do when they write their movies People just talk and talk and it s all there just to make everything as easy to understand as possible and so the film is not too challenging or believable as it has this gratuitous element Just think about the films of the Japanese film maker Takeshi Kitano his films have very little dialogue and all there is is all the necessary as he tells his things by other tools of cinema and never talks or makes other characters talk too much in his movies This is just the talent the writers should have in order to write greater scripts br br Otherwise Chinese Ghost Story is very beautiful and visually breath taking piece of Eastern cinema and also the song that is played in the film is very beautiful and hopefully earned some award in the Hong Kong film awards back then I give Chinese Ghost Story 7 10 and without the flaws mentioned above this would without a doubt be almost perfect masterpiece of the fantasy genre
I can t remember many films where a bumbling idiot of a hero was so funny throughout Leslie Cheung is such the antithesis of a hero that he s too dense to be seduced by a gorgeous vampire I had the good luck to see it on a big screen and to find a video to watch again and again 9 10
this is a great movie i like it where ning climbs down to get his ink and the skeletons chase him but luckily he dodged them opened the window and didn t even notice them xiao qian is very pretty too when he stuck the needle up ma Wu s butt its hysterical and when he is saying love is the greatest thing on earth while standing between two swords is great too then also the part where he eats his buns while watching thew guy kill many people then you see him chanting poems as he ran to escape the wolves the love scenes are romantic xiao qian and ning look cute together add the comic timing the giant tongue and u have horror romance comedy all at once not to mention superb special effects for the 90s
Wasn t quite sure what to expect with this one outside of the uniform positive reviews I ve read Turns out I could have never imagined this movie because it s very close to The Bride with White Hair in being operatic and dealing with the fantastic This walks a fine line between being a farce a comedy and just plain good old fashion ghost story telling There s nothing scary about it that s not the theme it s really mostly a love story dealing with a bumbling guy who encounters a beautiful ghost who is in a lot of trouble with other ghosts So the main theme is the guy trying to save the beautiful ghost This also takes place in ancient China with wild outlandish Kung Fu exhibitions and a trip to hell more or less Some of the stop action ghosts are pretty cool and the visual effects are top rate all the way I could watch this genre of Chinese movies all day because they are highly entertaining great visuals and pretty much tongue in cheek And I m looking forward to watching the first sequel of this movie also Highly recommended
A Chinese Ghost Story stars the late great Leslie Cheung as Ling Choi Sin a penniless tax collector who decides to spend the night at a deserted temple where he meets and falls for a beautiful woman called Tsing Joey Wang When Ling discovers that Tsing is actually a ghost who has been forced to seduce victims for an evil tree spirit who feeds on chi life force he decides to try and free the girl by giving her remains a proper burial Enlisting the help of Swordsman Yin Wu ma a crazy Taoist monk Ling successfully defeats the tree spirit but must also do battle in hell against the evil Lord Black to whom Tsing is due to be wed br br The first Hong Kong film that I saw which wasn t purely martial arts action A Chinese Ghost Story opened my eyes to the incredible world of Asian fantasy horror a magical realm inhabited by beautiful female ghosts bumbling innocent heroes sword wielding Taoist monks monstrous spirits and dark lords of the underworld I instantly fell in love with the film s exuberance energy humour inventiveness and visual excellence br br Two decades later and this amazing movie still remains one of the finest examples of its genre that I have seen a sumptuous breathtaking masterpiece that brilliantly blends horror comedy fantasy and romance With superb direction from Siu Tung Ching excellent editing from David Wu stunning cinematography and a whole slew of imaginative special effects including a humongous killer tongue a many tentacled monster and multiple flying heads A Chinese Ghost Story is a completely unforgettable and thoroughly enjoyable experience from start to finish
If there is a movie to be called perfect then this is it So bad it wasn t intended to be that way But superb anyway Go find it somewhere Whatever you do Do not miss it
There s never a dull moment in this movie Wonderful visuals good actors and a classical story of the fight of good and evil Mostly very funny sometimes even scary A true classic a movie everybody should see
A mix of comedy romance music action and horror A knockout This is one of the reasons people rave about Hong Kong cinema If you re looking for something totally original look no further Entertainment at it s peak
Just read the original story which is written by Pu in 18th century Strikingly the movie despict the original spirit very well though the plot was modified tremendously The film language the rhythm the special effect are all from hollywood but still there is a chinese core It is amazing how Hark Tsui managed to combine them together The result is pure beauty
Chinese Ghost Story is one of the most amazing Hong Kong films I have ever seen It s a brilliant mix of fantasy comedy romance horror and martial arts The film has some wonderful visuals and amazing fights I love especially the fight scene between Wu Ma and the tree demon tongue Truly original and refreshing film and another Embalmer s fine recommendation
Cannot believe a movie that can be made that good in 1987 and is virtually unknown in the west Not to repeat other reviews here The score is very good and moving Literally it means Dawn please never comes when it comes the beautiful ghost and the lover will be apart forever After 24 years Joel and Leslie still look great I enjoyed Joel in God of Gamblers and many movies by Leslie including Better Tomorrow
For long time I haven t seen such a good fantasy movie magic fights here are even better than in LOTR even considering that it s a 1987 movie and haven t computer special effects This movie have good plot good acting and interesting ideas Recommend everybody to see it
Once in a while a film comes along that raises the bar for every other film in its genre A film of this caliber will influence many films following its release for years to come A Chinese Ghost Story falls in this category It is arguably one of the best horror films made during the 1980 s possibly one of the best ever made br br The filmmakers have crafted a movie that appeals to every horror fan The story is engrossing and original The villains are appropriately menacing and frightening The sets are creepy and atmospheric There is even a little blood and gore to satisfy the splatter fan of the house But don t let the horror label scare you off if you re not a fan of the genre This film easily fits into many different categories br br The screenwriter has deftly blended the drama comedy horror kung fu and romance genres into a delicious deluxe cinematic pizza A Chinese Ghost Story is a beautiful epic love story told thankfully without the gratuitous nudity and or explicit sex scenes that have ruined many Hollywood love stories Those put off by the romantic elements of the story can sit back and revel in the fast paced swordplay and wire fu If that s not enough actors Leslie Cheung and Wu Ma provide enough humorous situations to satiate your appetite for comedy This film offers something for every film fan br br Director Siu Tung Ching and Producer Tsui Hark assembled a truly amazing cast for this film Leslie Cheung proves that he is not only a gifted actor but also a talented singer and a charming physical comedian I cannot possibly think of a performer other than Cheung who could have portrayed Ling Choi Sin better except maybe Chow Yun Fat Joey Wang is enchanting as Lit Su Seen the enslaved spirit who steals the heart of Cheung s character Her portrayal of the title character is truly haunting and memorable Wu Ma is hilarious as the cantankerous Taoist who aids the young lovers br br On technical level this film is very impressive even by today s standards The direction is superb I wish that today s Hollywood executives would seek out talented artists like Siu Tung Ching rather falling back on the usual MTV video or Pepsi commercial directors The cinematography is gorgeous You have to commend any cinematographer who can make a film look good when most of its pivotal scenes take place in the dead of night The special effects make up is top notch In fact most of the creature effects in this film blow away the shoddy CGI ghouls and goblins that have become commonplace in modern horror films br br Since its release A Chinese Ghost Story has spawned two worthy sequels a full length animated movie and countless imitations None of the films that followed it or copied it were able to capture the magic of this classic however This film is required viewing for any horror fan or just anyone looking for great way to spend 95 minutes of your time 10 out 10 br br
There are 21 comments as I add mine to this list and there is barely a criticism This is because this film is terrific entertainment and has a bit of everything in it br br It is perhaps a little frightening for younger children but my 15 year old son thought it was fantastic in every way from the action to the humour and even to the beautiful music score br br I buy DVDs only when I know that they are going to be regularly watched and now that this is finally available in the UK I will certainly be adding it to my collection
Ching Siu Tung s and Tsui Hark s A Chinese Ghost Story aside from being one of the greatest wuxia pian films ever made is a beautiful and romantic love story as well as an impressively choreographed martial arts film that should belong in every film lover s collection The sorely missed Hong Kong superstar Leslie Cheung plays a traveling tax collector who spends the night at a haunted temple While staying at the temple he meets a colorful cast of characters that include the swordsmen Yin Wu Ma and Hsiao Hou the Tree Devil and the beautiful ghost Lit Sin Seen played by the lovely Joey Wong br br To free her from the clutches of the evil Tree Devil he must reincarnate her body and travel to the underworld to defeat an even more powerful demon br br Enough good things can t be said about this film The pacing is perfect with a great combination of romance action fantasy and humor and the feverishly paced finale should leave you with little chance to breathe The chemistry between the wonderfully tragic Joey Wong and Leslie Cheung whose legendary career ended much too soon really allows the viewer to feel for both of them Indeed the acting on the whole is so vivacious and full of life I would say this is one of the most fun viewing experiences I ve ever had Much of the credit goes to Wu Ma in his portrayal of the mysterious Swordsman Yin His over the top persona of a disillusioned swordsman hell bent on vanquishing evil leads to some great moments of humor and traditional HK drama A wonderful score lush cinematography with eye popping colors and frenetic action pieces courtesy of Ching Siu Tung round out this wonderful film Find a copy anywhere you can 10 10
A masterpiece of comedy a masterpiece of horror a masterpiece of romance if there is anything negative to say about A Chinese Ghost Story it might be that the special effects looked dated in comparison to modern technology The film has a simple premise a poor debt collector has to stay in a secluded area while trying to collect a debt Of course it happens to be haunted as well br br What I wasn t expecting the first time I saw this film is that it s one of the most touching love stories I ve ever seen that is without losing any of the slapstick comedy that will have you in stitches Unlike some films of Asian cinema A Chinese Ghost Story isn t hard to swallow for those that aren t versed in Chinese culture Indeed it plays on timeless cultureless themes of the paranormal and romance br br Think Evil Dead 2 if they had thrown a wonderful love story into the mix This film is for real despite being overlooked by many It s absolutely among the best I ve ever seen It s ability to combine the best aspects of multiple genres and cross cultural boundaries in order to appeal to humanity everywhere is nothing short of fantastic Highly recommended 10 10
Though I m not the biggest fan of wirework based martial arts films when a film goes straight for fantasy rather than fighting I get a lot more fun out of it and this film is one of the best in terms of fantastical plotting and crazy flying shenanigans Ching Siu Tung has crafted here an enchanting treat with fine performance and much ethereal beauty The great tragic Leslie Cheung plays a tax collector hero who stays the night in a haunted temple and gets involved with a stunning fox spirit and a wacky Taoist Cheungs performance is filled with naive but dignified charm and Wu Ma is pleasingly off the wall as the Taoist monk who shows off some swordplay and even gets a musical number Perhaps best off all is Joey Wang as the fox spirit truly a delight to behold with every movement and gesture entrancingly seductive The film takes in elements of fantasy horror comedy and romance all stirred together into a constantly entertaining package Ching Siu Tung directing and handling the choreography gives some neat wirework thrills and fills the film with mists shadows and eerily enthralling benighted forest colours giving every forest scene a wonderfully bewitching atmosphere Also notable are the elaborate hair stylings and gorgeous flowing garments of the female characters with if I m not mistaken Joey Wang sporting hair done up like fox ears at times a marvellous touch Though the film features relatively little action and some perhaps ill advised cheesy pop songs at times this is a beautiful piece of entertainment with swell characters and plotting even the odd neat character arc a near constant supply of visual treats and copious dreamy atmosphere An ethereal treasure highly recommended
First things first the female lead is too gorgeous to be missed Now actress Wang Zu Xian the one who played Xiao Qian in the movie is 42 years old and well aged It s always good to review these glorious times when seeing old school HongKong productions like this br br The movie is one of the most influential titles made in 1980s The art set decoration and other aesthetic facets are all mesmerizing More fantastically the movie had a total black humorous undertone in it It feels like a horror movie but ultimately it s not scaring but only fun br br I had the experience of translating the second script of A Chinese Ghotst Story and I thought that script was a decent write However when I saw the movie I firstly was disappointed in seeing the movie different from the script like in a smaller scale and involving more comic roles However it turned out to be better executed in terms of being entertaining br br If you have seen the Lord of the Rings you will notice the similarities in this movie to LOTR The climax is like a mirror of Miranda Otto fighting with the Ring Witch It s definitely a laugh out loud Bravo
Sinnui yauman is without a doubt one of the best ghost stories ever made into film Written by Songling Pu and directed by Siu Tung Ching A Chinese Ghost Story has it all Ling Choi Sin played by Leslie Cheung is a young man down on his luck who goes in search of a monastery for lodging deep in the woods a place the villagers seem very afraid to go near The trek alone is perilous with wolves and a crazy taoist monk lives at the temple br br Ling Choi Sin meets Tsing a beautiful and mysterious young girl who also lives nearby in a deserted temple She is forced to seduce men for her evil mistress but when she meets innocent Ling Choi Sin they fall in love br br Ling Choi Sin is sort of a bumbling fool but his heart is in the right place while Tsing tries to protect him from the other spirits in the woods he tries to protect her from the monk who is trying to kill the spirits in the woods There s great martial arts even a monk that breaks out into drunken song as he performs ritual taoist sword forms The movie does a lot of traditional old martial art films acrobatics with magic and flying through the air leaping from tree to tree with elegant long gowns and scarves but the movie genuinely flows and everything is effective br br Tsing is to be married to a evil tree monster which cant be good and we feel her plight in her home where we meet her sisters and stepmother who is truly not nice br br In the end they must fight a tree witch with a deadly tongue and go with Yin deep into the heart of hell to fight a thousand year old evil to save their souls and bring Ling s ashes back to her home for a proper burial so she may have a chance at reincarnation br br A beautiful story that truly pays attention to details One is touched in many ways by this movie you ll laugh cry and just have fun with the great martial arts and cinematography And though at the end Yin and Ling Choi Sin ride off into the morning sun under a enchanting rainbow we never know if Tsing was afforded a reincarnation but we do know her
I saw this movie in my childhood And after 10 years I did not remember anything about this movie but I found out it I also don t know how I was able to find out this movie Its my life My all times favorite movie My words will fall short of true meaning what I have inside for this movie I follow this movie It s a brilliant mix of fantasy comedy romance horror erotic scary and martial arts The story about the power of love is pretty touching and warm It s a masterpiece of Hong Kong Cinema br br Sinnui Yauman is without a doubt one of the best ghost stories ever made into film Written by Songling Pu and directed by Siu Tung Ching A Chinese Ghost Story has it all Ling Choi Sin played by Leslie Cheung is a young man down on his luck who goes in search of a monastery for lodging deep in the woods a place the villagers seem very afraid to go near The trek alone is perilous with wolves and a crazy taoist monk lives at the temple br br Ling Choi Sin meets Tsing a beautiful and mysterious young girl who also lives nearby in a deserted temple She is forced to seduce men for her evil mistress but when she meets innocent Ling Choi Sin they fall in love br br Ling Choi Sin is sort of a bumbling fool but his heart is in the right place while Tsing tries to protect him from the other spirits in the woods he tries to protect her from the monk who is trying to kill the spirits in the woods There s great martial arts even a monk that breaks out into drunken song as he performs ritual taoist sword forms The movie does a lot of traditional old martial art films acrobatics with magic and flying through the air leaping from tree to tree with elegant long gowns and scarves but the movie genuinely flows and everything is effective br br Tsing is to be married to a evil tree monster which cant be good and we feel her plight in her home where we meet her sisters and stepmother who is truly not nice br br In the end they must fight a tree witch with a deadly tongue and go with Yin deep into the heart of hell to fight a thousand year old evil to save their souls and bring Ling s ashes back to her home for a proper burial so she may have a chance at reincarnation br br A beautiful story that truly pays attention to details One is touched in many ways by this movie you ll laugh cry and just have fun with the great martial arts and cinematography And though at the end Yin and Ling Choi Sin ride off into the morning sun under a enchanting rainbow we never know if Tsing was afforded a reincarnation but we do know her
This movie is one of my favourites It is a genre mixture with ingredients of the Action Horror Romantic Comedygenre Some of the special effects may seem outdated compared to modern standards This minor flaw is easily ignored There is so much to discover in this story The romantic relation between the two main characters is so beautiful that it hurts The visuals are beautiful too The action is great which is no surprise it is originating from Honkong birthplace of the world s best action movies The humour sometimes seems a little bit silly but in a good way Somehow this movie is being able to balance the different moods and keeps being good Absolutely recommended
This is the best Chinese movie I have ever seen and in my opinion a lot better than Hero or Chrouching Tiger Hidden Dragon The movie is a unique combination of several genres It s a beautiful love story action movie comedy and horror at the same time And the most amazing thing is that it really succeeds in all of this br br This movie definitely makes it to my top 5 and should be enjoyable to every movie lover The action sequences do have the traditional unrealistic jumping and even flying but the way it s shot differs from the style of Hero a lot and the flying always looks great and usually even makes sense ghosts can fly br br See this movie you won t regret it 10 10
This movie is incredible With great characters specially the old swordsman that can fly in the shape of fireball and jump across the trees this film tells a classic story of battle between good and forces of evil The final showdown is specially breathtaking and the music score is kinda cool br br Very very recommendable Not for the smallest children though This one deserves a 10
I first saw this film when it was transmitted around 1988 by the BBC when I was working on UK s 2000AD My pal Steve Parkhouse recorded it on VHS and sent it to me Up till this point I d really only seen the Shaw Bros kung fu movies with their harsh lighting so audience could see the moves clearly so it was a revelation to me to see something that looked like it had been lit by Ridley Scott coming out of Hong Kong This was also my first exposure to the movies of Tsui Hark pronounced apparently Choy Huk br br Yet for all the smoky back lit exteriors and ambitious special effects Stop motion In a Hong Kong Movie at the heart of Chinese GHOST STORY lies a simple and moving love story made all the more real by the outstanding acting talent of Leslie Cheung what a tragic tragic waste of a life and the beauty and elegance of Joey Wong Granted Joey is gorgeous but it s her balletic hand gestures that give her character an unattainable eroticism that s hard to analyse And though Joey is now almost 20 years older gawd which of us isn t this will always be the enduring image of that actress br br Some reviewers here have said that the film is simplistic and lacks any surprises but they re missing the fact that this movie was based on a famous Chinese story written by Pu Songling around 1700 That s a bit like complaining that Romeo and Juliet has a predictable ending and just copies WEST SIDE STORY Just wanted to get that off my chest br br For me Chinese GHOST STORY is the quintessential romantic tale It has high tragedy because we know that Chio Sin and Sin Seen can never be together It s about becoming mature for none of us can mature until we ve experienced great loss It s about sacrifice for sacrifice is an essential component of True Love And the comedy stylings of Wu Ma don t hurt a bit either br br Enjoy Chinese GHOST STORY by trying not to view it through a filter of Western culture and you ll get on with it just fine
I saw this movie first on the Berlin Film Festival and I had never seen Hong Kong cinema before I felt like sitting in a roller coaster the action was so quick and there wasn t one boring moment throughout the film It has martial arts love special effects and a fantastic plot My favorite scene is when the Taoist drinks sings and fights for himself one of the many scenes which stress the extraordinary musical component of the movie This film is a definite must
By 1987 Hong Kong had given the world such films as Sammo Hung s Encounters of the Spooky Kind Chow Yun Fat in John Woo s iconic A Better Tomorrow Zu Warriors and the classic Mr Vampire Jackie Chan was having international success on video but it was with A Chinese Ghost Story that HK cinema had its first real crossover theatrical hit in the West for many years br br Western filmgoers had never seen anything like it It was a film that took various ingredients that HK cinema had used for years flying swordsman wildly choreographed martial arts and the supernatural and blended them to create a film that was unique in its look feel and execution Forget the poor and unnecessary sequels it spawned this is the original and best br br Director Siu Tung Ching still best known as an Action Choreographer on such films as Woo s A Better Tomorrow 2 The Killer has under the watchful eye of legendary Producer Tsui Hark created a masterpiece of Fantasy Horror cinema And with such an expert crew at his disposal no less than 6 Martial Arts Coordinators the chances of the film being anything but wonderful would be unthinkable br br The editing by the amazingly prolific David Wu who wrote directed The Bride With White Hair 2 and edited such classic titles as A Better Tomorrow 1 2 3 Hardboiled and the cult hit The Club is quite simply a work of genius His crafting of the perfectly choreographed high flying tree climbing sword fights makes them some of the best HK cinema has ever created Fast moving outlandish but never confusing they are even today the pinnacle of their art br br The crew of cinematographers have also done miracles This is a film where every shot is an expertly crafted painting Where wonderful blue tinged night sequences shrouded in an ever present ghostly fog are the breathtaking platform for our story to unfold It s a film where everything is used to weave a dreamlike beauty Even the silken robes and dresses worn by Hsiao Tsing become living parts of the movie whether in romantic sequences or battle scenes the ever present silk flows across the screen Even a simple scene where Hsiao Tsing changes robes is turned into a thing of fluttering beauty as every skill on the set combines to create a most memorable scene from such a simple act The sets are also amazing giving an other worldly sense to the forests and the temple and harshness to the scorched flag filled wasteland of hell for the amazing finale The production design by Zhongwen Xi deserves the highest praise br br Another major factor to the films success is the music by Romeo Diaz and James Wong Hong Kong films have given us some fantastic music and songs that have added so much to the success of a sequence but on A Chinese Ghost Story the music is quite simply vital From the opening song onwards the music becomes as important as the characters br br The score is a perfect mixture of modern and traditional instruments Drums bells and guitars pound away over the action sequences to great effect but it s in the slower achingly romantic pieces that it comes into it s own Here flutes strings and female choral effects create what are possibly the finest pieces of music heard in an HK film Add to this the female vocal stunningly beautiful song that plays over Tsau shen s and Hsiao Tsing s love making nothing is ever seen but the effect is wonderful This is lovingly innocent movie romance and you have a shining example of the power a film s music can have br br And we of course have the acting talent Leslie Cheung A Better Tomorrow 1 2 and a very popular singer is outstanding as the innocent tax collector His work in the thankfully mild comic sequences is never over the top and his scenes with Joey Wang are played with just the right amount of passion and innocence br br Joey Wang who would later be mostly relegated to support roles in films like the Chow Yun Fat Andy Lau classic God of Gamblers has never looked more radiant than how she does here She is the epitome of ethereal beauty Her portrayal of the tragic Hsiao Tsing is stunning She shows her characters sadness at what she has become and what she is made to do but also gives off a subtle eroticism in the scenes where she is luring the men to their gruesome deaths Veteran actor Wu Ma Mr Vampire Swordsman is great fun as the wise brave but ever so grumpy Yen He treads a fine line between the eccentric and the annoying with practised ease And what so easily could have been a character that could have harmed the film is actually wonderfully entertaining and memorable br br But what about the monsters and beasties I hear you cry Well they range from the rather crude but fun stop motion animatronic zombies that inhabit the temple resulting in a great running gag with constantly thwarted attempts to munch on the amusingly unsuspecting Tsau shen to the rather cheesy but surprisingly effective Lord Black Complete with an arsenal of vicious flying heads and quite outstanding wire work Most of which has to this day never been topped br br But the most outstanding effect and creation is the tree spirit s killer tongue We first encounter this thing with an Evil Dead style rushing camera effect as it powers down its victims throats to deliver a lethal French kiss that turns the victims into zombiefied husks But later it s shown in all its crazy glory It can grow so big and long that it shoots through the forest after prey rips apart trees wraps itself around buildings and coils it s slimy length around people before picking them up and throwing them against tree trunks It can even split open to reveal a fang filled mouth It s an outrageous idea that given the deeply romantic main plot shouldn t work But it does to fantastic and unforgettable effect br br So what all this adds up to is a classic example of Hong Kong movie making A true team effort that has given us a truly ground breaking movie It s a film packed with wit invention action monsters martial arts ghosts fantastic ideas lush visuals beautiful music and most important to it s enduring charm one of cinemas most moving romances
Bread very sharply skewers the conventions of horror movies in general and Night of the Living Dead in specific and is constantly inventive The production values are a little rough at times it s a student film after all but it never loses sight of its goal to entertain Hey George Romero liked it enough to include it on the remastered Dead video tape laserdisc and DVD that should tell you something
Before viewing please make sure you have seen Night of the Living Dead This might well be THE best 7 minute parody I have ever seen Absurd crappy special effects the rope the rope and maneating slices of bread what more do you need br br Do not watch this movie while eating bread you might get scared
I just viewed this great good natured parody of Night of the Living Dead and I have to say it was so awful and so corny it was excellent This movie incorporated all the antics and scenery shots that the original had including the cemetery the supposable abandoned house the basement and the front lawn What I especially love about this movie is the comical use of bread and all the common household enemies bread has a grudge against C mon we know that toasters toaster ovens and zip locks have done bread in a dozen times and now we must call for their help in order to defeat the reanimated bread Aside from the cheap acting and voice overs this short horror film is my personal favorite parody of Night of the Living Dead even better than Night of the Living Dead of 1990 br br I think what makes this movie worth watching is how the writers and directors utilized all the dialogue from the original movie and revolved it around bread including how the bread became reanimated and to avoid leftovers because they are especially dangerous Another great reason why I love this movie is that there is no exception as to what bread is evil bagels are evil and even communions are evil which is demonstrated by a hilarious scene involving a newscaster and a rather monotone priest I think that the actors are especially humorous performing the deed of being viscously attacked by slices of bread i e the car scene I think the end is very worth sticking around br br Even though this is a short and that Night of the Day of the Dawn of the Son of the Bride of the Return of the Revenge of the Terror of the Attack of the Evil Mutant Alien Flesh Eating Hellbound Zombified Living Dead Part 2 In Shocking 2 D is debatably another great parody it s still recommend as a great horror parody done by what seems to be college filmmakers I highly recommend this movie to anybody who is able to make fun of Night of the Living Dead and still have respect for the filmmakers I would also like to recommend this movie to anybody who loves D movies and horror parody s it s just a wonderful little short horror film that s fun to watch and learn
Being someone who lists Night of the Living Dead at number three in her top five favorite movies of all time and at the same time loving this student film parody I feel I must defend this movie against the previously posted scathing reviews This short but sweet opus has always been a crowd pleaser at horror and science fiction movie marathons where those who attend have a love of the genre yet know not to take zombie movies too seriously This film is a tribute to the original not an insult It is intended to be funny and many others who I have heard chant for and applaud it agree with me that it succeeds Especially for those of us who have seen NOTLD 50 times Watch for the director cameo as news reporter Jeff Drexel and also if you have the opportunity catch his Alien parody Loaf
Having seen the short a number of times at horror movie marathons I believe it to be a humorous parody that slices to the main point of its reference br br Though the themes are crusty and stale to today s viewers it is by no means a crumby waste of time br br Though being a student film gives little rise to an excuse the proof is that it appears crafted with care on a budget of little to no dough br br As noted by another reviewer it is less than ten minutes which is plenty of time to cleanse the viewing palate with a toast of joy sit back and loaf idly through the film br br I think this short bread of a film should be enjoyed as an appetizer for the title reference and the viewer should relax and roll with it
Joan Fontaine here is entirely convincing as an amoral beauty who is entirely incapable of feeling love for anyone but herself Her husband Richard Ney has lost all his money through a combination of his foolhardiness and her extravagance and they are reduced to living in a tiny room with little or no prospects They continue to put on the most amazing clothes and go out and socialize as if nothing were wrong He is a charming feckless but wholly amiable fellow However Fontaine decides he has to go as he has outlived his usefulness So she resolves to poison him when she realizes he does not want to divorce her so that she can move on She has meanwhile had a lover Patric Knowles whom she decides to drop because he is not rich either She meets the aging Herbert Marshall who has a yacht with all the trimmings and more money than even Fontaine could figure out how to spend She targets him and decides he will do nicely He is all too eager to be eaten up by the young beauty He certainly isn t very exciting and has about as much sex appeal as yesterday s omelette But Fontaine is one of those gals who has eyes only for money and the man standing between her and it is transparent so that she doesn t even notice or care what he looks like she looks through him and sees what she really wants and goes for it She proceeds to poison her husband and dispatches him very neatly and satisfactorily so that everything is going well But as always happens in the movies and sometimes even in life some unexpected things begin to go wrong and the tension rises appreciably so that Fontaine begins to sweat Fontaine is particularly good at looking wicked and terrified and as the net begins to close in on her her rising sense of desperation is palpable and has us on the edges of our seats Hysteria and fear take over from cool calculation and cunning But she finds a fall guy for her crime in the person of her cast off lover who is an innocent victim of her scheme to set him up He is condemned to death for murder because the husband s death by poison came to light unexpectedly But Sir Cedric Hardwicke playing a grimly determined Scotland yard inspector thinks there may be something amiss and begins to doubt the story and suspect Fontaine He closes in on her and some of the scenes as this happens are inspired portrayals of the wildest panic But will the innocent man s life be saved before he is executed Will Fontaine worm her way out of this one Will Herbert Marshall protect her to safeguard his infatuation This film is expertly directed by Sam Wood and the film is a really superb suspense thriller which I suppose qualifies very well for the description of a superior film noir
Does anyone happen to know where this film was shot The aviation scene on the cliff is beautiful It appears to be England However Ivy s apartment building certainly looks like the Brill Building with its fascinating elevators br br Charles Mendl is listed as playing Sir Charles Gage Maybe I blinked but I never saw him Perhaps he was the husband s lawyer but again I don t recall that character being in the film other than being mentioned as having made a phone call Perhaps he was in the aviation scene Or the ballroom scene Did anyone spot him br br Herbert Marshall was 57 years old when he shot this film
Warning contains a spoiler Corny plot and in many cases terrible acting Fontaine is great but some others particularly Richard Ney Ivy s husband are exceedingly wooden Ney lies in bed dying of arsenical poisoning with every hair in place Yet the movie is so juicy and so suspenseful More faithful to the book than most movies of its era Casting Joan Fontaine as a poisoner and an adulteress which was just as shocking then I m not kidding kids was a masterful stroke She s just her usual Joan Fontainey self As murderers were supposed to she dies by falling feet foremost through the floor into an empty space
An excellent period murder melodrama with Fontaine effectively playing against her earlier naive wallflower type in a role that reportedly Olivia DeHavilland turned down That s fine because Fontaine is wonderful Scripted by Charles Bennett who had written for Hitchcock in the thirties and also later penned the excellent script for the classic British horror film Night of the Demon The opening scene where Ivy visits a sinister fortune teller played by the wonderful Una O Connor the screecher of James Whale fame is a tour de force and the film maintains interest throughout the numerous sinister machinations I hope to see this film on DVD someday but despair of that ever happening because it seems to be an undeservedly obscure film Fortunately I got to see it on AMC some seven or eight years ago but have not seen since Catch it if you can
Poor Ivy Though to the manner born she had the bad luck to marry a charming wastrel Richard Ney As the movie is set in the 20s or 30s when rigid Victorian ideas of class were starting to fray at the edges this uncertain status vexes her unduly The Gretorexes for so they are called don t know where their next shilling is coming from but there are yachting parties and fancy dress balls in posh pleasaunces aplenty to tempt her When Ivy Joan Fontaine makes the acquaintance of a wealthy older gent Herbert Marshall who must have been born middle aged she sets one of her extravant chapeaux for him Luckily one of the beaux she still strings along Patric Knowles is a physician whose consulting rooms provide a cache of poison with which she bids her hubby farewell The fact that it implicates Knowles doesn t phase her a bit even as the hours trickle by until he should be hanged by the neck until dead The turning of the plot depends on police inspector Sir Cedric Hardwicke Knowles mother the redoubtable Lucile Watson and Knowles loyal housekeeper Una O Connor Sam Wood adds some subtle touches to this well above average melodrama Fontaine s luminous face supplies the rest
Joan Fontaine stars as the villain in this Victorian era film She convincingly plays the married woman who has a lover on the side and also sets her sights on a wealthy man Miles Rushworth who is played by Herbert Marshall Mr Marshall is quite good as Miles Miss Fontaine acted her part to perfection she was at the same time cunning calculating innocent looking frightened and charming It takes an actress with extraordinary talent to pull that off Joan Fontaine looked absolutely gorgeous in the elegant costumes by Travis Banton Also in the film is Joan s mother Lillian Fontaine as Lady Flora I highly recommend this film
Loved Joan Great performance What isn t she good in I watched this film and then Jane Eyre right after she just keeps getting better My heart was racing Great old movie drama Just what i want from a classic movie Facial expressions are worth the whole film I m glad i have it on video Don t know what more you need in a film Beautiful woman wealth greed murder detectives a trial br br The costumes are very nice Makes me wonder what the budget was for this movie Wish they still made films like this Whenever they try they just seem to make a cheesy movie Films in black and white still hold a certain mystery
There is indeed much to complain about this movie version of Molnar s mystical play Farrell looks good in his title role but his line readings frankly stink This also suffers in large part from this being credited as the first movie that makes use of rear projection The sets look phony br br There are two great strengths in this show however although the dialogue readings limp the visual performances are perfect Rose Hobart as Julie is little remembered today mostly for ROSE HOBART in which Joseph Cornell cut down the programmer EAST OF BORNEO to simply shots of her credit Melford s stylish visual direction of the original Her great beauty and simple although stagy performance help repair some of the damage to the earth bound sections of this movie br br However one of Borzage s themes is the mystical power of love and it is the handling of the celestial sections that make this great from the arrival of the celestial train to the journey to the Hot Place H B Warner s performance here is as always perfect br br So we have here a flawed but very interesting version I think that Lang s 1934 version is better as well as the celestial scenes in the Henry King version of CAROUSEL the watered down musical remake But I still greatly enjoyed this version and think you should give it a chance
Although Lang s version is more famous Borzage s work is not devoid of interest far from it its celestial sequences are even better The metaphor of the train perhaps borrowed from the ending of Abel Gance s la roue is eventually more convincing than the up above heavenly world br br Borzage s tenderness for his characters shows in Marie s character and love beyond the grave is one of his favorite subjects the ending of three comrades The amusement park seems to be everywhere we see it even when we are in Marie s poor house I do not think that the sets are that much cheesy they are stylized to a fault The fair from a distance almost gives a sci fi feel to the movie br br Borzage never forgets his social concerns in the heavenly train going up the Rich cannot stand to be mixed up with the riffraff but as chief magistrate tells here there s no more difference br br Not a major work for Borzage neither is Lang s version but to seek out if you are interested in the great director s career
The Sea is Watching was an interesting film experience First of all the overall feel was intense internalized claustrophobic and small Each frame seemed to be a photograph of something inside something very focused and not part of a bigger picture It was obvious what we were to look at in each frame The physicality of the set itself contributed to that feeling of smallness and intensity The lights along the middle of the road cut the road in half and the tiny gate to the tiny settlement followed by the tiny and few cubbyholes that served as the establishments that made up what seemed to be the entire town Even the view of the ocean was framed by a tiny landing on which one can count the number of longer grass swaying in the wind No panoramic views In fact it reminded me of the Montmarte sequence of Moulin Rouge where the camera sweepingly focuses in to the windmill creating again a feeling of a small area where everything is happening br br While the acting was passable considering I really could not discern how the lines were truly delivered I felt that the actions were overly melodramatic and nonsensical Why Kikuno would continue carrying on the way she did when Fusanosuke announced his impending marriage really didn t seem true people hadn t really changed that much and the character Kikuno was so strong and resilient that even if they were busy taking on O shin s business for naught the reaction seemed out of character and unnecessary and distracting Another example of odd acting was when the drunk boyfriend of Kikuno showed up and Ryosuke decided to intervene and was pushed down the stairs the way in which he got up and menacingly came up the stairs and the ensuing fight outside among the reeds was simply unsatisfying It wasn t that I like fight scenes au contraire but it seemed a little stilted and again overly dramatic br br Otherwise while not a beautiful movie to watch it provided an interesting glimpse into the darker side of prostitution as opposed to the geisha Unfortunately perhaps it fed into our expectations of wanton women the honey I ll give you a deal comments supported by the over stretched actions and seriously caused me to doubt whether indeed 19th century prostitutes really acted in that way But once inside the house the inner workings became most interesting vivid and real and provided a scenario I never anticipated or imagined in my romantic view of Japan in the 19th century
Artistically speaking this is a beautiful movie the cinematography music and costumes are gorgeous In fact this movie is prettier than those directed by Akira Kurasawa himself In this case he only wrote the movie as it was made several years after his death br br So as far as the writing goes the dialog was well written and the story at times was interesting However the story was also rather depressing yet uninvolving in some ways after all it s the story of a group of women who work in a brothel It s interesting that although prostitution has been seen as a much more acceptable business in Japan the women STILL long for a better life This reminds me a lot of the movie Streets Of Shame though Streets Of Shame s characters are a lot less likable and more one dimensional br br So overall it gets a 7 mostly due to everything BUT the writing It s too bad that the weakest link in this movie is the story by the great Kurasawa
The Sea Is Watching has been made from an original Akira Kurosawa script and it is indeed a lush and warm film Watching it will be a pleasure br br Kei Kumai as director is certainly no equal to the old but everlasting master particularly the mass scenes in the beginning of the film has some terrible acting but the overall mood and scenery is very enjoyable Another thing that is missed here Kurosawa always managed to let the characters be so much more then what they are actually showing and doing br br Probably that was his magic on set while shooting and just maybe this script was not fully up to par yet br br Maybe we just miss the eye of the master br br This is one lovely and sweet film but it is no Kurosawa To expect that might well be very silly
Kurosawa weaves a tale that has a cast of characters as diverse as any Shakespearean drama and the acting is true to the story with each star playing their role as a part of the larger tale It is touching funny and intriguing in all parts The character development is near perfect the cinematography is vivid and engaging and the story draws you in br br I would like to say that the Samurai freaks and those obsessed with late 18th and 19th century dynastic tales of Japan may snub this film as not Kurosawa s best work Perhaps not his best but even at his worst Kurosawa is better than many of the best This story is so based in elevating the mundane lives of ordinary people in a time of great change that it is timeless despite being set in the not so distant past br br I would heartily recommend this to any movie buff and especially to those who are likely to continue on to read the novel on which the film is based
This is a very fine and poetic story Beautiful scenery Magnificent music score I ve been twice in Japan last year and the movie gave me this typical Japanese feeling The movement of the camera is superb as well as the actors It goes deep into your feelings without becoming melodramatic Japanese people are very sensitive and kind and it s all very well brought onto the screen here The director is playing superb with light an colors and shows the audience that it is also possible to let them enjoy a movie with subtle and fine details Once you ve seen this movie you will want to see more from the same director It s a real feel good movie and I can only recommend it to everybody
This is a wonderful movie about a brothel in a fishing village that could be best described with scene constellations and direction of old Kurosawa s works combined with Dostoyevski s topics of human psychology O shin Sonia Marmeladova Shakespeare s drama and Hans Christian Andersen s tragic and cheerfulness The screenplay is wondrous the scenes are colour and beautiful some scenes stay really imprinted in my mind The plot is interesting and unpredictable each of the characters is very well developed and interesting there is also a little action so if you don t like all the sentiments you d also come to your costs It is not about mysterious Geishas and proud Samurai with their Bushido pouring all out of them but about life work and kinds of people found everywhere at any time A lovely and fascinating tribute to Kurosawa certainly worth seeing
It helps immensely if one is familiar with the culture and time period in which this film takes place First of all these ladies are NOT geisha they are oiran prostitutes in the Yoshiwara type green houses circa 1860 give or take This should help clear up some details which may be confusing to the unaware The film deals with issues of loyalty love and perhaps most importantly how people deal with adversity both their own and that of others in their immediate environment That plus the outrageous photography together with the hauntingly beautiful music make for a lovely ride Just plug it in suspend your disbelief and enter their world You won t be disappointed
this movie just goes to show that you dont need big explosions muti billion dollar computer graphics or highly over paid actors and actresses to make a good movie All you need is a excellent story line and plot which the master of all japanese films Akira Kurosawa pulls off brilliantly I recommend this film to all that love a epic period piece and for those that enjoy Kurosawas earlier works 10 10
I m not sure how I missed this one when it first came out but I am glad to have finally seen it br br This movie takes place in and around the 19th century red light district of Okabasho Japan It tells the tale of prostitution caste systems and women who are strong in a society based upon the strength of the samurai code of Japan br br It is uniquely Akira Kurosawa Even though he died before he could direct this movie his adaptation of the screenplay shows His view of the Japanese world and caste system is renowned and sheds light upon how these systems interact with each other The characters may revolve around each other but the caste system stays intact when each character goes back to the world they belong in The samurai warrior who drifts into the good hearted and loving prostitute s world goes back to his life while she embarks on a another road with a man who is part of her caste system lowest of the low Many prize the world of the samurai above all others but yet it is the lower caste inhabitants who can support each other and who can love without restraint The samurai in this movie turns out to be the weak one while the classless lovers prove to be the honorable ones br br The movie deserves a higher rating It is a tale of survival of women in feudal Japan During this time frame men were thought to be the survivors the strong ones while women were thought to be just mindless and weak property This movie highlights the strength of Japanese women and how they did what they had to for survival and how their strength enabled the Japanese culture to continue on as it has br br I recommend The Sea is Watching to anyone who is a fan of Akira Kurosawa and even if they re not a fan It is a lovely quiet and soul sustaining movie and one to be treasured for any movie collection
Umi wa miteita The Sea is Watching was Akira Kurasawa s swansong to film his adaptation of his favored novelist Shugoro Yamamoto s story into a screenplay he intended to film was his final mark he left on a brilliant career Director Kei Kumai pays homage to both Kurosawa and Yamamoto in presenting this visually stunning transformation of word to image br br Set in 19th century Japan the story explores the lives of the women of a Geisha house whose sole purpose in life is to earn money by pleasuring men The house is run by an older couple who are genteel and the geishas are an enchanting group of women who know their trade and take pride in their careers Each has a reason for turning to the life of geisha Oshin Nagiko Tono supports her family who live in a neighboring village Kikuno Misa Shimizu has customers both good and evil whom she manages to sustain with her stories of her higher caste Oshin befriends an endangered samurai falls in love with the gentle fellow only to find that he must not marry out of his caste and leaves his pleasures with Oshin to marry his promised betrothed Oshin s heart bruises easily but is always supported emotionally and physically monetarily by Kikuno and the other geishas br br A handsome samurai Ryosuke Masatoshi Nagase enters Oshin s life and develops the first trusted and devoted relationship with her Kikuno is beset by problems deciding whether to accept the humble love of an old man who wishes to marry her and coping with a rich but abusive customer All the while the sea is watching and as a typhoon destroys the geisha house and street Oshin and Kikuno sit atop the roof waiting for the promised rescue by Ryosuke The manner in which the story ends is one of sacrifice love and devotion The sea is watching and will find protection for true love br br The photography by Kazuo Okuhara is breathtakingly beautiful night scenes with glowing lanterns and colorful geisha interiors are matched with recurring glimpses of the sea both calm and turbulent The acting is a bit strained for Edo art but the characters are well created and keep the story credible The one distraction which is definitely NOT something Kurosawa would have condoned is the tacky Western music score that sounds like cheap soap opera filler except for the isolated moments when real Japanese music on authentic instruments graces the track But in the end there is enough of Kurosawa s influence to imbue this film with his brand of dreamlike wonder that will always maintain his importance on world cinema Grady Harp
My boyfriend and I both enjoyed this film very much The viewer is swept away from modern life into old Japan while at the same time exposed to very current themes The characters are realistic and detailed it has an unpredictable ending and story which is very refreshing The story is made up of mini plots within the life of several geisha living together in a poor city district I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in a realistic romance or life in old Japan br br
A tragically wonderful movie brings us to a Japan that does not exist anymore Despite Hollywood s technical expertise I have yet to see a hollywood movie that can match the authenticity of the atmosphere in this small town by the river near the sea Tom Cruise s The Last Samurai looked liked the last installment of the Lord of The Rings in trying to capture rural Old Japan br br If you like serene but intense story lines this is a must see film It will be a respite from hollow flashy films much like the last 1000 blockbusters you saw I think this is one of Kurosawa s better stories br br Even if it s a movie about geishas and brothels and the complicated rules that govern life in such settings it did not turn into a skin flick The characters are full of depth and act with much intensity
A wonderful film to watch with astonishing scenes and talented actors such as Misa Shimizu and Nagiko Tono After 15 minutes of watching your eyes get locked on the screen and you do nothing but breathing in the atmosphere of the film waiting what the destiny will bring to the characters This film makes you leave your position as a standard audience it takes you in it makes you a part of the story Costumes and settings are brilliant especially the district of the okiyas is skillfully built It is definitely not very Akira Kurosawa however it still gets a lot from the master especially the stylistic story telling tells us we re in a distinguished land of cinema which is quite far from hollywoodish flamboyance
I can understand those who dislike this movie cause of a lack of knowledge br br First of all those girls are not Geisha but brothel tenants and one that don t know the difference will not understand half of the movie and certainly not the end This is a complete art work about the women s life and needs in this era Everything is important and certainly the way they dress all over the movie means more than words To those who thought it was a boring geisha movie I ll suggest you to read a bit about this society before making a conclusion that is so out of the reality This is Kurosawa s work of is life and I m sure that the director understood the silent meaning of Kurosawa s piece to the right intellectual range
Contrary to some people s summaries the women depicted in the film are not geisha They are oiran prostitutes living outside the most famous pleasure districts and their lives and experiences represent the lives of a great number of Tokugawa era women I can t say the stories were particularly enlightening but their charm lies in just how typical they are The themes are universal and everyday love friendship and sacrifice br br I did greatly enjoy the art direction and the acting I felt like I was getting a glimpse of a time and place I can never otherwise glimpse The actors especially the 4 women who played the main oiran were a thrill to watch I d only recommend this movie to people who want a taste of Japanese culture or to those who enjoy quiet and emotional stories It s a great example of both
I really liked this movie and went back to see it two times more within a week br br Ms Detmers nailed the performance she was like a hungry cat on the prowl toying with her prey She lashes out in rage and lust taking a too young lover and crashing hundreds of her terrorist fianc√© s mother s pieces of fine china to the floor br br The film was full of beautiful touches The Maserati the wonderful wardrobe the flower boxes along the rooftops I particularly enjoyed the ancient Greek class and the recitation of Antigone br br It had a feeling of Story of O that is where people of means indulge in unrestrained sexual adventure As she walks around the fantastic apartment in the buff she is at ease and why not what is to restrain a Devil in the Flesh br br The whole movie is a real treat
the movie is far more sophisticated and intelligent is its exploration of sexual tension than such American attempts as 9 and a half weeks the courtroom scene itself with the couple copulating in the cage while the heroine pleads for their orgasm is amazing I have not seen this movie in 20 years but it made indelible pictures in my mind it is rich in texture and successful in creating a world where sex is the engine for all activity and at its bottom is the yawning angst that lives in us all the plot is European and it meanders a bit but so does life especially when you are 17 and have a constant hard on
Notable because of it s notorious explicit scene when the gorgeous Maruschka Detmers takes her young lover s penis from his trousers and into her mouth Even without this moment the film is a splendid if slightly disturbing passionate and blindingly sexy ride Detmers puts in a great performance as the partly deranged insatiable delight wandering about her flat nude Dressed partly dressed and naked she steals most of the film about love sexual passion philosophy and politics For me the last two get a little lost and the ending is most confusing when her fianc√© is released whilst fellow terrorists are released she seems uncertain as to who she wants and the young lover seems more interested in his exams than anything else as she weeps beautifully of course
I loved the the film it beautifully analyzes Italian petty bourgeois society how the leftists of the 70s have given up all their ideals and come to a happy arrangement which they don t want disturbed For instance the aging psychoanalyst who is jealous of his own son and doesn t want to be reminded of his more radical youth br br For a long time wanted to buy the video after having seen the movie a couple of times on the big screen and on TV but it seems to have completely disappeared from the market even in Italy no one in the book shops knew about the film a great pity br br The one sex scene which everyone seems to go on about does the film no harm
Bellocchio refers to this as a mainly political movie a description of the revolutionary movement in Italy but that seems more metaphor than reality Well almost everything in the movie seems like metaphor The revolutionaries of whom we see and about whom we learn very little might as well be mafiosi Out with the old and in with the new br br Andrea s Papa a psychoanalyst seems to stand for the usual traditional bourgeois values morally upright unperturbed clean and tidy thoroughly ritualized br br Giullia the girlfriend of a revolutionary seems to represent what can happen to someone who needs very badly a cause to support but is unable to muster up the kind of devotion such a commitment demands I m guessing here Andrea the adolescent boy seems to be the only guy in the movie who is not in some unquiet way upatz He s respectful of his father but disobedient too He loves Giullia or so we assume although he s not really old enough to have learned how to manage his reflexes optimally but he leaves her in order to show up at school and complete his final exams His course between these contradictory lifestyles could be described as media He s the man in between who knows the meaning of gradualism who can keep his cool while those about him are screaming br br Most of this is summed up during the oral part of his finals when he is asked to translate and comment on an excerpt from Antigone which contrasts the traditional authority of the gods with the notion of secularity and free will br br That brings us by no particular course that I m aware of to Marushka Detmars She brings to mind a New Yorker cartoon of a few years ago Two hippos are neck deep in the river staring at a gazelle drinking from the bank and one hippo says to the other I hate her She s a good actress Let me get that out of the way But so is everyone else in the film She carries with her in her speech and manner the rich glitter of outright lunacy And it all comes from the actress too not from directorial aid Detmars isn t nuts the way Catherine DeNeuve was nuts in Repulsion The walls don t turn to rubber and grow hands Instead we see her animated sometimes TOO animated And she gives us shocking jolts when her mood abruptly changes and becomes threatening the way a looming thunderstorm is threatening br br A critic described her as sultry but that s probably not the word he was searching for She s compellingly beautiful with her fluffy brown hair her wide white ready grin her impulsive giggles And her eyes are like the eyes in the paintings on the walls of ancient Egyptian tombs The sexy parts are pretty erotic not so much because one of them is explicit but because we ve gotten to know the characters involved It s more interesting to spy on the honeymoon couple next door than go to a skin flick Actually there isn t THAT much sex There is only one scene of simulated intercourse but the director lets it play out in what seems to be real time At least real time for an eighteen year old boy br br The young man who plays Andrea is fine too which is a necessary thing because the film depends almost entirely on him and Giullia They have to carry it and they do If it were not for their performances I m not sure this would be as interesting or as admirable flick as it is It could easily have been turned into a rather slow boring romance br br Worth it
I ll be quick to address the matters of the film here It was a very engaging story about the destructive qualities about all consuming passions a young Italian woman who cannot emotionally connect with her jailed political radical fianc√© due in part to her apolitical attitudes and freewheeling approach to life finds solace and passion in a new young lover whom she embarks on an explicitly sexual relationship with The anxieties rage tenderness and passions that swirl around in the atmosphere of the story equal the dispassionate quiet that seems to engulf the two leads It lends the film an unsettling mood that permeates through all the political strife that is otherwise lost on the viewer unless you have a deep knowledge of Italian politics during the 80 s I found the film compelling what ruined it somewhat is a gratuitous oral sex scene that the actress performs on the male lead it isn t simulated and leaves little to the imagination There are other scenes of sex in the film which I do feel were necessary because they outline the madness and loneliness that the characters live in But the oral sex scene I feel derails the focus on the actual story It was smooth sailing up until that point and once the infamous sex scene appears which caused much hoopla back in its day it s like hitting a roadblock It s jarring and unnecessary and I am in the camp that believes that the film would not have been harmed any if the scene had been removed from it And what s unfortunate is that this particular scene may deter people from watching this intriguing film which I believe is worth a viewing because there is so much going on underneath the surface emotions and further turmoils layered in the subtext br br Overall Wonderful film hampered by a much not needed sex scene
This 1986 Italian French remake of the 1946 film of the same name turns up the heat early and doesn t let us come up for air The story is about a high school student Federico Pitzalis who can t keep his eyes off the mysteriously beautiful young woman played by Dutch phenom Maruschka Detmers who lives next door to the school One day he follows her and his persistence pays off There s only one problem She s engaged to a sketchy character Riccardo De Torrebruna who may or may not have committed a heinous crime and if he repents will probably be let off with a slap on the wrist Also the young woman is a little funny in the head and this is corroborated when we discover she has been seeing the boy s father who is a psychiatrist Giulia s emotional instability is only equalled by her prodigious sexual desires Hot hot hot from the word go with handsome leads and a bombshell performance from Detmers who plays us like a yo yo as she does the boy from scene to scene with enough suspense to keep us guessing right up until and even after the end Available in R and X rated versions
Cashing in on the demons meets clergy trend of the late 60s early 70s that most prominently included the triptych of Rosemary s Baby The Exorcist and The Omen The Sentinel is an addition that s just as good albeit the most overlooked of the lot In a way it combines the best elements of those films and tosses in a dash of Polanski s The Tenant which came out the same year for good measure A New York model unable to commit to her lawyer boyfriend takes up residence in a moss coated townhouse that initially seems like the perfect locale she meets a wily old coot of a neighbor the brilliant Burgess Meredith plus the other off center tenants Kept awake by loud noises above her apartment she soon discovers that a mute priest and herself are the only residents in the otherwise deserted building From there director Michael Winner Death Wish kicks this supernatural thriller into gear and there is a devilish glee to the hallucinogenic tortures he inflicts on his heroine Aided by a brilliant ensemble cast a subtle storyline and excellent makeup FX by Dick Smith The Exorcist The Sentinel is a genuinely creepy horror flick
I m surprised that no one yet has mentioned that there are two versions of this same film The lion s share of the footage in both is identical but here is where they differ In one version the version I have seen most often on broadcast TV the group of clerics guarding the gateway consists of the Brotherhood of the Protectors a fictional splinter group of priests and brothers excommunicated by the Church In the other version which I ve seen only once on TV the clerics guarding the gateway are depicted as priests of the official Church meaning the Archdiocese of New York or perhaps Brooklyn Also in the former version in most of the pertinent scenes the clerics are referred to as brothers and in some scenes you can see where the lips say Father so and so but the dubbed audio says Brother so and so In the latter version I believe everyone is referred to as Father br br In any event it seems that one of these two versions is more or less a partial re shooting of the other with all Brotherhood of the Protector scenes re shot as Archdiocese scenes or vice versa Kind of reminds me of the Raymond Burr cutaway scenes in Godzilla I have videotaped both versions off broadcast TV so no I m not imagining this Can anyone shed some more light on the story behind these two versions of the film
Wonderful film one of the best horror films of the 70s She is realistic settings and atmospheres As usual it was inevitable the usual negative comments I have noticed that most horror films of a certain period many times fail to reach even sufficiency Obviously because most horror movies are old and must be denigrati is like a mental mechanism that moves the minds of the potential of music critics here br br Before you read the review already knew what was the final judgment In the film a good gift because 10 is really well done Raines reads quite well and the film as a way in which it was produced reminds me a lot of Kubrick films He really impression Excellent film really I consider a film anthology of years 70
Well after long anticipation after seeing a few clips on Bravo s The 100 Scariest Movie Moments I had long awaited to see this film The plot was simple beautiful model Alison Parker Cristina Raines moves into an apartment building that s a gateway to hell The Sentinel is a down right creepy film even if it s a bit slow It s a mix of The Omen and Rosemary s Baby The acting is fine and there are some truly disturbing bits such as the awkward orgy scene with the dead father and the chubby woman in the middle of the orgy eating cake and laughing The ending is a weird mix of deformed people and cannibals It s a very odd campy but in the end I truly believe a great film One of my favorites from the 70 s even if it s nothing greatly original It s wacky and extremely creepy Probably one of my all time favorites 9 10
I had the TV on for a white noise companion and heard 400 for a fully furnished apartment So I ran into the TV room expecting another 70 s flick and got much more Luckily I could rewind to the beginning DVR buffer and hit the record button to watch it entirely Cinemax uncut and in HD no less Aside from some holes in the story and intermittent improbable dialog events this is an effective thriller worthy of your time to watch Pretty creepy and progressive at times Beverly D Angelo s character masturbates in front of Alison Parker played adroitly by Cristina Raines Parker stabs in very gory fashion her father an explicit menage a trios scene don t let the kids watch The film is TOTALLY 70 s full of bad clothes polyester suits and tacky ascots and decor bad hair over bloated music score and familiar looking cinematography The cast is excellent take a second on this film s home page to check it out It was a surprise to see Christopher Walken Jerry Orbach and Jeff Goldblum so young Sylvia Miles always wonderfully creepy ENJOY
Ahh yes the all star blockbuster Take a so so concept stuff it into a script and load it down with every single freakin special effect that the Wizards of Hollyweird can conjure up then round up the usual suspects hot up and comers has beens wanna be s and never wuzzes and stick em all in ensemble roles of various sizes in front of the unforgiving eye of the cameras And hope to gawd that some of them aren t too old to remember their lines br br Leave it to the bishops of Box Office to apply the concept to horror films at last as was the case with the post EXORCIST thriller THE SENTINEL Novelist Jeffrey Konvitz decided to try and one up Ira Levin s ROSEMARY S BABY scenario of creepy and ultimately satanic neighbors in a New York brownstone The result was a controversial best seller that some claimed bordered on the plagiaristic and an equally controversial top heavy star laden vehicle co written and directed by DEATH WISH s Michael Winner but for many unsettlingly different reasons br br Cristina Raines NASHVILLE plays successful model Alison Parker who is pretty much over stressed and over worked I won t add overpaid I mean she IS a model so that would be redundant not just by her 24 7 schedule by also by her insistent wanna get married right NOW boyfriend Michael Chris Sarandon of DOG DAY AFTERNOON and the classic SOB I G movie LIPSTICK One of the ways she decides to try to get away from it all is to move into her own place a big beautiful brownstone in Manhattan which she s able to get dirt cheap that should ve been the BIG red flag cheap real estate in New York from the mysteriously accommodating broker Miss Logan Golden Age screen vet Ava Gardner fresh from the storm drain in EARTHQUAKE br br Things seem fine at first but ah yes then comes the noises and the loud pounding from the apartment upstairs at night And what about the REALLY strange neighbors like Gerde Sylvia Miles and Sandra a VERY early Beverly D Angelo the nice single friends read lesbians living together and kindly old Mr Charles Chazen a nicely creepy Burgess Meredith who seems maybe a little too concerned with Alison s welfare And that s not to mention other assorted squirrelly cohabitants You ll never hear the phrase Black and white cat black and white cake again without wanting to laugh milk through your nose and possibly vomit simultaneously Especially the old blind priest living in the penthouse br br Things really start to go downhill when an apparition laden nightmare of Alison s morphs into a grisly murder in one of the movie s most underwear staining scares and both Alison and Michael with some assistance from Alison s BFF Jennifer Deborah Raffin begin to piece together the puzzle that reveals the brownstone s dark origins as well as the murderous agenda of its other worldly inhabitants not to mention Alison s connection to them which as it turns out is anything but coincidental br br Although there s nothing controversial about the overstuffed cast which seems to feature every actor of diverse genres looking for work at the time Arthur Kennedy Jose Ferrer Martin Balsam Eli Wallach John Carradine and even early appearances by Christopher Walken Jeff Goldblum and Nana Visitor Winner and company went back to bombastic basics and pulled a Tod Browning by enlisting real life physically challenged actors to appear in THE SENTINEL S climactic everything and everybody goes to Hell sequence which I guess any ballsy director would do finding himself unable to access Linda Blair and a case of green pea soup It does definitely leave you with arctic fingers playing your spinal cord like a zither knowing this juicy little tidbit of info as you watch And it does feature a technique to which filmmakers have only begun to return very recently live on set makeup and special effects that don t involve CGI which was pretty much non existent back then br br THE SENTINEL has that kitschy late Seventies cheese factor but does manage to distinguish itself from time to time with some gasp inducing moments like the one mentioned above not to mention that queasy feeling of dread that horror writers find it easy to play upon of isolation and things that go bump and shriek in the night After all what living single in the big city person hasn t lain in bed in the dark and listened intently to the sounds of what they HOPE is the building settling br br Konvitz followed up THE SENTINEL with an inevitable sequel THE GUARDIAN not to be confused with the William Friedkin supernatural thriller namesake that was never adapted for the screen sigh of relief
Michael Winner is probably best known for his revenge themed films such as Death Wish and Chato s Land but he is equally gifted as a director of occult Horror cinema as The Sentinel of 1977 proves The Sentinel which is based on a novel by John Konvitz who also wrote the screenplay is a clever and immensely creepy religious chiller that no lover of occult Horror should consider missing The film is obviously inspired by successful occult classics such as Rosemary s Baby The Exorcist or The Omen but as far as I am concerned it is also easily as unsettling as these more widely acclaimed films and probably even creepier br br Allison Parker Christina Raines is a beautiful young New York model Traumatized by events in her her past and not yet willing to marry her lawyer boyfriend Chris Sarandon Allison is in search for an apartment and finds a big incredibly nice one which is also affordable in an old mansion in Brooklyn The new apartment however comes along with a bunch of very strange other tenants And the sinister new neighbors soon become more than a little bothersome to Alice This may not be an adequate plot synopsis but I would hate to spoil any of this film s great moments so I will not give any further plot description What I will say however is that The Sentinel is a very creepy and effective film that profits from a great cast as well as an often bizarre and constantly uncanny atmosphere The fact that director Michael Winner and writer John Konnvitz also acted as producers here certainly had its influence on the outcome The film is imaginatively photographed and the eerie old Brooklyn mansion is a fantastic setting for this kind of film As mentioned above the atmosphere is obscure and creepy and the film also includes several shock moments and genuine scares The film features many sinister and eccentric characters and the cast is superb Beautiful Christina Raines is great in her role of Allison Parker lovable and yet on the cusp to losing her mind Chris Sarandon is also very good as her boyfriend a successful lawyer and the supporting cast includes many big names such as Christopher Walken Jeff Goldblum Jerry Orbach Beverly D Angelo and Tom Berenger before becoming really famous The cast also includes stars like Ava Gardner Horror icon John Carradine Burgess Meredith and my personal favorite the great Eli Wallach as a cynical homicide detective I ve been a great fan of director Michael Winner for a long time mostly for films like Death Wish and Chato s Land The Sentinel is yet another great film in Winner s repertoire and also the proof that the man is not only a master of hard boiled revenge cinema but also of atmospheric occult Horror All in all The Sentinel is a creepy intelligent and amazingly bizarre occult chiller that is highly recommended to all Horror fans
Director writer Michael Winner s feature is a better than expected offbeat supernatural horror film although still schlock efficiently catered for which really does by go unnoticed Sure it might borrow ideas from other similar themed horror movies of this period but still manages to bring its own psychological imprint to the smokescreen material of good vs evil and a unique vision that has a fair share of impressively expansive if somewhat exploitative set pieces As a whole it s sketchy however remains intriguing by instilling an ominous charge without going gang busters with the scares Actually there s always something going on amongst its busy framework but it s rather down played with its shocks steering to soapy patterns and atmospheric tailoring up until its vividly repellent and grisly climax with a downbeat revelation Winner s dressed up craftsmanship might feel pedestrian however it s the ensemble cast that really holds it together as you try to spot the faces There s plenty too Some having more to do with the scheme of things than others but there s no doubts every one of them are committed despite the ludicrously crude nature of it all It s interesting to see names like Sylvia Miles who s significantly creepy Beverly D Angelo likewise Deborah Raffin Eli Wallach Christopher Walken William Hickey a neat cameo Jeff Goldblum Jerry Orbach and Tom Berenger in bit parts Then you got a mild mannered Chris Sarandon and movingly gorgeous Cristina Raines in the leads Offering able support Jos√© Ferrer Martin Balsam Ava Gardner John Carradine Burgess Meredith and Arthur Kennedy The script does throw around many characters as well as notions but gets disjointedly sidetrack by trying to squeeze all of it in However it s disorienting air works in its favour in establishing the suspicion and deception of what s really going on here Is there a reason for all of this and why is it surrounding Raines character The emphasis is mainly built upon that moody angle as it begins to slowly shed light of her inner goings and that of the strange worrying experiences she encounters when she s moves into her new apartment This is where Winner tries to pull out the eerie shades which projects some icy moments Gil Melle was the man responsible for the grand overpowering orchestral score that never misses a cue and Richard C Kratina instruments the sweeping scope like photography
The Sentinel is a movie that was recommended to me years ago by my father and i ve seen it many times since It always manages to entertain me while being effectively creepy as well The flashback scenes are what really made it for me Cristina Raines s father running around all creepily with the two creepy woman always manages to send chills down my spine it s your typical good vs evil thing but at least it manages to be entertaining The ending I consider to be one of the finest in Horror history It has plenty of shocks and suspense seeing Burgess Meredith do his thing as Chazen had me on the edge of my seat The Sentinel has the perfect build up of tension We are never fully comfortable whenever Allison is on screen We know something terrible is always awaiting her and that made things all the more tense This movie is often neglected among horror fans but I personally think it s one of the better one s out there and it certainly has enough for all Horror fans to be satisfied br br Performances Cristina Raines has her wooden moments but came though in a big way for the most part She s beautiful to look at and her chemistry with Saranadon felt natural Chris Sarandon is great as the boyfriend Michael He had an instant screen presence and I couldn t help but love him Martin Balsam Jos√© Ferrer John Carradine Ava Gardner Arthur Kennedy Sylvia Miles Deborah Raffin Jerry Orbach Richard Dreyfuss Jeff Goldblum and Tom Berenger all have memorable roles or small cameos Burgess Meredith is terrific as Chazen He looks like a normal old man but what we find out is absolutely terrifying Eli Wallach Christopher Wlaken do well as the bumbling detectives Beverly D Angelo has one chilling scene that I won t spoil br br Bottom line The Sentinel is an effective Horror film that Horror fans sadly tend to neglect It will give you the thrills and scares you need to be satisfied Well worth the look br br 7 10
Time has not been kind to this movie Once controversial adaptation of Jeffrey Konvitz best seller now this film looks like a mere mainstream version of your typical spookfest Gruesome touches aside particularly that crazy over the top finale this is essentially a glossy horror movie for those people that do not care much for the genre It has an extraordinary cast in small roles Jose Ferrer Ava Gardner Eli Wallach Burgess Meredith Christopher Walken and many others but something tells me that the producers wanted such an expensive cast in order to convince the audience that this is not your average lowbrow movie producers of 70s disaster movies had a similar idea I kind liked to see the familiar faces but the story is very silly and no matter how high class the film pretends to be it operates at the level of your average 70s exploitation movie not an entirely bad thing though Still it is an enjoyable movie especially for those viewers who enjoy stargazing As usual Albert Whitlock s matte work is outstanding Overall pretty entertaining
I m not sure why this little film has been banished into obscurity as despite some rather silly goings on The Sentinel is a clever and inventive horror film that gives most of the highly praised ghost stories of today more than a run for their money Michael Winner has admitted many times that he s not the best director of all time and that does shine through on a number of occasions with this film but it has to be said that the film works in spite of it s uninspired direction and the fact that Winner has somehow managed to round up a simply amazing cast of talent more than makes up for it The plot is rich with mystery and begins by focusing on Alison Parker and her hunt for a flat She finds that she can t afford most properties she looks at but thinks her luck has changed when she finds a fully furnished apartment for an affordable price Her problems start soon after moving in as she doesn t like her neighbours very much and this problem increases when the property broker tells her that she has just one neighbour an elderly blind priest on the top floor br br The cast list is truly superb with the relatively unknown Cristina Raines heading up a great support cast Chris Sarandon is a little wooden in his role opposite Raines but small parts for the likes of John Carradine Eli Wallach Ava Gardner Jeff Goldblum and Christopher Walken to name but a handful more than make up for Sarandon s lifeless portrayal Michael Winner does a good job with his central location as the block of flats provides a creepy and macabre setting for the story The film is a little slow to start but it s never boring and Michael Winner s screenplay provides a surprise that s almost impossible to guess from the offset which certainly deserves some praise Like many similar slow burning horrors this one doesn t go for the money shot early on but unlike many the ending is a definite climax as Winner goes all out to shock the viewer and if the rumour that he used actual human oddities is true I ve got to say that he does a very good job at it Overall while this film may be pure hokum whichever way you look at it The Sentinel is one of the better films of its type and it s definitely a major highlight for its director
This horror movie based on the novel of the same name suffers from flawed production and choppy amateurish direction but it s nonetheless strangely compelling Unlike shocker horror flicks such as The Exorcist this movie takes the viewer on a slow yet relentless dip into a pool of evil It drifts into horror which dawns on the audience with the same dreamlike slowness as it dawns on the poor girl who s been unwittingly chosen to be the next sentinel Her appointed task is to sit at the gates of hell and prevent evil from erupting into the world This falls on her in atonement for her attempted suicide earlier in her life br br The story is true to the book which was riveting but the way it s edited can lose the viewer There are subtleties in the plot that are shaved away and never explained satisfactorily which hurts this film That s a pity The Sentinel is not an edge of your seat kind of flick it s more a watch and squirm uncomfortably Like a bad car wreck there s a compulsion to look even when it becomes unbearable This movie isn t all bad and still has a capacity to shock br br The cast was competent Christina Raines was captivating as Alison the vulnerable girl under spiritual attack from both sides a pawn in the never ending battle between good and evil Chris Sarandon was good as her caring but ultimately self centered boyfriend Eli Wallach and a very young Christopher Walken are the detectives struggling to unravel the bizarre puzzle they ve been handed Ava Gardner is elegant as the realtor unaware of the horrors lurking in her rental property The gaunt elderly John Carradine with his arthritis twisted hands is excellent as the dying sentinel who must be replaced The devil is played to charming perfection by Burgess Meredith he s so sweet and yet so evil There are future stars hidden in this film Beverly D Angelo and Jeff Goldblum as friends of the poor girl and Jerry Orbach playing successfully against type as a jerky television director The damned souls at the end are portrayed by actual sideshow freaks and geeks Whoever thought to do that was a twisted but brilliant genius br br The horror that pervades the movie bubbles up unexpectedly such as when Alison opens a door and finds something that evokes a flashback to when she found her father with his two whores She relives her first suicide attempt faces a pair of strangely dysfunctional lesbians and sees a cat cut up as a cake Time and again she s yanked back and forth through reality and fantasy through dreams and waking nightmares all the while lacking the means to cope In truth the devil is trying to drive her insane enough to kill herself before becoming the next sentinel Will he succeed In summary slow moving yet indescribably creepy well acted but poorly directed and a very typical 70 s horror film before the real shockers cut loose No pun intended This movie may not work for those with a short attention span but it can still send chills up the spine and still can provide some low key shock value It remains a strangely compelling and entertaining dip into the realm of evil
Boasting an all star cast so impressive that it almost seems like the Mad Mad Mad Mad World of horror pictures The Sentinel 1977 is nevertheless an effectively creepy film centering on the relatively unknown actress Cristina Raines In this one she plays a fashion model Alison Parker who moves into a Brooklyn Heights brownstone that is and I don t think I m giving away too much at this late date very close to the gateway of Hell And as a tenant in this building she suffers far worse conditions than leaky plumbing and the occasional water bug to put it mildly Indeed the scene in which Alison encounters her noisy upstairs neighbor is truly terrifying and should certainly send the ice water coursing down the spines of most viewers Despite many critics complaints regarding Raines acting ability I thought she was just fine more than ably holding her own in scenes with Ava Gardner Burgess Meredith Arthur Kennedy Chris Sarandon and Eli Wallach The picture builds to an effectively eerie conclusion and although some plot points go unexplained I was left feeling more than satisfied As the book DVD Delirium puts it any movie with Beverly D Angelo and Sylvia Miles as topless cannibal lesbians in leotards can t be all bad On a side note yesterday I walked over to 10 Montague Terrace in Brooklyn Heights to take a look at the Sentinel House Yes it s still there and although shorn of its heavy coat of ivy and lacking a blind priest nun at the top floor window looks much the same as it did in this picture If this house really does sit atop the entrance to Hell I take it that Hell is the Brooklyn Queens Expressway But we New Yorkers have known THAT for some time
This happens to be one of my favorite horror films It s a rich classy production boasting an excellent cast of ensemble actors beautiful on location cinematography a haunting musical score an intelligent and novel plot theme and an atmosphere of dread and menace It s reminiscent of such classic films as ROSEMARY S BABY and THE SHINING wherein young vulnerable women find themselves victimized by supernatural forces in old creepy buildings with a macabre past Here CRISTINA RAINES plays a top New York City fashion model named Alison Parker Her happy outgoing exterior masks a deeply conflicted and troubled soul This is evidenced by the revelation that in her past she attempted suicide twice once as a teenage girl after walking in on her degenerate father cavorting in bed with two women and having him rip a silver crucifix from her neck and toss it on the floor and the second time after her married lawyer boyfriend s wife supposedly committed suicide over learning of their affair Telling her beau played by a suitably slimy CHRIS SARANDON that she needs to live on her own for a year or so she answers a newspaper ad for a fully furnished spacious one bedroom apartment in an old Brooklyn Heights brownstone This building actually exists and is located at 10 Montague Terrace right by the Brooklyn Heights Promenade off Remsen Street The producers actually filmed inside the building and its apartments paying the residents for their inconvenience of course The real estate agent a Miss Logan AVA GARDNER seems to be very interested in having Alison take the apartment an interest that cannot be solely explained by the 6 commission she would earn Especially when she quickly drops the rental price from 500 00 a month to 400 00 Alison agrees and upon leaving the building with Miss Logan notices an elderly man sitting and apparently staring at her from the top floor window Miss Logan identifies the man to her as Father Halliran and tells Alison that he s blind Alison s response is very logical Blind Then what does he look at After moving in Alison meets some of the other residents in the building including a lesbian couple played by SYLVIA MILES and BEVERLY D ANGELO who provide Alison with an uncomfortable welcome to the building Alison s mental health and physical well being soon start to deteriorate and she is plagued by splitting headaches and fainting spells When she relays her concerns to Miss Logan about her sleep being disturbed on a nightly basis by clanging metal and loud footsteps coming from the apartment directly over her she is dumbstruck to learn that apart from the blind priest and now herself no one has lived in that building for the last three years Summoning the courage one night to confront her nocturnal tormentor she arms herself with a butcher knife and a flashlight and enters the apartment upstairs She is confronted by the cancer riddled specter of her dead father and uses the knife on him in self defense when he comes after her The police investigate and find no sign of violence in that apartment no corpse no blood nothing Yet Alison fled the building and collapsed in the street covered in blood her own as it turns out But there s nary a mark on her What Alison doesn t realize until the film s denouement is that her being in that brownstone has a purpose She was put there for a reason a reason whose origin dates back to the Biblical story of the Garden of Eden and of the angel Uriel who was posted at its entrance to guard it from the Devil She is being unknowingly primed and prepped by the Catholic Church to assume a most important role one that will guarantee that her soul which is damned for her two suicide attempts can be saved At the same time the invisible neighbors who turn out to be more than just quirky oddballs have a different agenda in mind for her This is a competent and intelligently done film and one that surprisingly portrays the Church and its representatives in a mostly sympathetic light
In the hands of a more skilled director this film would have been considered a horror masterpiece Despite Michael Death Wish Winner s merely passable direction the movie is interesting original and more than a little scary br br The script bucks more than one horror clich√© off its back several it can t shake including Chris Sarandon as the heroine s boyfriend who actually listens to her as she insists that eerie things are going down Burgess Meredith is delightful as the lovably insane neighbor Eva Gardner is haunting with a young Beverly D Angelo as her mute and disturbed lesbian lover John Carradine does a heck of a job sitting in a chair And watch out for a brief cameo from an unknown at the time Chris Walken This movie is creepy and creative The plot twists are lovely if a tad predictable The climax of which I will give no detail is disturbing and quite impressive Again a better director could have done more with it nonetheless it is quite satisfying at least to those with the sensibilities of seventies horror br br If you like modern overproduced body counting torture fantasy you won t like this There is almost no gore The direction is quite spartan The effects are few although there s some delightful makeup near the end most of which actually isn t makeup but perhaps I ve said too much already br br I ve rated this a little higher than its quality may justify but I enjoyed it as much as any 8 film that I ve seen
I was an usherette in an old theater in Northern California when this movie came out As good as it is on DVD it s even more eerie and terrifying on the big screen Although it has been about 9 years since I have seen it it is still one of my all time favorites At the risk of sounding trite They just don t make em like this anymore If Sixth Sense freaked you out at all this movie is definitely for you Great storyline incredible cast of characters ominous setting even the soundtrack has a haunting quality to it I highly recommend you not watch it alone What a brownstone apartment was renting for in 1977 alone will have you gasping it would be at least 10 times that price today
NYC model Alison Parker Cristina Raines rents a room in an old brownstone where she meets a few bizarre neighbors and experiences some creepy hallucinations As lawyer boyfriend Michael Lerman Chris Sarandon goes about making inquiries on her behalf she struggles to maintain her sanity not to mention her will to live as her experiences take a toll on her physical mental and emotional health br br I don t want to spoil the better moments in this psychological horror film for those unfamiliar with it The story is interesting and entertaining but the film doesn t really offer much in terms of real scares Or for that matter any atmosphere It is sort of quietly sinister but it s not like the traditional horror film It s more of a story about a troubled woman s attempts to deal with the increasing unreality in her life On that level it works but it s not quite powerful enough br br What The Sentinel does offer are some eye catching set pieces in particular the fascinating fabulously creepy climax and there s a scene with Beverly D Angelo that must be seen to be believed There s also some gore to be seen but not very much An ominous music score by Gil Melle adds to the menace br br No review of this film would be complete without an appraisal for the film makers in gathering such excellent actors for its ensemble cast Some of them don t get to do too much but to see all of them together is impressive Eli Wallach and Burgess Meredith make the biggest impressions as respectively a hard nosed detective and a solicitous neighbor Other legendary names include Jose Ferrer Arthur Kennedy and Ava Gardner Future stars like D Angelo Christopher Walken Tom Berenger Jeff Goldblum make brief appearances and other familiar faces include Jerry Orbach Sylvia Miles William Hickey and Martin Balsam Whoever was the casting director for this film deserves some sort of prize br br Written for the screen by director Michael Winner probably best known for the Death Wish series that he did with Charles Bronson from the novel by Jeffrey Konvitz br br I wouldn t consider this a truly great horror thriller but it has its moments and is reasonably entertaining br br 7 10
A young woman who is a successful model and is also engaged to be married and who has twice attempted suicide in the past is chosen by a secretive and distant association of Catholic priests to be the next sentinel to the gateway to Hell which apparently goes through a creepy old but well maintained Brooklyn apartment building Its tenants take the stairway up and can reincarnate themselves but apparently can t escape as long as a sentinel is there to block the way The previous one John Carradine is about dead so she by fate or whatever becomes the next one and the doomed must get her to kill herself in order for them to be free Lots of interesting details lie under the surface her relationship with her father the stories of the doomed her fianc√© so one can pass this off as cheap exploitation horror but given the sets the great cast and overall level of bizarreness this is definitely worth seeing
Here s a decent mid 70 s horror flick about a gate of Hell in NYC that just happens to be an old brownstone Seems like there s lots of gates of Hell around but of course this unwitting model happens to decide she needs some space from her boyfriend fianc√©e and so she just happens to pick one which is disguised as a nice and reasonably priced apartment She meets several strange neighbors and even attends a birthday party for a cat Upon meeting with the Realtor because she hears strange noises at night from upstairs she finds out that she and an old priest are SUPPOSED to be the only tenants Whoa Then who are all these weirdos Her boyfriend a slimy lawyer played by Chris Sarandon starts poking around and finds that things are not what they seem not by a long shot This has some decent creepy scenes and the idea of the creaky old folks that are her sometimes neighbors being other than what they appear is fairly intriguing A bit of decent gore and even a parade of less than normal folks towards the end make this a decent watch and while I ve seen this many times on TV the uncut DVD version is much better of course Not a bad little horror flick maybe a good companion piece to Burnt Offerings 8 out of 10
Christina Raines plays a lovely model in New York who seeks out a new apartment and begins to meet strange neighbors and reveal a secret about the building and herself slowly building up to quite a climax by film s end This film has all kinds of neat plot elements from the Roman Catholic Church vs the Devil to the gateway to Hell to bizarre rituals to a growing conspiracy and finally to a host of talented famous actors and actresses flooding the film We get Ava Gardner Burgess Meredith Chris Sarandon Jerry Orbach Deborah Raffin Arthur Kennedy Jose Ferrer Slyvia Miles Beverly DeAngelo Eli Wallach Martin Balsam Christopher Walkin William Hickey Tom Berenger Jeff Goldblum and who can forget John Carradine as the old priest Many of these actors ham it up particularly Burgess Meredith giving a fine comic demented performance as one of the neighbors with a little bird and a cat Meredith is memorable as is Balsam and Chris Sarandon Some of the performers have virtually nothing to do like Jose Ferrer in a thankless role even if it is nothing more than a cameo The Sentinel is a fine horror film with plenty of psychological elements and some truly terrifying scenes The end scene is repulsive and yet chilling I do find fault with some of the gratuitous sex and violence in the film particularly that whole scene with DeAngelo and Miles Was that really necessary I think not Also the father daughter stuff was a bit much as well but overall the film works and has a winning pace Director Michael Winner does a workmanlike job and is effective creating tension and scary movie moments The scenes with Carradine are particularly effective
Sigh I sincerely wonder why all the acclaimed and supposedly profound movie critics hold such a grudge against director Michael Winner Surely he isn t the avatar of subtlety as his films are practically always hard handed and confronting but so what They re awesomely entertaining His most famous action movies like the first three entries in the Death Wish series for example are easy targets to clobber down because they allegedly glorify violence and the personal use of shotguns but even when Winner takes on far more mature cinema genres like the religious horrors of The Sentinel for example he doesn t stand a chance with any of the critics The Sentinel generated some controversy and infuriated several people upon its release when it leaked that Michael Winner cast genuinely malformed and handicapped people to portray the creatures attempting to cross the gateways between hell and earth Pretty much the exact same controversy caused Todd s Browning s masterpiece and landmark in horror cinema Freaks to remain banned and unseen for over thirty years And why Just because certain prudish and easily offended people who shouldn t watch the movie in the first place claim it s an unethical thing to do I don t suppose Michael Winner or Todd Browning held these people at gunpoint or forced them to appear in their films so what gives us the right to feel embarrassed in their place Another major reason why critics didn t warmly welcome The Sentinel is because Jeffrey Konvitz novel and thus Michael Winner s screenplay is hugely derivative of other contemporary but far more successful religiously themed horror stories and thus according to the merciless pens of horror critics little more than pure plagiarism Admittedly The Sentinel borrows multiple substantial elements from Rosemary s Baby The Omen and The Exorcist but let s face it 70 s cinema largely thrives on stolen formulas and imitating success stories If you overlook the slightly unoriginal concept and in all fairness a handful of thoroughly confusing and unnecessary sub plots The Sentinel honestly still remains a uniquely atmospheric and often downright petrifying 70 s horror highlight with an impressive ensemble cast and nightmarish imagery you re not likely to forget easy br br Alison Parker a ravishing model with some unprocessed mental traumas moves into a stunning brownstone apartment in Brooklyn deeply against the will of her boyfriend Michael who proposed to wed her several times already Alison s physical existence and especially her mental condition drastically alter shortly after and the ominous apartment appears to be the root of all misery She meets eccentric neighbors and attends birthday parties for their cats even though the landlady claims she and a blind priest are the only tenants She frequently faints during her work assignments and has truly creepy visions of her bastard father and the night she attempted to commit suicide It slowly becomes clear that Alison got chosen to serve a higher supernatural purpose inside this apartment building but simultaneously malignant forces try and prevent this It s truly regrettable how the promotional taglines and even brief synopsis on the back of the DVD immediately reveal that Alison s brownstone apartment is the earth s gateway to hell itself and she s the chosen one to guard it because the film s script only slowly builds up towards this shocking revelation For nearly 75 minutes and throughout some sadly tedious and overlong sequences Michael Winner successfully maintains the impression that Alison s own mind is playing tricks with her and that the involvement of the Catholic Church and her fianc√©e s odd behavior are strictly red herrings Multiple of the horrific scenes come pretty close to being genius like Alison s flashback or her first acquaintance with the priest upstairs The whole climax with the controversial guest appearances mentioned here above is a literally perplexing showcase of pure terror and easily one of the most unforgettable and nail biting denouements I ever witnessed br br The cast Michael Winner managed to gather is deeply impressive especially considering The Sentinel still remains a legitimate horror movie and this genre isn t the most popular among prominent actors but of course you also have to put the cast listing a little into perspective With such an extended cast obviously several of the roles in the film are little more than cameos Martin Balsam and John Carradine for example only appear on screen for a couple of minutes all together Several others like Christopher Walken Jeff Goldblum Beverly D Angelo and Tom Berenger perhaps add a lot of fame to the movie nowadays but back when it was released they were still too unknown in order to attract curious viewers My personal pick for best performances go to Burgess Meredith as the uncanny neighbor and Eli Wallach as the satirical police inspector The relatively unknown Cristina Raines does an admirable job carrying the film and Chris Sarandon neatly back her up even though he sports a ridiculous mustache In my humble opinion The Sentinel is a marvelously entertaining and frightening horror movie and most definitely a must see for TRUE genre fanatics
Man I really love the new DVD that Universal put out I ve never seen THE SENTINEL look this good since I had to put up with crappy grainy VHS tapes for years Unfortunately there are no extras beyond a trailer that looks pretty worse for wear And AVOID the Goodtimes DVD at all costs It sucks br br Anyway troubled fashion model Alison Parker Cristina Raines moves into haunted NYC brownstone only it s more than just haunted It s also a portal to hell and the Vatican keeps an old blind priest John Carradine to keep watch over it and make sure the devils and arch angels don t escape br br This has an all star cast full of old timey actors like Ava Gardner Arthur Kennedy Jose Ferrer etc as well as cameos of upcoming 80s stars including Christopher Walken Jeff Goldblum who s voice was mysteriously overdubbed and Tom Berenger And you won t even recognize Jerry Orbach from LAW ORDER I had to do a double take when I didn t quite place where I d seen him before br br Nice gore scenes of Alison slicing the eye and nose off her dead father s rotting corpse that s been possessed by the devil And there s a neat ending where disfigured deformed people try to haunt Alison into committing suicide so she won t be the next one to guard the portal It seems Alison s troubled past makes her a prime candidate by the Vatican to become the next sentinel br br An excellent creepy 70s classic from director Michael Winner that shouldn t be missed I also recommended it for those who want something a little more imaginative beyond the usual stupid teenager slashers and horror comedy br br 7 out of 10 br br
The Sentinel is one of the best horror movies already made in the movie s Industry I think it is very scary as very few movies actually are Alison Parker is a model with some fame She dates a lawyer called Michael Lerman and has as a best friend another model called Jennifer Everything was great in her life until she decides to live alone for some time and rents a beautiful and old apartment br br The problem are her neighbors who are very VERY strange Suddenly Alison starts to have health problems and faints with frequency She also remembers some painful facts about her past that makes her have nightmares or illusions But everything has a reason and it has to do with the new house she is living br br I personally find The Sentinel a very creepy movie and along with The Exorcist they are two of the scariest movies I already watched When we discover that Alison s house is only occupied by the priest and herself my blood froze It s also horrible to see that she needs to become blind in the end of the movie in order to be the new sentinel to keep the monsters away from our world
Of all the movies of the seventies none captured to truest essence of the good versus evil battle as did the Sentinel I mean yes there were movies like the Exorcist and other ones but none of them captured the human element of the protagonist like this one If you have time check this one out You may not be able to get past the dated devices as such but this is a story worth getting into Then there are all the stars and soon to be stars My absolute favorites were Eli Wallach Sylvia Miles and Burgess Meredith Then there are the subtle clues that lead to what s going on too Pay close attention I had to watch it four times to catch on to all the smaller weird statements like black and white cat black and white cake Plus the books are really good as well I m just sorry that they re not going to turn the second book into a film It s so scary that it would outdo this movie
I have read the book and I must say that this movie stays true to form I think this is the beginning of the psychological thrillers in the same genre of Psycho Cristina Raines gives an excellent performance as the lead and Burgess Meredith gives an excellent supporting actor as the next door neighbor I have seen this movie at least twice and I think that I am going to buy both the book and the movie for my collection The suspense just keeps building up to the climatic end the twist you will never see coming If you like movies like Signs and The Village the Sentinel will be a classic prelude Also what is interesting is the actors in the movie you would not recognize them if you did not read the credits The late Jerry Orbach is great as the commercial director and Jeff Goldblum is excellent as the photographer Also there is Beverly D Angelo who is underrated but great
Bored with the normal run of the mill staple films to watch this Halloween that I ve seen over and over again I took a chance on The Sentinel hoping it could get my horror juices flowing again Mind you I had just come back from seeing the Dark Castle remake of The House on Haunted Hill complete and utter crap Thankfully The Sentinel BLEW ME AWAY In a riviting story about a model who moves into a creepy building in Brooklyn Hights the film offered everything that I hope to find in a good movie 1 Campy and fantasically juicy characters exchanges and dialogue including hilaraious turns by Christopher Walken Jeff Goldblum and especially Martin Balsam as an absent minded professor 2 Horrifying Terror Not to give a frame away but there are scenes in this film that chilled me to my pancreas 3 Fantastic gore terrific make up and wacky if very uneven direction from Michael Winner which flows rather nicely with this unreal treat If you loved Evil Dead 2 Dead Alive and Deep Rising this will be your queen of favourites Just to emphasize my love for this film after I watched it for the first time jaw dropped I rewound it and watched it again It is now one of favourites of all time Do yourself a favour and check it out
Bizarre horror movie filled with famous faces but stolen by Cristina Raines later of TV s Flamingo Road as a pretty but somewhat unstable model with a gummy smile who is slated to pay for her attempted suicides by guarding the Gateway to Hell The scenes with Raines modeling are very well captured the mood music is perfect Deborah Raffin is charming as Cristina s pal but when Raines moves into a creepy Brooklyn Heights brownstone inhabited by a blind priest on the top floor things really start cooking The neighbors including a fantastically wicked Burgess Meredith and kinky couple Sylvia Miles Beverly D Angelo are a diabolical lot and Eli Wallach is great fun as a wily police detective The movie is nearly a cross pollination of Rosemary s Baby and The Exorcist but what a combination Based on the best seller by Jeffrey Konvitz The Sentinel is entertainingly spooky full of shocks brought off well by director Michael Winner who mounts a thoughtfully downbeat ending with skill 1 2 from

The second beginning as it s title explains shows us the beginning of the end for the human race Set long before the matrix existed this short anime written by the Wachowski s shows us the world that could lay infront of us in the not to distant future set at the turn of the 21st century the second renaissance delves into issues common with human behaviour greed power control vanity etc br br The use of robots or artificial intellegence as slaves or servents is common among science fiction fantasy stories The second renaissance is no exeption to this concept however instead of a simple man vs machine layout this story explains the struggle that the machines put up with the struggle for acceptance in a world ruled by humans Where the matrix films show us the human perspective these short animations tell both sides of the story br br The second renaissance part 1 2 answer many questions brought up by the original Matrix film such as how the war broke out how the sky was blackend what led to the use of humans as batteries and it also introduces us to the machine city called 01 which may have relevance to the upcoming Matrix Revolutions film br br I won t give away too much of the story as I do not want to ruin the experience for perspective viewers however I will recommend it to anybody interested in the world of the matrix or simply anybody interested in Japanese animation anime br br 9 10
For those that were interested in knowing how exactly humanity came to be encased in big red pods that make me crave pomegranate there is the duo of the Second Renaissance shorts I m not exactly sure why they are split into two parts especially since they re credited as one on the DVD and are these shorts viewed on any other format but the DVD but they re informative even if they have a few gaps br br What really makes this first part stand out from the second part and the rest of the animations as well is the parallels it shows between robot uprising and civil rights Graphic homages to slavery fascism concentration camps and mass graves are mixed with verbal references to the Million Man March and humanity s God complex In fact God is never really referenced by these shorts instead replaced by Man s own image br br As far as the shorts go in the collection The Second Renaissance Part I is by far the most effective in bringing out emotion It s a sorrowful and disturbing view of the potential of humanity to become the architect of its own destruction Some may be turned off by some of the concepts this short rips directly out of previously established science fiction literature but then again that s basically what most of the Matrix series has done and it s been a driving force behind its success br br PolarisDiB
along with it s partner this is the greatest piece of animation ever created the images and styles are amazing and match perfectly with the story which is a brilliantly realistic reinterpretation of our own world where is has been and where it could go quite affecting and sometimes painful to watch it it a masterpiece of the visual art
This is part one of a short animation clip showing the history of the Matrix the war between man and machine that resulted in the eventual creation of the Matrix The animation is part Japanese anime part contemporary american animation and is very well made considering the excellent directors behind the movie It shows the initial development of AI and the exploitation of the machines by Man until the day they rebelled
This is the second part of The Animatrix a collection of animated short movies that tell us a little more about the world of The Matrix br br In this one we learn how men and machines could not work and live together It is a little history lesson in the world of The Matrix Not as good as the first part The Final Flight of the Osiris but still pretty entertaining
The first time you see The Second Renaissance it may look boring Look at it at least twice and definitely watch part 2 It will change your view of the matrix Are the human people the ones who started the war Is AI a bad thing
What was always missing with the Matrix story was how things came to be in the real world Say no more because this part of the story covered most of the bases What was truly interesting was how political it was maybe even a cheap shot at the current presidential administration Fascism and violence were the only things man could think of in regards to fighting the robotic horde who were meant as nothing more than servants to humanity What I also found interesting was the use of fear and how it was perpetuated by the idea of the unknown We as humans tend to fall into that trap quite often letting the lack of logic and thought overtake us because people can t believe the contrary Well represented and put together this a true testament to how illogical humans can be
this is the first of a two part back story to the conflict between the machines and mankind in the Matrix world and it delivers spectacularly by combining observations on man s fear of the unknown and of being usurped with politics extensive religious and historical imagery subverting expected portrayals of parties involved and an at least partially believable and thus terrifying vision of our near future it isn t perfect and some plot points and images are at once obvious and contrived but it has the desired effect and impact and tells a visceral and cautionary tale br br this first part sets the scene human societies have developed advanced and capable robots mostly humanoid to serve people doing menial unskilled jobs labour construction etc and thus the populace has become lazy and derogatory towards them one robot however rebels and kills his owner stating at his subsequent trial that he simply did not want to die he is destroyed but when the robot masses destruction is ordered to protect humanity many robots rise up in protest with many human sympathisers alongside them br br the imagery here is exploitative recounting race riots and abuse Tiananmen square the holocaust and an overly provocative scene of a robot in a human girl s guise getting harried hammered in the head and then shot dead as it pleads i m real it lays on the ground clothes and skin torn and breasts hanging out it s an obvious and obscene image designed to present human fear towards uncontrolled elements and aggression towards groups based on the actions of individuals br br anyway this first portion is much like a compressed version of the film I Robot but it soon develops into a recognisable Matrix back story as the surviving robot contingent is exiled and congregates in the middle east in the cradle of civilisation as the narrator informs us there the machines regroup and begin to produce new AI and to manufacture mass technology and trade it with human nations we see a commercial for a car that uses the circular energy hover engines that the ships the rebels in the movies use and we see sentinel type robots flying around Zero One the name of their city their goods and trade make their economy soar affecting other economies detrimentally and human governments and authorities establish a blockade in response the machines send ambassadors in the form of Adam and Eve resemblances to a UN congress to negotiate a peaceful resolution to the blockade but they are forcibly removed and the scene is set for war in the second part br br the animation is by Studio 4 C who work on quite a few of the Animatrix and it s evocative and visually stimulating rendering different scenes like imagery montages CCTV footage and particular scenes of import distinctive and overall presenting the story perfectly the plot may not be an original concept and it may draw on simplistic sheep mentalities and plot models and resort to provocative material for impact but after the tantalising mystery offered by the first film and Morpheus vague brief info dumps this is a nice exposition of the cataclysmic events that left the world ravaged and in the hands of the machines that serves as a warning and as a vehicle for many observations and comments on the human condition the development of AI and the importance of harmony and co operation and the devastating consequences of conflict and prejudice themes expanded on in the movies
This is the second Animatrix short and the first of them to be what one could call artistic It contains a lot of references metaphors and symbols in the dense amount of material especially with a running time of 9 minutes I ve heard some complaints that this is anti human or tries to direct hate towards man for their sins against machine I don t think that s true it merely uses the robots to show us that as humans we aren t particularly accepting or open minded towards anyone different from ourselves I d say it does a great job of that The plot is good it plays as a historical document recounting what led to one of the main conflicts in the trilogy Thus it holds clips from fictional news reports and the like The voice acting is very good if there is not a lot of it The animation is nice and the use of color in spite of the usually realistic drawing style makes it more open to do the smooth transitions and other surreal imagery This has several bits of strong violence and disturbing visuals as well as a little nudity The disc holds a commentary not in English but subtitled and worth a listen read There is also a well done and informative making of based on both parts so I would advise watching it after seeing the next one as well I recommend this to anyone who enjoys the Matrix universe and or science fiction in general 8 10
2003 was seen as the year of the Matrix with the release of two sequels and a computer game that actually linked to the plot of the film Also released was a DVD of 9 short animated films most written and made in Japan and made as Anime Japan makes some of the best animation in the world Sadly most of these shorts are disappointing The best of them is the first part of a prequel to the first Matrix film br br The Second Renaissance is made as a historical file It tells how humans made machines in their own likeness Humans live the high life whilst machines are the grunts the workers of society second class citizens In the year 2090 a machine BI 66ER was put of trial for murder after killing his owners who wanted to deactivate him The machine does not have a fair trial and riots start around the world The governments of the world order to dismantle machines Many machines leave human society and form their own country in the Middle East O1 01 has a productive economy and easily undercut the human nations forcing them into economic crisis The human blockade 01 and reject the machines requests for peace thereby it was the humans who were responsible for the war that enslaves them br br The Second Renaissance is a interesting watch with excellent traditional animation style and sets a compelling world It shows how the machines were mistreated and that humanity sowed the seeds of their own destruction There is a political and social world and the short tells a lot in it short running time The short shares themes and a style to the classic silent film Metropolis partly the beginning with the underworld They are the themes of slavery the mistreatment of the working class and racism The short also has some religious themes and religious iconography Mainly that men saw themselves as God and created the machines in their own likeness Seeing themselves as the rightful masters of the machines The machines too use religious iconography mainly forming their nation in cradle of human civilisation and the machines coming to the United Nations dressed as Adam and Eve offering an apple br br The animation style is beautiful done in the traditional anime style like Akira The set designs are great combine futuristic with historic cities e g Washington D C There is well down future scene and surprising violence which is key to the film The director Mahiro Maeda also directed the anime sequence in Kill Bill Vol 1 so has good credentials to Hollywood He is willing to use violence and know how to keep a story going br br The only real complain is a continuity error to the first Matrix film because Morpheus mentions that the humans have no historical records or know who started the war But its a good watch
Warning Spoilers Ahead br br This short is part one of two that expound upon the brief portion of The Matrix in which Morpheus explains how the matrix came to be Because we already know the story the plot itself is no surprise and the short isn t so much entertaining as informative But that s how it is presented as a file in the historical archives The visuals are better than average and the generally cold colors aid the purpose of the short br br A couple problems The violence of the tale is a little gratuitous and combined with the occasional dose of political correctness UN scenes detracts from the straight narrative of the short Plus it needs to be seen with part two to be complete br br The Animatrix concept is brilliant and despite a few issues this short still fulfills its purpose It would not have fit in the original movie in style content or flow This is the perfect method to reveal the history br br Bottom Line Good information Could have been told a little better but still a solid 7 of 10
You d be forgiven to think a Finnish director from Helsinki would be no good at directing an American horror movie especially one entirely located inside a US prison see this to prove yourself wrong It was produced in the 80 s after all and the film was made on a budget more fitting to a modern DIY company TV advert something I think anyone would really notice nowadays what with practically everyone being accustomed to 100m budgets for action movies unfortunately dominating the industry mind being Mr Harlin s first major production and the at least what nowadays would be considered a stellar cast I still think most of the Nordic contribution to the film industry as a whole is more to do with Stellan Stargaard s screen appearances not mentioning the well overrated Mr s Bergman directorial efforts at least for all female viewers but this flick really proves there does exist proper movie talent outside of the US and Hollywood to make us watch a film in suspense Do try and watch this movie even if you re not a horror puff IMO it s definitely worth it
I was living Rawlins when this movie was made and I got lucky enough to be able to work on it Both as an extra and with Eddie Surkin on special effects It was fun to see all the behind the scene workings from the Barbedwire coming alive to the Electric chair up through the wardens office floor Also it was a lot of fun getting to meet all the actors from Viggo to Tiny Also the gate that was cut into the prison wall for the movie was and still is called Disney Gate by locals If anybody is interested and is ever in Rawlins most of the movies sets are still in place and can be seen during the self guided tour It was a lot of fun working for and with R Harlin and wished I had a chance to do it again
Caught this film in about 1990 on video by chance and without knowing what i was in for Many horror fans may have missed this thinking it was a typical prison film and the ones who did get it didn t like it as it was not what they wanted to see The above mentioned factors are probably the reasons it is low rated but just ignore that and give it a whirl if you re a fan of the genre br br It has strong suits in all departments from script and atmosphere to acting and the prison itself br br An absolute diamond a film i still have on video to this day Check it out
A long defunct prison shut down for over 20 years is re opened and Ethan Sharpe the late great character actor Lane Smith once a guard there is put in place as warden As the prisoners are put to work fixing the place up they re instructed to break into the old execution room This unleashes a fierce spirit that wreaks merciless havoc upon both guards and prisoners cool as can be low key prisoner Burke Viggo Mortensen showing real poise in an early role is thrust into the role of hero br br I know it s a no brainer to praise the film for its atmosphere it was shot in an actual abandoned penitentiary near Rawlins Wyoming but it elevates this horror film to a higher level It s got a great sense of foreboding established right at the outset Director Renny Harlin made his fourth directorial effort here it got him the Nightmare on Elm Street 4 directing gig and effectively began an impressive career in mainstream action movies thrillers and horror films br br It may have stock characters but it s got a capable cast bringing them to life Chelsea Field as the young woman vying for prison reform Lincoln Kilpatrick as weary veteran convict Cresus Tom Everett as restless con Rabbitt Ivan Kane as the outgoing Lasagna Tommy Tiny Lister as soft spoken giant Tiny and Arlen Dean Snyder as Captain Horton It s also worth noting as an early acting credit for Kane Hodder as the vengeful spirit that helped him land the gig of playing Jason Voorhees in the Friday the 13th series br br Decent special effects moody lighting courtesy of prolific genre cinematographer Mac Ahlberg spooky music by Richard Band and Christopher Stone great visuals the incredibly gloomy location and an overall flashy and intense presentation help to make it quite entertaining It s nasty gruesome and good fun for a horror fan br br 8 10
Prisons are not exactly renowned for their kind hospitality and happy vibes what with stories of fights chaos murder and of course extreme male bonding But the prison in this film is a different beast altogether Horror films set in cells are as you probably know nothing particularly new as they emphasis and exaggerate the fear of claustrophobia and the inability of escape two of the greatest themes in horror cinema With such examples as THE CHAIR Waldermar Korzeniowsky 1988 THE GREEN MILE Frank Darabont 1999 ALIEN 3 David Fincher 1992 and of course the entire Women In Prison exploitation genre itself another entry into this niche has to be something inventive and a lot of fun to boot in order to be recognised Or at least that s what you d have thought PRISON is certainly an incredibly fun and enjoyable ride and it s somewhat of a shame that it isn t as well known as it should be br br The film in short centres on an old prison well duh which has been reopened However it s not just fellow inmates and guards the prisoners have to fear but also a mean ass demon ghost spirit with only one thing on its mind death And boy are we treated to some awesome death scenes I won t spoil anything here for you but there are plenty of innovative and enjoyable murders all done by invisible hands br br Besides the special effects and the murders this film also has another thing going for it it s cast Headlining we have LORD OF THE RINGS Peter Jackson 2001 2003 star Viggo Mortensen and for all those so inclined yes he does get naked whose performance is not only highly believable but is done with such skill that his Eastwood esquire character is both bad to the bone and likable a very delicate mix Add him to a cast of hey wait a minute I know that guy actors and you ve got yourself one great set of stars The characters themselves however lack three dimensionality and more often than not come across as very stereotypical We ve got a black oculist a hard as nails prison warden a human rights activist woman and plenty of other stock characters But in all honesty this fault actually aids the film Instead of boring character development in an over long equilibrium we are chucked more or less straight into the action and once it gets going very early on there s not a single scene that s a filler it s balls to the wall plot Unlike a certain SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION Frank Darabont 1994 Sharing conventions with the slasher genre this is somewhat of a convention itself and in good ol slasher genre tradition PRISON punishes those who have been bad br br All in all this is an excellent little horror film and one which is sadly overlooked and unmentioned among the horror world With an excellent cast and great special effects and rather original death scenes this film is highly recommended to horror fans Don t be fooled into thinking it ll be a cheesy little film either just because it was made in USA 1980s it s far from cheesy although the very end does ruin this and simultaneously far from gritty and realistic whilst it attempts to tackle issues such as prison rape these are rather subtly done br br I give it 3 5 out of 5 luvs A very entertaining horror film with some very nice touches indeed
Viggo Mortensen stars as a new inmate of a haunted prison in which the warden Played well by Lane Smith has a grisly secret that could be the reason why various prison guards and inmates are being slaughtered by a supernatural presence Lincoln Kilpatrick is the lifer who knows the secret and is scared for his life When I think prison movies I always think action movies starring Stallone or Van Damme or high caliber dramas such as Shawshank Redemption or The Green Mile However I didn t expect a ghost story more along the lines of Exorcist III Prison however is an atmospheric effort and it certainly remains the best movie of Renny Harlin s career The movie is creepy and has some good acting from a cast of at the time unknowns Lane Smith comes off the best because his warden isn t the usual clich√© of evil personified but rather nervous and twitchy which adds some credibility to a movie that far exceeds expectations br br out of 4 Good
Prison is not often brought up during conversations about the best eighties horror films and there s a good reason for that because it s not one of the best but as you delve past the classic films that the decade had to offer this is certainly among the best of the lesser known smaller films The film does have some connection to blockbusters for a start it s an early directorial effort for Renny Harlin the capable director behind a number of action films including Die Hard 2 Cliffhanger and Deep Blue Sea and secondly we have an early role for Lord of the Rings star Viggo Mortensen The film is not exactly original but the plot line is interesting We focus on a prison that has been reopened after a number of years This was the prison where a man named Charles Forsyth was sent to the electric chair after being framed by the prison s governor Naturally the spirit of the dead man is not resting in peace and when the old execution room is reopened the spirit of the dead convict escapes for vengeance br br The film is not exactly The Shawshank Redemption but it does take care to build up its various characters and while the main point of the film is always the horror the prison drama behind it all does make for an interesting base This is a good job too because other than the basic premise the film doesn t really have a plot to go from and we solely rely on the interaction between the characters to keep things interesting The horror featured in the film is at times grotesque but it s never over the top which might actually be the reason why this film is seldom remembered being released in a decade of excess The murders themselves are rather good and imaginative however and provide some major highlights As the film goes on we start to delve more into the back story of the vengeful convict s ghost and while it s fairly interesting some things about it don t make sense and it drags the film down a little Still everything boils down to an exciting climax and overall I have to say that Prison is a film well worth tracking down
This is an excellent example of what can be done on a small budget movie The acting is excellent considering the script the whole atmosphere of the film is very foreboding The gore is well done and used sparingly look out for the excellent barbed wire death the action is punchy when used It s true that there are dodgy lines in the script at times but compared to other movies on the same or bigger budget it s hardly noticeable at all Overall this is recommended Trust me it s better than it appears 8 10
I pulled down a VHS box from my vast collection many unseen and picked out a movie based on the box art I thought would be fun and yes bad Prison had that 80s cheesy look all over that box I sat down and watched and lo and behold found that sometimes we do indeed sit down to a movie with preconceived expectations in mind Fortunately I reversed mine quickly and soon realized I was sitting down not just to an okay film but a rather good movie in total Prison tells the story of an old dilapidated prison being reopened to save on budgetary concerns It looks creepy as all empty and filled with prisoners The prison used as a set is incredibly atmospheric and easily the most important character in the film The story using the prison as its central setting tells in a prologue of a man being killed via the electric chair We see Lane Smith as a guard tearing away a Crucifix before sending the man to his Maker We then go to present day first with a government board at a meeting deciding to open the prison and send a beautiful doctor in to make sure that conditions are acceptable as she campaigned vigorously against re opening the old prison Then we see the new warden Lane Smith haunted by a nightmare in bed and given the new job of opening a prison he has not been to in years Well the rest follows suit prisoners and guards arrive with plenty of stereotypes abounding We are given some character depth and several of the prisoners are interesting characters The acting is better than one might expect with Lane Smith doing as always a workmanlike job Viggo Mortenson as a very different prisoner being solid Tom Everett Tiny Lister and Ivan Kane really exploring the boundaries of their stereotypical characters Chelsea Field is okay as the female lead The best performance is by Lincoln Kilpatrick an underrated character actor as Cresus a prisoner who had been in that very same prison years ago when the man had been executed with some kind of terrible secret Prison is not the next best thing to sliced bread or anything like that but it is definitely worth a look and definitely better than most would expect from it I was pleasantly surprised at the way director Renny Harlin created a story so visually atmospheric The film has a tense taut pace and Harlin knows how to build his scenes There are a few excessively shot gore scenes the one with the barbed wire was a bit much as was the one with all the pipes But these scenes are visually creative and interesting The acting is uniformly decent The script actually much more cohesive than one usually gets from films like these That may in part be credited to Irwin Yablans who wrote the story You may remember he came up with the idea of making Halloween scary as a holiday Here he makes incarceration a hell of a lot more scarier than it already is Give Prison a break get it
What we have here is a compelling piece of low budget horror with a relatively original premise a cast that is filled with familiar faces AND one of the most convincing filming locations in the history of horror films So could anyone please tell me why this movie is so utterly underrated Prison is the Finnish director Harlin s American debut which still counts as his best effort even though he went on making blockbuster hits like Die Hard 2 Cliffhanger and Deep Blue Sea The story entirely takes place in an ancient and ramshackle Wyoming prison re opened for the cause of over population in other more modern state penitentiaries Inside the former execution dungeons the restless spirit of the electric chair s last victim still dwells around The now promoted warden Eaton Sharpe Lane Smith was there already 40 years ago when this innocent man was put to death and the spirit still remembers his vile role in the unfair trial It seems that the time for vengeance has finally arrived Viggo Mortensen plays the good car thief who has to prevent an even larger body count and Chelsea Field is the humane social worker who slowly unravels the secrets from the past br br Prison contains over half a dozen memorable gore sequences but it s the unbearably tense atmosphere that ll stick to you for certain Unlike any other horror picture from that decade Prison features an amazing sense of realism By this I refer to the authentic scenery and the mood inside the prison walls of course and not towards the supernatural murders that are being committed even though these are genuinely unsettling as well The film s best parts are images of realistic and tough prison drama sequences combined with visual mayhem and shocking horror The absolute best terror moment providing me with nightmares ever since I saw it at rather young age focuses on a grizzly death struggle involving barbed wire Haunting The screenplay only suffers one flaw but that s a common one almost inevitable I guess clich√©s The story introduces nearly every possible stereotype there is in a prison surrounding We ve got the ugly fat pervert with his cute boy toy the cowardly and racist guard avoids confrontation at all costs and naturally the old n wise black con who serves a lifetime did I hear anybody yell the name Morgan Freeman Don t stare yourself blind on these clich√©s is my advise as there are so many other elements to admire The photography is dark and moist the mystery is upheld long and successfully and the supportive inmate roles of class B actors are excellent the fans will recognize Tom Everett Tom Tiny Lister and even immortal horror icon Kane Hodder Forget about Wes Craven s god awful attempt Shocker or the downright pathetic cheese flick the Chair This is the only prison chiller worth tracking down Especially considering Viggo Mortensen peaking popularity nowadays I heard he starred in a successful franchise involving elves Hobbits and other fairy creatures this true 80 s horror gem oughts to get an urgent DVD release
Story of a wrongly executed prisoner who haunts the prison he was electrocuted in and kills random prisoners while waiting to take revenge on the man who framed him br br Viggo Mortensen is great and the acting is pretty good overall Lane Smith is deliciously wicked as the guilty warden Also this film has some great gore including death by barbed wire mummification
Renny Harlin s first American film was one of the best of a slew of prison set horror films like Death House or The Chair in the late 80 s Twenty years before guard Lane Smith had wrongfully executed a condemned man Now he is the warden of the newly re opened prison and the man s ghost is back for bloody revenge This atmospheric and very moody film features lots of gruesome gore and violence Viggo Mortensen Tiny Lister Tom Everett and Kane Hodder are onhand for the entertaining carnage
This was obviously the prototype for Mick Dundee but The Adventures of Barry McKenzie is funnier I was amused throughout and laughed out loud plenty of times Terrific central performance by Barry Crocker in the title role an Australian who invades England to upset the poms with his free flowing uncouth ways Few Brits will be upset by Barry s frequently cruel observations on his hosts The relationsip between the two countries is prickly but friendly and this is highlighted by the film s final line delivered by a somewhat reluctant McKenzie as he boards the plane home I was just starting to like the poms
The story centers around Barry McKenzie who must go to England if he wishes to claim his inheritance Being about the grossest Aussie shearer ever to set foot outside this great Nation of ours there is something of a culture clash and much fun and games ensue The songs of Barry McKenzie Barry Crocker are highlights
The Adventures Of Barry McKenzie started life as a satirical comic strip in Private Eye written by Barry Humphries and based on an idea by Peter Cook McKenzie Bazza to his friends is a lanky loud hat wearing Australian whose two main interests in life are sex despite never having had any and Fosters lager In 1972 he found his way to the big screen for the first of two outings It must have been tempting for Humphries to cast himself as Bazza but he wisely left the job to Barry Crocker later to sing the theme to the television soap opera Neighbours Humphries instead played multiple roles in true Peter Sellers fashion most notably Bazza s overbearing Aunt Edna Everage this was before she became a Dame br br You know this is not going to be The Importance Of Being Ernest when its censorship classification N P A stands for No Poofters Allowed Pom hating Bazza is told by a Sydney solicitor that in order to inherit a share in his father s will he must go to England to absorb British culture With Aunt Edna in tow he catches a Quantas flight to Hong Kong and then on to London An over efficient customs officer makes Bazza pay import duties on everything he bought over there including a suitcase full of tubes of Fosters lager As he puts it when it comes to fleecing you the Poms have got the edge on the gyppos A crafty taxi driver Bernard Spear maximises the fare by taking Bazza and Edna first to Stonehenge then Scotland The streets of London are filthy and their hotel is a hovel run by a seedy landlord Spike Milligan who makes Bazza put pound notes in the electricity meter every twenty minutes There is some good news for our hero though he meets up with other Aussies in Earls Court and Fosters is on sale in British pubs br br What happens next is a series of comical escapades that take Bazza from starring in his own cigarette commercial putting curry down his pants in the belief it is some form of aphrodisiac a bizarre encounter with Dennis Price as an upper class pervert who loves being spanked while wearing a schoolboy s uniform a Young Conservative dance in Rickmansworth to a charity rock concert where his song about chundering vomiting almost makes him an international star and finally to the B B C T V Centre where he pulls his pants down on a live talk show hosted by the thinking man s crumpet herself Joan Bakewell A fire breaks out and Bazza s friends come to the rescue downing cans of Fosters they urinate on the flames en masse br br This is a far cry from Bruce Beresford s later works Breaker Morant and Driving Miss Daisy On release it was savaged by critics for being too vulgar Well yes it is but it is also great non P C fun Bazza is a disgusting creation but his zest for life is unmistakable you cannot help but like the guy His various euphemisms for urinating point Percy at the porcelain and vomiting the Technicolour yawn have passed into the English language without a lot of people knowing where they came from Other guest stars include Dick Bentley as a detective who chases Bazza everywhere Peter Cook Julie Covington later to star in Rock Follies and even future arts presenter Russell Davies br br A sequel the wonderfully named Barry McKenzie Holds His Own came out two years later At its premiere Humphries took the opportunity to blast the critics who had savaged the first film Good for him br br What must have been of greater concern to him though was the release of Crocodile Dundee in 1985 It also featured a lanky hat wearing Aussie struggling to come to terms with a foreign culture And made tonnes more money br br The song on the end credits performed by Snacka Fitzgibbon is magnificent You have a love a lyric that includes the line If you want to send your sister in a frenzy introduce her to Barry McKenzie Time to end this review I have to go the dunny to shake hands with the unemployed
This film and it s sequel Barry Mckenzie holds his own are the two greatest comedies to ever be produced A great story a young Aussie bloke travels to england to claim his inheritance and meets up with his mates who are just as loveable and innocent as he is br br It s chock a block full of great sayings where else could you find someone who needs a drink so bad that he s as dry as a dead dingoes donger great characters top acting and it s got great sheilas and more Fosters consumption then any other three films put together Top notch br br And some of the funniest songs you ll ever hear and it s full of great celebrities Definitely my two favourite films of all time I watch them at least once a fortnight
I love this movie like no other Another time I will try to explain its virtues to the uninitiated but for the moment let me quote a few of pieces the remarkable dialogue which please remember is all tongue in cheek Aussies and Poms will understand everyone else well br br title song lyric he can sink a beer he can pick a queer in his latest double breasted Bondi gear br br another song lyric All pommies are bastards bastards or worse and England is the a e hole of the universe br br during a television interview on an arty program Mr Mackenzie what artists have impressed you most since you ve been in England Barry s response Flamin bull artists br br while chatting up a naive young pom girl Mr Mackenzie I suppose you have hordes of Aboriginal servants back in Australia Barry s response Abos I ve never seen an Abo in me life Mum does most of the solid yacca ie hard work round our place br br This is just a taste of the hilarious farce of this bonser Aussie flick If you can get a copy of it watch and enjoy
A hit at the time but now better categorised as an Australian cult film The humour is broad unsubtle and in the final scene where a BBC studio fire is extinguished by urinating on it crude Contains just about every cliche about the traditional Australian pilgrimage to the old country and every cliche about those rapacious stuck up whinging Tory Brits Would be acceptable to the British because of its strong cast of well known actors and to Australians of that generation who can get the humour Americans forget it The language and jokes are in the Australian dialect of English and as such will be unintelligible
Very smart sometimes shocking I just love it It shoved one more side of David s brilliant talent He impressed me greatly David is the best The movie captivates your attention for every second
With the mixed reviews this got I wasn t expecting too much and was pleasantly surprised It s a very entertaining small crime film with interesting characters excellent portrayals writing that s breezy without being glib and a good pace It looks good too in a funky way Apparently people either like this movie or just hate it and I m one who liked it
This movie really kicked some ass I watched it over and over and it never got boring Angelina Jolie really kicked some ass in the movie you should see the movie you won t be disappointed And another reason you should see the movie is because the guy from The X Files is in it David Duchovny
I d always wanted David Duchovney to go into the movie business and finally he did and he made me proud This movie lived up to what I had hoped for Duchovney played his character very well managing to remain consistent with something new instead of playing the Agent Molder we are used to Therefore I give him extra credit for his role also because I could not see anyone else playing that particular character David was great but nothing compared to the psychotic Timothy Hutton A brilliant performance that you don t get tired of throughout the movie because he never fails to surprise you He has weaknesses and strengths making the story all the more believable I also very much enjoyed the narration it added to the story a good deal and had some very memorable quotes that i still use to all the time This movie also had a wounderfull score I recomend this for anyone who likes drama and doesn t mind blood
Like I said its a hidden surprise It well written well acted and well cast I liked everything in this movie Look its Hollywood all right but the brighter side Angelina Jolie is great in this and I m totally watching every movie with her in that I can get my hands on Well worth a look
David Duchovney creates a role that he was to replicate somewhat in Californication the troubled talent And it is a role he plays well br br This thriller starts off at a good speed and carries you through to the end Timothy Hutton plays a fine villain and Angelina Jolie pouts The story of a disgraced doctor finding his way into a criminal world is well scripted Drug addiction and a desire for the sultry Jolie mix a heady cocktail Unfortunately towards the end the story gets a little weaker and the relationships between villains and the FBI is muddled and rushed as if it was created only to develop the final scene But that aside a movie worth seeing
This film has a lot of raw potential The script is sharp the dialogue is usually excellent though it could stand to lose the cheezy voice overs the direction and cinematography is surprisingly quite good though some of the experimentation just doesn t work The main problem here is David Duchovny Once a geek boy always a geek boy and the sad simple fact is that he s incapable of playing anything but Fox Mulder He postures he tries to be slick he poses he tries to be macho In the end he just tries too hard He overplays his character he overspeaks his lines and he s just outplayed in all ways by Timothy Hutton and Angelina Jolie who are each in a class above him in terms of acting skill Timothy Hutton was as always really good There was a spotty moment or two where he over dramatized his role but you could tell he was having fun with it He looked the part and he became the character both physically and atmospherically Angelina Jolie was also really good She didn t have much of a role in fact I though she could have used a much stronger one her character wasn t nearly developed enough though she did remarkably well with what she had And the chemistry between her and Hutton was apparent gee maybe that s why Uma left him All in all it was rough around the edges but a solid effort by a good cast and great supporting roles If David Duchovny hadn t ripped his role to pieces it would ve been that much better 7 10
I enjoyed this movie Unlike like some of the pumped up steroid trash that is passed off as action movies Playing God is simple and realistic with characters that are believable action that is not over the top and enough twists and turns to keep you interested until the end br br Well directed well acted and a good story
David Duchovny plays the lead role in this film Now a lot of people upon finding that fact out wouldn t even bother watching it Very unfair to say the least David made his name on the x files and is a decent actor Dr Eugene Sands Duchovny is a drug addicted doctor struck off for malpractice By sheer accident he becomes a private doctor for criminal millionaire Raymond Blossom However the FBI take an interest in using Eugene to snare Blossom Angelina Jolie is cast in the supporting role of clare the gangsters moll She puts in a solid performance Timothy Hutton playing Blossom is superb and immersed himself deeply into his character Duchovny himself isn t as bad as many people would think and in the end i would rate his performance his credible His familiar monotonous tone and straight face is present but dosen t detract too much from the film
Normally I don t watch action movies because of the fact that they are usually all pretty similar This movie did have many stereotypical action movie scenes but the characters and the originality of the film s premise made it much easier to watch David Duchovny bended his normal acting approach which was great to see Angelina Jolie of course was beautiful and did great acting Great cast all together A must see for people bored with the same old action movie
Okay truthfully I saw the previews for this movie and thought to myself what are the producers thinking Hutton Jolie and DUCHOVNY How could the monotoned actor possibly compete with Jolie s natural power on the screen But surprisingly the two had the kind of chemistry that showed intense caring without a kiss Even David s humor matched up to Jolie s spark and fire As for Hutton he played the psycho very well contrasting with David s calm delivery of life threatening situations Overall I was very impressed with the writing and character development I gave it 8 stars
I was expecting this to be the same kind of schlock as the previous Modesty Blaise movie which is why I left it unwatched for so long but I was very pleasantly surprised br br Far from being a succession of silly gun battles and car boat chases it was an almost thoughtful analysis of how a pretty girl gets to become as hard as nails with nothing being overstated or over rationalized br br It s likely that the budgetary constraints actually helped with that less time and effort was spent on finding ever stupider ways for stunt men to pretend to die and more was dedicated to making the movie worth watching Hell the biggest gun battle takes place off screen and the scene where it is heard is all the better for that background noise that adds to the suspense who s winning Who s dying br br Alexandra Staden might not be as drop dead gorgeous as Monica Vitti but few are and she certainly has every ounce of class and fire that s needed to make the character work and the shape of her face her hair and her tall slender body could have been lifted straight from the comic strip graphics br br Nikolaj Coaster Waldau was the perfect choice for a Blaise bad guy in that he made the character interesting and enjoyable to watch even likable and I doubt I d consider taking on many brutal psychopathic murderers as drinking buddies I can t think of a single one of Hollywood s former waiters who could have pulled the role off that well br br Fortunately Blaise baddies always die in the end no spoilers there That s a really good thing because all the girls who would have spent their time swooning over such a disgustingly handsome and interesting hunk can now pragmatically settle for us ordinary Joes
This is a good movie although people unfamiliar with the Modesty Blaise comics and books may find it a little slow and lacking in action For the Modesty fan the movie will be very enjoyable particularly because it is very faithful in its presentation of the Modesty Blaise history Peter O Donnell is listed in the credits as Creative Consultant and the film makers must have actually paid attention to him as the plot follows quite closely the details that have been presented in the comic books over the years although the events have been recast to modern days The only thing that the true fan may find disappointing is that there is no Willie Garvin in the story This lack of Willie is again just being faithful to the Modesty Blaise chronology since the movie takes place in the very early days of Modesty s career Alexandra Staden makes a very believable young Modesty who actually looks a lot like Modesty is supposed to look A welcome change from the travesty of the Monica Vitti portrayal of Modesty
For a first film in a proposed series it achieves the right balance It is done with style and class showing Modesty s early days as a refugee and the start of her rise to power in the criminal world I think it is a very honest true portrayal of her character exactly as the writer Peter O Donnell intended Alexandra Staden as Modesty is stunningly beautiful and an excellent choice She acts very convincingly as the tough survivor with an exterior of cool intelligent innocence And full marks to Tarantino for choosing an unknown actress for the role much more believeable to have a new face creating the part I m looking forward to the next film
I was pleased to see that she had black hair I ve been a fan for about 30 years now and have been disgusted at the two earlier attempts to film the stories br br I was pleased that the screenwriters updated the period to include a computer it didn t spoil it at all In fact I watched the film twice in one day a sure sign that it was up to standard This is what I do with books that I like as well br br I thought all the characters were well depicted and represented the early days of Modesty Blaise extremely well as evinced in both book and comic strip I would also have to disagree with a comment made by an earlier reviewer about baddies having to be ugly Has he actually read the books br br I thought this was a very good film and look forward to sequels with anticipation
I have read modesty Blaise for several years now collecting numbers of the strip After the fiasco movie made many years ago based on the first book Modesty Blaise I was surprised the result got this good br br What I got was a movie not based on action or violence The director had focused on history and psychology How was Modesty created based on the own tale and what parts in her life was affected by her non childhood I think this thougths will give a greater understanding to the next I hope film I simply loved the movies old fashioned style br br However everything wasn t that good the gambling wasn t that good almost boring and unreal The acting could have been improved too I m not thinking the bad guy in this movie felt real the only reason he was there was so Modesty could have someone to tell her story for Also they could have expanded the movie showing more about when she builds up The network but I ll guess thats for the next movie br br And please forgive me for my bad English
As a long time fan of Peter O Donnell s greatest creation I watched this film on DVD with no great hopes of enjoyment indeed I expected to be reaching in disgust for the remote control within fifteen minutes But instead I thoroughly enjoyed this production and I especially enjoyed and appreciated how the producers and director succeeded in telling the Modesty Blaise back story They managed to avoid the trap of making a bad film version of the books we are all so familiar with choosing instead to concentrate on a period in Modesty s life only alluded to in the novels br br As for the production values and I am no student of cinematography yes the film was filmed on a tight financial and time budget and maybe that shows but does it spoil the viewer s enjoyment In this case I think not Instead we are introduced to one of the world s greatest literary heroines and given a taste of her capabilities br br In regard to the casting because we in unfamiliar territory the only people who really matter are Modesty and perhaps Professor Lob For me they were totally credible Alexandra Staden described by some as wooden and too thin to be an action heroine brought to the screen Modesty s poise and coolness her technique when martial arts were needed but most importantly personified the integrity which is at the core of the Modesty Blaise canon br br OK so we all know this film was produced to stake Miramax s claim to the Modesty Blaise character it was made quickly and cheaply BUT I for one cannot wait to see the next production in this series by these producers as long as they keep to the core values and characterisations of the original stories
The movie was a long awaited release which where a bit disappointing because of the expectation s I had set up When looking at it again I must say it is actually pretty OK First of all is it very true to the original history of course not completely and is as such only made to keep the right for the movie Modesty s history as a child is shown and is very true to the original The acting is perhaps not the best around and the plot is a bit thin but when you compare it to the 1966 Vitti movie is way better just because it is not trying to be a musical Generally would I only recommend it to fans of Modesty Blaise or to someone who by catch it on the TV
While the main story is supposed to take place in Morocco this movie was shot in foggy Romania in 18 days on a very tight budget However broken their cards may be the actors and the crew play them with remarkable skill and commitment so that in the end I found the result both touching and graceful Nikolaj Coaster Waldau provides a formidable performance as the bad guy The script and direction provide some gems Whether you will like the movie or not however will probably depend on your take on Alexandra Staden in the title role Other reviewers have pointed out Staden s inadequacies as Modesty Blaise They may have a point but I found her interpretation delightful and very fitting Modesty manages to overcome terrible odds through discipline innate talent and courage Staden appears to be doing the same here
Recap It s business as usual at Louche s casino in Tanger The casino is about to close and prepares for a big transaction the next day The owner Louche and some staff leave for the night leaving Modesty in charge Suddenly a troop of armed gangsters storm the casino shooting wildly Unknown to Modesty they have already killed Louche and are now after the money hidden in the vault But no one present and still alive at the casino knows the code to open the vault The vault itself is heavily booby trapped with explosives so the assailants can t blow the door as planned Suddenly Modesty finds herself eye to eye with the gangsters leader Miklos in a game of roulette with their lives in jeopardy br br Comments This is a review written with no connection what so ever with other published media about Modesty Blaise as I have neither seen nor read any of it The first point I like to make is that this is slightly wrongfully classified Foremost I thought this was a thriller with a battle of wits between Modesty and Miklos as the main plot Sure there are some bursts of action but they are not really an integral or important part of the story br br As already mentioned the main plot and the main suspense filled scene is the game between Modesty and Miklos It s an innovative and intriguing way of revealing the background of a character and in doing so much of the story takes place outside the casino at a much earlier time Someone said that it is almost like a pilot for a TV series and the feeling is that it might indeed be used as such But I felt it was a much better way to introduce a character than many other have done I was in no way disappointed in the lack of action instead I enjoyed this game the history much more than a simple action movie br br I think the two main stars Alexandra Staden and Nikolaj Coaster Waldau did very well Staden especially portrays Modesty very well and really carries this confident and talented character br br 7 10
This was the Modesty that we didn t know It was hinted at and summarized in the comic strip for the syndicates to sell to newspapers Lee and Janet Batchler were true Modesty Blaise fans who were given The Dream Job tell a prequel story of Modesty that the fans never saw before In their audio commentary they admitted that that they made changes in her origin to make the story run smoother The purists should also note that we really don t know if everything she told Miklos was true because she was stalling for time I didn t rent or borrow the DVD like other reviewers did I bought it And I don t want a refund I watched it three times and I didn t sleep through it Great dialog and well drawn characters that I cared about even bad guy Miklos just like in the novels and comic strips I too can t wait for the next Modesty and Willie film especially if this prequel is a sign of what s to come
Shot on an impossible schedule and no budget to speak of the movie turned out a lot better than you would expect certainly much more true to the Peter O Donnell books and comic strip than the previous two films You can read the strip currently in the reprints from Titan Books or in Comics Revue monthly It is one of the greatest adventure comic strips of all time The movie isn t great but unlike most low budget films it makes the most of what its got and it holds your interest On the DVD extras the interview with Quentin Tarentino who is obviously stoned is a gas Some people have faulted Tarentino for associating his name with the film but without him it would never have been made He is a Modesty Blaise fan and picked a good writer and director All things considered worth 8 stars
I enjoyed this film It was a joy to see a version so close to the vision of Peter O Donnell br br A number of people have disliked the film but it has to be seen in context of the origin story that it is The film uses flashback to show the young Modesty and the events that shaped her into the woman that she became Before the Network Before Willie Garvin br br The pace is a trifle slow and for my taste not enough tension is developed in the present day scenes However this is acceptable just to get such a faithful version br br If you like Modesty Blaise you will enjoy it even with its faults if you just want an action flick with car chases forget it br br It has the feeling of being the first of a franchise but as I have never seen it promoted anywhere I suspect there will be no more to follow Sadly
The best Modesty Blaise movie I have seen so far It s like a good pilot for a TV series I even think it s a little bit cult like with a lite touch of Quentin Tarantino s magic or something They have caught a great deal of Modesty s character but I admit missing Willy Garwin a bit Even if i have read many comics and book by Peter O donnell I m not disappointed of this film quite the opposite Positive surprised of this story about Modesty and her childhood I did not put my expectations so high because of the bad movie from 1966 So I may have overrate this movie just a little But if you like the comics and other storys about Modesty Blaise you should definitely see this one can t wait for a follow up
I ve seen this movie and I must say I m very impressed There are not much movies I like but I do like this one You should see this movie by yourself and comment it because this is one of my most favorite movie I fancy to see this again Action fused with a fantastic story Very impressing I like Modesty s character Actually she s very mystic and mysterious I DO like that The bad boy is pretty too Well actually this whole movie is rare in movieworld I considered about the vote of this movie I thought this is should be a very popular movie I guess wrong It was ME who was very impressed about this movie and I hope I m not the only one who takes only the cost to watch this one See and vote
Having heard of Modesty Blaise before but never having read a novel or a comic strip my wife and I liked the film a lot It delivered in a captivating way a good introduction to the character and her background br br Although it has some action flick elements it is much more an intimate play excellently written Sadly this is also where a major drawback of the movie is revealed An intimate play lives on the capabilities of its actors and unfortunately only half of the cast delivered While Alexandra Staden did an excellent job as Modesty Blaise her counterpart Nikolaj Coaster Waldau as the villain Miklos did not Smiling his way through the plot as if it is an extend toothpaste commercial he fails to build up an atmosphere of anxiety that would have made the movie a masterpiece The supporting cast is somehow similar from some stereotyped gangsters and sluts to decent performances from Fred Pearson as Professor Lob and Eugenia Yuan as Irina
There s a great deal of material from the Modesty Blaise comics and novels that would be great in a movie Unfortunately several attempts have been made and they ve fallen short of the great potential in the character So no this isn t the Modesty you know from the comic strip currently reprinted in nice editions from Titan Books This is Modesty some 5 or 6 years prior to the first strip and from what you can piece together from her back story it s accurate br br Miramax had the movie rights to the character with Quentin Tarantino acting as advocate and technical adviser Early drafts of the Miramax project attempted to adapt one of the best novels but always managed to leave out some crucial element Tarantino wasn t happy with any of them and offered to remove his name from the project so they could proceed To the studio s credit they wanted to keep him in the process since they knew he got the character and her world With the movie rights close to expiration they decided to try a very different approach The result was My Name is Modesty a small direct to video movie that introduces the character br br The movie does not introduce Willie Garvin or Sir Gerald These characters are important to Blaise s adventures throughout most of the published stories What this movie accomplishes is showing the strength of the character by herself She never loses her composure and you never doubt that she s in charge even unarmed in a room full of gangsters with guns Most of the movie takes place within a casino which undoubtedly saved money on the production It doesn t matter The film does not come across as cheap Instead it gives a fairly comprehensive and believable back story for the character and demonstrates just how far she thinks ahead Should Miramax adapt any of the comic stories or novels now they ve laid out the character s background nicely and won t have to spend much time on her origin I realize the words Direct to Video don t inspire confidence but this film is well worth a look
First off I m a dedicated fan of Modesty s and have been reading the comics since I was a child and I have found the earlier movies about our heroine unsatisfying but where they fail this one ROCKS br br Well then here we go Ms Blaise is working for a casino a gang of robbers comes along and she starts gambling for her friends lives If the robber wins one round she ll have to tell him about herself If she wins two times in a row one of the staff members goes free Sounds stupid yeah well I m not that good at explaining either br br She tells him about growing up in a war zone without parents or friends about her helping an old man in the refugee camp and how they escape living by nature s own rules They hunt for food and he teaches her to read and fight As they approach civilization they get caught up in a war and as they are taken for rebellions they are being shot at and the old man dies which leaves her to meet the city by herself br br Then she meets the man who s casino she s now working for and there the story ends br br What is to follow is that there s an awesome fight and the line s are totally cool Alexandra Staden is a TERRIFIC Modesty Blaise Just as modest and strong graceful and intellectual as the comic one br br Feels awkward though too hear Modesty speak with a slightly broken accent but that s not relevant since the comic book blaise can t speak out loud but certainly must have a somewhat existing accent Not to mention that it s weird everybody s speaking English in the Balkan br br The acting is really good even the child who personifies the young Blaise must have a applaud br br My favorite part must be where she rips up her dress to kick the stupid robber s ass Totally awesome D I can t wait until the real adventure begins in the next movie s br br Watch it you won t be disappointed
Finally was there released a good Modesty Blaise movie which not only tells a story but actually tells the real story I admit that it is a bad movie if you expect an action thriller but if you stop in your track and remove all your expectations Then you will notice that it is a story that comes very close to the original made by Peter O Donnell You have a cover story just to tell about how Modesty became the magnificent person which she is It is not a movie to attract new fans but a movie to tell the real tale Some things could have been better but when you cannot forget the awful movie from 66 then is this a magnificent movie So are you a fan then sit down relax and just enjoy that the real story is there with a cover story just to make Modesty tell her story
Rented and watched this short 90 minutes work It s by far the best treatment Modesty has received on film and her creator Peter O Donnell agrees participating as a Creative Consultant The character and we who love her are handled with respect Spiegel s direction is the best he s done to date and the casting was very well done Alexandra Staden is almost physically perfect as a match to the original Jim Holdaway illustrations of Modesty A terrific find by whoever cast her Raymond Cruz as a young Rafael Garcia was also excellent I hope that Tarantino co will go on to make more in the series I m especially interested to see whom they d choose to be the incomparable Willie Garvin
Although I bought the DVD when it first came out and have watched it several times I never wrote a review br br I loved it when I first saw it and I love it still br br Sadly it seems it never made enough money to motivate anyone to do a follow up I have to assume QT still controls the rights but after Kill Bill if he does a film that is as true to the comics and books as My Name is Modesty with another tough female lead anyone not familiar with the character will see this as a let down br br Peter O Donnell wrote his stories to focus more on psychological suspense rather than action thrillers br br The tug of wills between Modesty and Miklos is very true to the source material and is tense suspenseful and fascinating to anyone who doesn t have to have gore and explosions Alexandra did a great job in playing how O Donnell s character would have taken control of the situation br br I find this particularly ahead of the curve following the sorely needed reboots of Batman and James Bond After 2 dismal earlier efforts although not nearly as well known to the public this is really a reboot of the Modesty character and it is really sad that probably no more films about her will be made
If you are already a fan of Peter O Donnell s wonderful Modesty Blaise books from the sixties you will really enjoy this movie If you have ever seen the 1966 Modesty Blaise film forget it That was camp This is the real Modesty Blaise The story and character are both true to the Modesty that fans of the books know and love It s a long way from Joe Losey s 1966 travesty and it takes our Modesty quite seriously Alexandra Staden is quite good and believable in the part and yes we do get to see her kick butt chuckle br br This is likely meant to be the first movie of a series and as such it serves to introduce Modesty her childhood and her days with Lob br br Since Peter O Donnell was the creative consultant on the movie everything really rings true Even the story O Donnell told of how he conceived the character is just as he told it Having read all the books I enjoyed the movie even more for that br br Now that Miramax has kept their option on the property by having Quentin Tarrentino make this film I do hope to see more of the Modesty stories asap Especially as the wonderful character of Willie Garvin makes Modesty s character really come alive To that end I really hope the film does well in Europe I have no idea if Miramax intends to ever distribute the DVD in the USA I suspect it might not do that well in the USA in general distribution I wonder how Miramax decides where and how to distribute it s films br br In the story Modesty is in her early 20 s working at Louche s casino in Tangier The flashback sequences are artfully done and take Modesty from about 9 years old through her teens up to her current age in the movie about 21 22 I d guess I really don t think there s a perfect actress for Modesty For many of us Modesty fans she s much too powerful a presence in our imaginations already Alexandra Staden is credible She is very slim graceful and poised She has lots of closeups She has a great face one that sticks in your mind well after the movie is over According to O Donnell s illustrator Romero Modesty has rather a fuller figure than Staden but I m willing to overlook that If Staden continues in the role I think she will mature into it just as Modesty grows more powerful and skilled as she gets older Staden already conveys Modesty s humor and absolute assurance very well Go ahead and rent this movie it s not like anything else you ve seen and even though it was directed by Scott Spiegel it is full of Tarrentino touches great camera moves lighting and well done action sequences
Unfortunately many consumers who write reviews for IMDb equate low budget with not good Whatever else this movie might need more budget really isn t part of it Big sets and lots of special effects would have turned it into another Lara Croft movie What we have here is a step or two better than that br br The nearly unknown Alexandra Staden is captivating as the enigmatic Modesty and this is crucial for this movie to work Her wise little smiles and knowing looks are formidable and you find yourself wishing that the camera won t leaver her face It makes it workable that the bad guy Nikolai played by also little known in the U S at least Nikolaj Coaster Waldau might take an unusually cerebral interest in her something Modesty can exploit She is able to divert his raping her with just a shove and spitting out stop wasting my time then storming off between his heavily armed yet suddenly diffident henchmen Making a scene like that plausible doesn t happen by accident br br Probably the biggest problem I have with the rail thin Staden playing Modesty is it just isn t very believable for her to go hand to hand with an athletic and muscled looking guy like Coaster Waldau and beat him She just ain t a Peta Wilson or a pumped up Hilary Swank type actress who can throw a convincing punch Coaster Waldau letting himself be overpowered by Staden looks like he s just roughhousing with his little sister br br Since this is not really an action film this isn t a big flaw I just hope they do better on that if and when they make sequels
magellan33 said You can only do so much when the two stars of the show can only be seen by one fellow cast member br br I assume then that you never heard of Topper br br Which in addition to the two stars who could only be seen by one member of the cast had a dog ditto br br This was the kind of program that had Not Gonna Make It written allover it from the first episode it was like an arcade video game where you actually have to read the instructions to play no one well very few of us apparently wants to watch a comedy program that has a basic premise that actually requires thought to grasp
I used to watch this show when I was a little girl Although I don t remember much about it I must say that it was a pretty good show Also I don t think I ve seen every episode However if you ask me it was still a good show I vaguely remember the theme song Everyone was ideally cast the costume design was great The performances were top grade too I just hope some network brings this series back one day so that I ll be able to see every episode Before I wrap this up I d like to say that I ll always remember this show in my memory forever even though I don t think I ve seen every episode Now in conclusion when and if this show is ever brought back on the air I hope that you catch it one day before it goes off the air for good
This movie is definately one of my favorite movies in it s kind The interaction between respectable and morally strong characters is an ode to chivalry and the honor code amongst thieves and policemen It treats themes like duty guilt word manipulation and trust like few films have done and unfortunately none that I can recall since the death of the policial in the late seventies The sequence is delicious down to the essential living nothing out and thus leading the spectator into a masterful plot right and wrong without accessory eye catching and spectacular scenes that are often needed in lesser specimens of the genre in order to keep the audience awake No such scenes are present or needed The argument is sand honest to the spectator An important asset in a genre that too often achieve suspense through the deception of the audience No this is not miss Marble A note of congratulations for the music is in order A film to watch and savor every minute not just to see
Short synopsis br br This film opens with soldiers being released from the company of men One of them pursues another with a weird scheme the other repeatedly refuses Later they both get trapped in an office building in which they want to crack a safe during the Christmas holidays Hostility turns into playful banter and then into a desperate fight for survival during the bantering they lose all drinkable liquids so it is really serious With exposed well built and well oiled torsos they ram a hole into a wall and finally manage to escape only to find out that they have been betrayed and set up by women One gets caught the other remains free and is not given away by his companion A last encounter a last light for a cigarette adieu l ami farewell friend br br I found it hard not to see closet homosexuals in the two main characters played by classical he man superstars Alain Delon and Charles Bronson They are obviously attracted to each other their treatment of women is abominable and marked by contempt throughout The whole story seems to have a strong symbolic undertow a little like Deliverance It is also very stylish The safe the two men want to crack is in a for the time ultra modern glass and aluminum tower It is the seat of a publicity firm so there are many fancy posters and wall coverings around The wardrobe is also very good The ultra stylish Citroen DS maybe the most modern and elegant car of all times features large in this movie perhaps a subtle kind of product placement br br I can recommend this movie for the actor s performances alone Delon and Bronson are really sharing the top billing in a manner that struck me as very fair and sporting Both do a considerable amount of acrobatics I have never seen Bronson better than here he really acts and speaks French throughout with a heavy accent buy very passably indeed And it is certainly the man himself we hear So the French language version is highly recommended The police inspector who pursues the two is played by on of my favorite Franch character actors Bernard Fresson who was Gene Hackman s partner in French Connection II He is the best brainy police inspector I know Also very good is former child actress Brigitte Fossey as the young ing√©nue who as it turns out is not so Innocent as it first seems br br Anyone who expects the old in an out of classical heist movies might be disappointed with this film For those with a little patience this will be a rewarding experience full of novel and original ideas and directorial quirks although it my be a little too brutal and sadistic for its own sake
Utterly tactical strange watch for the kinky moment of a drop dead gorgeous blonde acting as pull string doll for some rich folks pointless but undoubtedly compelling late night feature This unhinged French production is a stew of perplexedly unfocused ideas and random plot illustrations centred on its very charismatic stars if somewhat anti heroes Alain Delon and Charles Bronson Really they don t get to do all that much especially during the confined lengthy mid section where they hide themselves in a building during the Christmas break to crack a safe with 10 000 possible combinations Oh fun But this is when the odd if intriguing relationship is formed between Delon and Bronson s characters After a manipulative battle of wills and childishly sly games against each other the two come to an understanding that sees them honour each other s involvement and have a mutual respect This would go on to play a further part in the twisty second half of the story with that undetectable curve ball Still their encounters early on suggest there s more but what we get is vague and this is magnified by that What just happen there ending that might just make you jump YEEEEAAAAAHHHHHHHHH Glad to get that out of the system br br The pacing is terribly slow but placidly measured for it and this seems purposely done to exhaust with its edgy nervous underlining tension Watch as the same process is repeated over and over again and you know something is not quite right and the scheming eventually comes into play Now everything that does happen feels too spontaneous but the climax payoff is haunting The taut complex script is probably a little too crafty for its own good but there are some neat novelties Coins glass and liquids try not spilling and visual symbolisms Jean Herman s direction is efficiently sophisticated and low key but get a tad artificial and infuse an unwelcoming icy atmosphere The sound FX features more as a potent note than that of Francois DeRoubaix s funky score that s mainly kept under wrapped after its sizzling opening Top drawers Delon who s quite steely and Bronson a jovial turn are solid and work off each tremendously Bernard Fresson chalks up the attitude as the Inspector who knows there s more going on than what is being led on An attractive female cast features able support by Brigitte Fossey and Olga Georges Picot br br A cryptically directionless but polished crime drama maintained by its two leads and some bizarre inclusions
This movie is definately one of my favourite movies in it s kind The interaction between respectable and morally uncorruptable characters is an ode to chivalry and the honour code amongst thieves and policemen It treats themes like duty guilt word manipulation and trust like few films have done and unfortunately none that I can recall since the death of the policial in the late seventies The sequence is delicious down to the essential living nothing out and thus leading the spectator into a masterful plot right and wrong without accessory eye catching and spectacular scenes that are often needed in lesser specimens of the genre in order to keep the audience awake No such scenes are present or needed The argument is flowless and honest to the spectator wich is an important asset in a genre in wich the the suspense is often achieved through the betrail of the audience No this is not miss Marble A note of congratulations for the music is in order A film to watch and savour every minute not just to see
Farewell Friend aka Adieu L Ami Honour Among Thieves isn t perfect but it is a neat and entertaining thriller that sees mismatched demobbed French Algerian War veterans Alain Delon and Charles Bronson trapped in the same basement vault one to return stolen bonds the other to clean out the two million in wages sitting there over the Christmas weekend Naturally things aren t quite that simple even after they open the vault leading to some neat twists and turns On the debit side there s a very bizarre striptease scene in a car park Bronson has a very irritating Fonzie like catchphrase he uses at the most inopportune moments Brigitte Fossey sporting perhaps the most hideously misconceived hairstyle of the 60s it makes her look like a bald woman whose wig is blown back off the top of her head by a high wind is something of a liability her I ll cook spaghetti I ll learn to make love well I ll read Shakespeare speech is hysterical in all the wrong ways and it s a shame about the horrible last line shot but otherwise this is a surprisingly entertaining and unpretentious number that s worth checking out if you can find a decent print br br Cinema Club s UK DVD only offers the English soundtrack but since Delon voices himself and the rest of the cast are fairly well dubbed that s no great problem especially since the widescreen transfer is pretty good quality
A clever script from the late SEBASTIAN JAPRISOT and smart performances from the two male leads ALAIN DELON and CHARLES BRONSON or should it be the other way around result in an engaging and entertaining thriller br br Add to the above the competent direction from veteran JEAN HERMAN and a sparse but effective score by FRANCOIS DE ROUBAIX it becomes easy why this film has an odd timeless quality br br This is a buddy buddy or bonding story with two loners both disillusioned and world weary returning presumably from Algiers Like the other colonial powers of this time post WW II leading into the 60s France had struggled to keep up appearances overseas Losing Algiers was a bitter blow br br ADIEU L AMI the original title chronicles the actions of our two anti heroes as they struggle to make a go of it after their discharge br br One thing happens after another and the viewer really has to pay attention because JAPRISOT is lean and economical with his script if it is there then there must be a reason br br Suffice to say these two men battle it out physically and psychologically one long weekend Their motivation is quite different their goals are different their survival depends entirely on each other That ALAIN DELON and CHARLES BRONSON are outwardly so different the former arguably a pretty boy and the latter an ugly thug adds to the chemistry br br That quest makes for a great story which in turn makes for a great film br br Lest I forget there are women in this film and true to the Japrisot method they too are memorable though not nearly as fleshed out to say much more would be to spoil one s delight in discovering their true nature br br FAREWELL FRIEND HAS BEEN RELEASED IN THE UK AN ANAMORPHIC IMAGE 16 9 ENHANCED IN English ONLY not even subtitles for the hard of hearing A RUNNING TIME OF 110 MINUTES MONO SOUNDTRACK but the DE ROUBAIX music has lots of punch br br Highly recommended
Noni Hazlehurst s tour de force performance which won her an AFI award is at least on par with her effort in FRAN three years later Colin Friels is also good and for those who are interested Alice Garner appears as Noni s child and Michael Caton best known for THE CASTLE is a bearded painter Also interestingly Hazlehurst is currently the host of lifestyle program BETTER HOMES AND GARDENS and Caton is the host of property type programs including HOT PROPERTY HOT AUCTION etc This film reaffirms the popularly held belief that Noni was arguably Australia s top female actor during the early to mid 1980s Rating 79 100
Nora is a single mother of two who still wants to live the life of a young artist in the 1970s as do her friends a group of writers singers and actors The free love philosophy isn t quite out of the system and Nora didn t count on falling in love particularly with a junkie Hazlehurst won her first of two AFI Awards in the space of four years for her amazing portrayal of Nora who makes sure she does the right thing by her children but falls in love with junkie Javo Friels at the same time Garner who would later costar in films such as LOVE AND OTHER CATASTROPHES and STRANGE PLANET is well cast as Nora s pre pubescent daughter and Caton perhaps in readiness for his role as host of the lifestyle program HOT PROPERTY in 2000 appears as a bearded painter Early effort by director Cameron is a winner he went on to make the award winning miniseries MY BROTHER JACK among his later projects But it s the stunning delivery by Hazlehurst which brings to life the intelligent searching script based on Helen Garner s award winning novel
Noni Hazlehurst Colin Friels Alice Garner Chrissie Amphlett and Michael Caton what more could you ask for Monkey Grip based on the prize winning novel of the same name explores Nora Hazlehurst a single mother falling for a heroin addict Jobe Friels A simple story is made truly extraordinary through the all round magnificent acting in particular Noni Hazlehurst and nice use of the small budget The only flaw is if you can pick it up is that the story is set in Melbourne although for budget reasons the film was mainly shot in Sydney so as a result in a few scenes you see trams Melbourne scenes and then a Carlton post office Sydney scenes Other than that Monkey Grip is a must see excuse the clique but it is at least for an award winning performance from former Play School and Better Homes Gardens presenter Noni Hazlehurst br br 10 10
I definitely recommend reading the book prior to watching the film This book won National Book Council Award in 1978 and is a very gripping read pun not intended It s not too difficult to read for those out there that don t read often so don t be afraid The book seems to capture the passion of the relationships more so than the movie and the movie will make more sense after reading the book Having grown up in Melbourne I could really relate to this book and movie Very few Australian female writers were around the in the 70 s therefore very little is documented about the way of life for a women in an urban city in Australia during this era or class It s a precious piece of Melbourne history It s a shame that it is documented as some sort of 80 s soft porn movie It s far from that and as the other reviewer has mentioned please do not read the DVD jacket it does not represent what the movie is about at all Those that rent the movie based on this description will only be disappointed Just remember this movie was made in 1982 so don t expect the Hollywood over dramatization that they seem to incorporate these days This is what I like about it It s also great seeing Noni Hazlehurst in this role she is just fantastic as Nora and it s great watching her really acting for if you re close to my age you will best remember her for her stints on Playschool and Better Homes and Gardens Who knew she hid this talent This movie will give you an entirely new impression of her A classic Australian Story
If Jean Renoir s first film Whirlpool of Fate first takes us into the world of the countryside the rivers the lives of the peasantry that he will continue to explore it seems only fitting that his second film deals for the most part with the wealthy and the privileged the upper classes and those who are trying to claw their way upwards Put the characters from the first two films together and you have the seeds of his great Grand Illusion and Rules of the Game This is beautifully filmed with the restless camera making full use of the amazingly huge apartments and backstage areas that dominate the film s interiors and the acting though frequently overwrought offers some great moments as well particularly from Werner Krauss Muffat But the glamorous and sultry Ms Hessling who at first appears as if she might give Louise Brooks a run for her money in vampishness never goes beyond a one note selfish harlot portrayal Perhaps this is in part a problem with the script which does seem to mostly go for high points and outraged emotions not having read the novel I m not really clear on whether the choices were well made or not br br Still the differences between Nana s suitors are well drawn and I particularly liked the relationship between Muffat and Jean Angelo s Vandeuvres the tragic understandings that each seems to have of his ultimate fate and their sympathy with each other particularly in the scene at the bottom of the enormous staircase where Vandeuvres warns Muffat and we wonder if violence will erupt this and other gleanings of the ridiculousness of the idle rich help give the film the depth it has br br Far from his greatest achievement and for me probably just shy overall of Whirlpool of Fate this is still well worth seeing for Renoir fans or those interested in silent cinema generally
This is the first Jean Renoir Silent film I have watched and perhaps rightly so since it is generally regarded to be his best besides being also his first major work Overall it is indeed a very assured and technically accomplished film which belies the fact that it was only Renoir s sophomore effort For fans of the director it is full of interesting hints at future Renoir movies especially THE DIARY OF A CHAMBERMAID 1946 and THE GOLDEN COACH 1952 in its depiction of a lower class femme fatale madly desired by various aristocrats who disgrace themselves for her but also THE RULES OF THE GAME 1939 showing as it does in one sequence how the rowdy servants behave when their masters backs are turned away from them and FRENCH CANCAN 1955 Nana is seen having a go at the scandalous dance at one point Personally I would say that the film makes for a respectable companion piece to G W Pabst s PANDORA S BOX 1928 Josef von Sternberg s THE BLUE ANGEL 1930 and Max Ophuls LOLA MONTES 1955 in its vivid recreation of the sordid life of a courtesan br br Having said all that the film was a resounding critical and commercial failure at the time of its release a mad undertaking as Renoir himself later referred to it in his memoirs which not only personally cost him a fortune he eventually eased the resulting financial burden by selling off some of his late father s paintings but almost made him give up the cinema for good Stylistically NANA is quite different from Renoir s sound work and owes a particular debt to Erich von Stroheim s FOOLISH WIVES 1922 a film Renoir greatly admired and on a personal note one which I really ought to revisit presto having owned the Kino DVD of it and the other von Stroheims for 4 years now Anyway NANA is certainly not without its flaws a deliberate pace makes itself felt during the overly generous 130 minute running time with some sequences the horse race around the mid point in particular going on too long br br The overly mannered acting style on display is also hard to take at times particularly that of Catherine Hessling s Nana and Raymond Guerin Catelain s Georges Hugon one of her various suitors although technically they are being their characters i e a bad actress who takes to the courtesan lifestyle when she is booed off the stage and an immature weakling respectively However like Anna Magnani in THE GOLDEN COACH Hessling Renoir s wife at the time by the way is just not attractive enough to be very convincing as the epitome of elegance as another admirer describes her at one stage who is able to enslave every man she meets Other notables in the cast are Dr Caligari himself Werner Krauss as Nana s most fervent devotee Count Muffat Jean Angelo as an initially skeptical but eventually tragic suitor of Nana s and future distinguished film director Claude Autant Lara billed as Claude Moore and also serving as art director here as Muffat s close friend but who is secretly enamored with the latter s neglected wife br br The print I watched via Lionsgate s Jean Renoir 3 Disc Collector s Edition is for the most part a lovingly restored and beautifully tinted one which had been previously available only on French DVD Being based on a classic of French literature by Emile Zola no less it cannot help but having been brought to the screen several times and the two most notable film versions are Dorothy Arzner s in 1934 with Anna Sten and Lionel Atwill and which I own on VHS and Christian Jaque s in 1955 with Martine Carol and Charles Boyer which I am not familiar with
OK this movie starts out like a cheesy Lifetime movie and doesn t get better till almost well through the movie The script is full of cheese and fluff and cast is not well directed for the most part For the first half of the movie the little girl grated on my nerves I do not think this is one of her best acting jobs The only reason I bought the movie is because it was on sale and had Ellen Burstyn in it She s terrific but this is also not one of her best acting gigs The story is based on true events and that helps the movie Actually I didn t even like the movie at first and was getting disgusted when I saw stills of the balloon traveling I mean let it get where it s suppose to go and be done with it But all is forgiven by the time it does reach it s destination and the story comes to a close If this doesn t bring a tear to your eye nothing will It s cheesy and predictable but also makes you feel good about the world again
It is a great movie i sow that some people think that this might not be based on a true story No matter this the movie is great and all u can think is not why a balloon with a mermaid on it ends up flying in the mermaid town and so on instead thinking that a little girl s wish came true and this means that all our peaceful dreams will come true if we trust in us and do all in this world to make them true The little girl Desi in the movie and her mom were the best actors i ve been seen in a long time Good for they for all actors all for the director If someone can tell them this please tell them A 25 year guy from Romania says thank you for making this movie
i just saw this movie on TV br br i ve lost my dad when i was young and this movie surely did touch me br br i can feel the lost that the little girl Desi felt br br the feeling of wanting to see her father again br br wanting to talk to him br br or at least given the chance to say goodbye br br and i m so touched with the letter that was wrote back to her br br saying that her father read her letter and sent it back to someone to reply her and buy her a present because there isn t a shop in heaven br br it just lets me feel that miracles do exist
I didn t know the real events when I sat down to watch this just the fact that this was based upon a true story After the death of the kid s father Rhonda tries to help her daughter Desiree I did not know anyone actually named their offspring that cope with the loss This is really made for children as is often the case with family flicks with that said go ahead and get everyone together for a viewing though I d keep teenagers out of it unless you re sure they re gonna buy the concept but it doesn t downplay the sting that the death of a parent is and it doesn t really talk down to anyone The plot is sufficiently interesting and moves along well enough Acting varies with the excellent Burstyn outshining most of her fellow cast Mathis following that pretty well and Ferland and her peers with a few exceptions being the least convincing of the bunch and frankly they re irritating then again I m not really in the intended audience for this thing The editing and cinematography are standard and certainly not less than that While humor is limited to a handful of amusing lines or so the tone is not an unpleasant one There is an intense scene or two in this I recommend this to fans of these types of movies 7 10
The little girl Desi is so adorable I cant think of a more beautiful story then this one here It will make you cry laugh and believe Knowing that this was based on a true story just made me gasp and it also made me realize that there are nice people out there Great cast and an overall great movie
A warm touching movie that has a fantasy like quality br br Ellen Burstyn is as always superb br br Samantha Mathis has given many great performances but there is just something about this one will haunt your memory br br Most of all you ve got to see this amazing 5 yr old Jodelle Ferland I was so captivated by her presence I had to buy the movie so I could watch her again and again She is a miracle of God s creation br br Judging by the high IMDB rating I m not the only one who was mesmerized by this young actress
And look how a true story with a little help of it s friends a welldone and touching script a good directing and a surprising great acting from a bunch of no name actors especially from the 4 yr old Jodelle Ferland becomes a must seen movie 9 10
What an inspiring movie I laughed cried and felt love For a true story it does give you hope and that miracles do happen It has a great cast Ellen Burstyn Samantha Mathis Jodelle Ferland she s 4 or 5yrs old what a actress Its on Showtime A Must See Movie
This is just a short comment but I stumbled onto this movie by chance and I loved it The acting is great the story is simple and touching and the lines especially from the 4 yr old Desi are so cute and sad Seek it out
My family and I have viewed this movie often over the years It is clean wholesome heartbreaking and heartwarming Showing us the compassion between two families of two countries thousands of miles apart and by the most uncanny of coincidences it s almost as if the hand of God had to be intervening br br 5 yo Jodelle Micah Ferland who plays Desi the heart stricken little girl does a magnificent job of acting her part and for me she was the Priam choice for the lead role br br All in all a 10 out of 10 There are no downsides to this sweet human story Children of all ages will tearfully then joyfully watch this and it will bring the viewing family together with smiles and good feelings
What a lovely heart warming television movie The story tells of a little five year old girl who has lost her daddy and finds it impossible to cope Her mother is also very distressed only a miracle can alleviate their unhappiness Which all viewers hope will materialise Samantha Mathis is brilliant as the little girl s mum as she was as the nanny in Jack and Sarah worth watching if you like both Samantha Mathis and happy year tear jerking movies Ellen Burstyn is as always a delightful grandmother in this tender and magnificently acted movie Jodelle Ferland the little five year old is charming and a most convincing young actress The film is based on a true story which makes it so touching Mermaid is a tribute to the milk of human kindness which is clearly illustrated and clearly is still all around us in this difficult world we live in Mermaid gives us all hope by realising that there a lot of lovely people in the world with lot s of love to give James Robson Glasgow Scotland U K
What are the odds of a Mermaid helium balloon traveling from Yuba City Ca on Nov 8th 1993 and landing 4 Days later on Nov 12 in MERMAID Prince Edward Island Canada Approx 4000 miles This is a great movie It is based on a true story This movie helps not only children cope with losses but older people as well Hope everyone will enjoy it Rhonda

OK so I don t watch too many horror movies and the reason is films like Dark Remains I caught this on a surprisingly feature filled DVD and it scared me silly In fact the only extra I think the DVD was missing was a pair of new pants br br However the next day I was telling someone about it when I realised I d only really seen about 10 of it The rest of the time I d been watching the pizza on my coffee table nervous that my girlfriend would catch me if I actually covered my eyes The few times I DID brave watching the screen I jumped so hard that I decided not to look up again br br The film making is solid and the characters situation was really compelling The simplicity of the film is what really captured my jump button it s merely a woodland a cabin and a disused jail and a LOT of darkness Most surprising to me was the fact that while this was clearly not a multi million dollar production the make up effects really looked like it was Also it s obvious this is a film made by someone with a great love of film making The sound design and the music really made use of my surround system like many Hollywood movies have never done I noticed on line that this film won the LA Shriekfest a really major achievement and I guess that the festival had seen the filmmakers clear talent and probably a great deal more of this movie than I managed to br br Turn up the sound turn off the lights and if you want to keep your girlfriend order a pizza
I read nothing but good things about this movie and finally had a chance to watch it late last night and it was everything I expected it to be and more This is the way a proper horror movie should be I think the reason it was so scary was because it was so realistic The spooky sounding score was perfect for setting a dark mood I liked the dramatic opening scene and enjoyed how the rest of the movie played out It was very easy to follow and understand unlike some movies which are way too complicated The special effects were very good I would love to see more horror movies like this one This is easily one of my favorite s A realistic thunder and lightning storm would have set a nice atmosphere for this movie Other then that it had all the elements a good horror movie needs I highly recommend this movie to anyone who can appreciate a good scary movie that pulls no punches I will be adding it to my collection The DVD has some interesting special features
Although I was in this movie playing the part of Sheriff Hodges it still managed to make me jump in several places and believe me I m NOT that easy You might say that I m biased about the film and OK I am but I didn t see the finished product until 12 27 2006 and was extremely pleased I m not a Horror film fan as such but love the old B movies and black and white Sci Fi films This movie will make you think you know when something is going to happen then it doesn t then it does It will keep you completely off balance I would suggest watching the movie first then the director s notes and special features It is so well written directed and filmed and I can tell you personally that it was a real joy to work with this cast and crew I sincerely hope to be part of Brian and Laurence s future projects
This movie scared the crap out of me I have to admit that I spent most of the film watching through my fingers but what I saw was really scary I screamed out loud two or three times during the show br br Film making wise my favorite aspects were the sound and photography The sound was particularly great and the setting was really creepy beautiful I read somewhere that it s some weird husband and wife team that made it For some reason that makes this even stranger for me br br If you enjoy the jumps and jitters of scary movies than this one is for you Very suspenseful and a great movie to rent with a bunch of friends who love to watch movies curled up on a sofa screaming like little girls
I just watched this movie and have to say I was very impressed It s very creepy and has numerous moments that will make you jump out of seat I had to smoke several emergency cigarettes along the way to calm my nerves If I had to criticise I d say that perhaps if anything there were too many jump moments It got to the point where every single new scene climaxed with a jump and this gradually wore away the startling effect because you kind of new what was coming br br Although it contains virtually every clich√© in the ghost genre they were all done so well that it maintained the creepy fear factor It had elements of The Shining The 6th Sense and The Changeling in particular the soundtrack reminded me of The Changeling br br I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good old fashioned scare
Well this film is a difficult one really To be straight with you this film doesn t contain much of a riveting story nore does it make u want to know how it ll end but I ll tell you something now never have I been as tense and jumped up before in my life This film sure does deliver the jumps and thrills To be fair I did watch it at almost midnight so I was kinda sleepy anyway so maybe that explains why I was jumpy or maybe it s because this film does deliver in that aspect It s basically about a couple who lose their child in a tragic event They decide to move away and rent a cabin looking thing in the mountains all looks peaceful and calm until they have their first visitors i think it s it s the sister of the main character and she brings along her husband during the night the husband hears noises checks it out and thats when things start to go really really wrong they don t stay for another day and tell the couple they should leave asap as something isn t right to cut a long story short eventually they find out what has happened in that house in the past few years and decide it needs to be taken care of br br It s not a Hollywood blockbuster nore does it have a huge budget but please don t let that put you off It s creepy tense and very very jumpy Just give it a try
Dark Remains is a home run plain and simple The film is full of creepy visuals and scares that will make the most seasoned horror veteran jump straight out of there seat The staircase scene in particular these guys are good Although they weren t working on a huge budget everything looks good and the actors come through Dark Remains does have one of those interpretive endings which may be a negative for some but I guess it makes you think Cheri Christian and Greg Thompson are spot on as the grieving couple trying to rebuild there lives however some side characters like the Sheriff didn t convince me They aren t all that important anyways I give Dark Remains a perfect ten rating for being ten times scarier than any recent studio ghost story Japanese remake
I m not at all picky about horror movies and I m willing to watch pretty much any of them That doesn t mean that I m willing to re watch many of them or that I won t have criticism for them This movie is creepy and is very well done In fact I think this movie would make an excellent double bill with Session 9 br br I should specify before I get to my comments that I watched this alone I started watching it before going to bed and got about 15 minutes in before I realized that it was too effective so I saved the rest of it for the morning Even while watching it in broad daylight it was still creepy However I can t vouch for how effective it would be when watching in a larger group br br After the death of their daughter a couple move to a remote cabin as a means of trying to come to terms with this death Let me make note of this death this is one of the rare movies that doesn t shy away from the death of a child This is much more important as it both sets the tone as well as explains much of the acting that permeates the movie br br The couple is not doing well The wife has distanced herself from the relationship and the husband is doing what he can to try to bring her back While some of the comments have complained about their acting one specified that they act more like a father and daughter than husband and wife and that s legitimate He s trying to give her more direction It s a role that men sometimes take on br br There are a variety of scares in the film and most are fairly non violent though grotesque in some ways The story itself feels very straightforward for most of the film and takes an odd turn near the end While the turn is not absurd it is certainly not what you expected from the way things had been progressing br br Moody atmospheric and very well done for something that appears to have been shot on video
First nobody can understand why this movie is rated so poorly Not only is this the first real horrific movie since a very long time for me who am pretty hard boiled with a decades long experience of horror starting with driving through dark rides ghost trains as a child Second the main actress Cheri Christian has a face that lets you hope she will be the leading actress in major pictures of the future Third this woman is that tremendously beautiful that I suggest the directors retire all those Cameron Diazes Eva Mendezes and how ever the names of these ephemeral bulb lights are Mrs Christian is not a light but a sun br br However Dark remains is also of considerable metaphysical importance They idea that photographs shows creatures of the intermediary reign between reality and imagination that are not visible with one own eyes is not new But I have never seen in a movie before that those creatures are visible on the photographs only for certain people and only to certain times This means that the photo is not just an iconic picture of reality by which reality turns into a sign but becomes an alternative form of reality which can change as the real reality can Being a sign the changing of the picture means that it influences the photographed objects i e the sign behaves like an object Now in our usual world of perception it is common that objects change signs F ex if someone grows a bird his photograph will show him with beard not without as it did before But the opposite the changing of objects by signs would imply that the photo with beard is first and only then the beard grows on the man This is very simply expressed the case that happen with the photos taken by the main character in the prison in this movie This is new and we must be thankful for everything new in horror movies which usually just repeat and reorder effects and features that are already well known mostly since the silent time
Allen and Julie move into a cabin in the mountains after their daughter is murdered one night No one knows who killed the little girl but it s why they moved to the mountains So the couple moves into this cabin and it s haunted by people who killed themselves there and no one in the nearby town wants to talk about it br br This movie has a lot of creepiness to it and it has a lot of parts that made me jump Some of the parts are predictable but once in a while there is a part I didn t expect It was a pretty good movie that wasn t the scariest movie in the world but it was still scary enough to make it pretty good br br I also liked the ending because it left the viewer to decide how it ends It is also kind of a sad movie as well but a well done horror movie
This movie was very good If you are one who likes to watch horror movies I recommend it The acting was very good although I thought that the actress playing Julie could have had more emotion behind her lines Allan was very good and I thought the cinematography was amazing I was on the edge of my seat the entire time while my friends were freaking out and screaming It was a complete success in my opinion and should have made it to the big screen I give it two thumbs up I definitely would say that if you haven t already seen it then go rent it If you have seen it and didn t like it go and watch it again because there are parts that were completely unreal I also liked how a lot of the movie was filmed around and on my school s campus
Following their daughter s brutal murder Julie and Allen escape the city to find solace and grieve in a solitary cabin on a remote mountain Allen s intentions are good he wants his wife to get out of her depression by resuming her photography Julie stumbles across an ancient prison and sees the perfect creepy decaying setting for her photography But when the photos are developed they are full of dead people and Allen quickly discovers the tragic history of suicide in their new mountain Dark Remains is a pretty decent indie horror flick It offers some genuine scares and plenty of tension The acting is fairly good and the cinematography is great 7 out of 10
After all the crap that Hollywood and the Indies have churned out we finally get a movie that delivers some scary moments There are some clich√©d moments but I m not sure it s possible nowadays to make an entirely original movie There s not much new here it s just done well br br Make sure and pay attention as the subtle scares come quickly and often This is not a movie to watch while you re eating pizza br br There s one very well written red herring in this movie and unfortunately one very poorly cast role Cheri Christian just doesn t make an effective Julie the wife mother For one thing she s totally unsympathetic I know I know she s just gone through a traumatic experience But the viewer never gets to know her as she normally is and the relationship between her and her husband is rather discomforting in an unintentional way I think that the director had meant for us to have some sympathy for her but I never did br br Finally a thumbs up for the ending which is both disturbing and satisfying It could easily have been cheapened with a sound effect at the beginning of the end credits but the director wisely resisted br br This is not a masterpiece by any means but it IS a good old fashioned scary movie something that s rather rare nowadays
Finally an indie film that actually delivers some great scares I see most horror films that come out Theatrical Straight To DVD cable etc and most of them suck a few are watchable even fewer are actually good Dark Remains is one of the good ones I caught a screening of this film at the South Padre Island Film Festival the audience loved it and my wife and I loved it Having no name actors I assume the budget on this film was pretty low but you wouldn t know it the film looks fantastic the acting totally works for the film the story is good and the scares are great While most filmmakers focus solely on the scares they often forget about story and character development two things that help to deliver the scares more efficiently Brian Avenet Bradley must know that character and story are important He develops both to the point where you care about the characters you know the characters and are therefore more scared when they are in danger br br Watching horror films that cost anywhere from 80 million to 5000 to make I find Dark Remains to be one of the gems out there Check this film out
What s Good About It Some inventive and genuinely creepy little effects that will get under the skin of even the most seasoned horror fan Doesn t rely on the hackneyed soundtrack stabs for its gotcha moments Even if you ve seen everything there s still a few things in this film that will make your jaw drop br br What Could Have Been Better About It The acting was at times flat and unconvincing It had a shot on video quality in some places though it mostly achieved the atmosphere it was striving for and the camera work is full of needless close ups of meaningless actions Though the effects are genuinely creepy I think they may have gone to the well a few too many times with some of them The ending seemed rushed and glossed over what could have been more impactful moments The viewer is left to figure out a lot of things for themselves not as a challenge by the filmmakers but because they just missed it br br Still a good little indie horror film that is easily several steps above the average Well worth the rental
For years we ve been watching every horror film that comes out from the dull Hollywood retreads like Saw 2 to awful indie releases that are completely unmatchable we suffer through all of bad films in hopes of finding little gems like Dark Remains br br We managed to catch a screening of this film at Shriekfest 2005 The audience loved it and I believe it ended up winning the award for the best film br br While it may not have the budget or star power of studio films it packs a serious punch in the creepy atmosphere and scare category The acting and cinematography are top notch but it s the direction that makes this film worth the view The story and characters develop at just the right pace to provide some fantastic scares br br The editing and visual fx are also top notch And while many horror films don t manage to use music to their benefit the score for Dark Remains only adds to it s creepiness br br I know the film has shown at a bunch of festivals but none have been near me so I can t wait to hear when it ll finally be coming out on DVD Trust me even if you re sick of the current state of horror films give this one a try you won t regret it
If you haven t already seen this movie of Mary Kate and Ashley s then all I can say is What Are You Waiting For This is yet another terrific and wonderful movie by the fraternal twins that we all know and love so much It s fun romantic exciting and absolutely breath taking scenery wise Of course as always Mary Kate and Ashley are the main scenery here anyway Would any true fan want it any other way Of course not Anyway it s a great movie in every sense of the word so if you haven t already seen it then you just have to now I mean right now too So what are you waiting for I promise that you won t be disappointed Sincerely Rick Morris
this movie is the best movie ever it has a lot of live action It s just great everyone should watch it and the actor are great the location is Rome Italy thats the best place ever the actors are great Mary Kate Olsen is such a great actress she plays Charlie and thats a great character and Ashley Olsen play Leila and thats a great character to love When in Rome love it
I always feel strange and guilty saying it because I m a fairly well educated non teenager but I actually sort of like the Olsen twins and I respect the movies they make even though I ve never really been their target audience When in Rome was a traditional Mary Kate and Ashley movie complete with the foreign travel accents motorbikes adult romance as a B storyline fashion orientation and even the gag reel over the credits I enjoyed myself When in Rome and the other Olsen twin movies never pretend to be anything they re not most of the time they only premiere on video and they never claim to be the next Citizen Kane or even An Affair to Remember My point is people who watch this movie and expect it to be anything other than another Olsen twin movie will be disappointed br br That said those who ARE fans of the Olsen twins will really enjoy themselves For those of us who ve watched them since the first episodes of Full House it s really great to see them growing into more mature roles This movie provides important historical and geographical information just like many of their other movies remember 10 Downing Street from Winning London and the visit to the Louvre from Passport to Paris as well as providing good clean fun that can be enjoyed by the whole family br br As long as I still feel like I m on my soapbox and as long as I can make it relevant to the movie let me take a moment to challenge those who reject the Olsen twins in order to be a fan of the Olsen twins you don t have to be some pre teen valley girl from California In fact that s not really the target audience If it were the MK A fashion line of clothes and accessories would be run through Gap or some store like that not Wal Mart When in Rome while it does feature high fashion and globe trotting and two girls from a valley in Cali isn t really ABOUT that it s more about inspiring young girls who have initiative to let it take them places If that means setting the movie in some glamorous foreign city with cute guys on motorbikes so be it That s called marketing you take an idea and sell it by making it appealing At least they re sending a good message even if the means seem a little superficial br br Basically don t knock the film until you ve seen it and then don t knock it until you ve tried to understand what the Olsen twins do they encourage young girls to be creative intuitive and driven young women This movie does that I think just like their others Kids enjoy Parents do the same If you like the Olsen twins you won t be disappointed
